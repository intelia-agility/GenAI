Despite my diligent efforts to rectify this issue through multiple communications, the company has continuously neglected its responsibility to acknowledge the legal discharge of my debt. I have acted in good faith by providing all necessary documentation to Westlake Services LLC, including the pertinent 1 copy B form that clearly indicates the forgiveness and discharge of the specified debt. I have also corresponded with all relevant parties, including the trustee Computershare Trust Company, in line with UCC 8-103, which delineates the rules for determining whether certain obligations and interests are securities or financial assets. It is imperative to note that the discharged debt in question should be treated as a financial asset ; hence, its discharge should promptly be reflected in my financial records. Despite these efforts, Westlake Services LLC has failed to update my credit report to accurately represent my financial standing, and has not reconciled their accounting records to reflect the discharged debt. This inaction has caused me significant financial harm, as it has adversely affected my credit score and has denied me access to financial opportunities that are predicated on an accurate credit history. Furthermore, I have not received the refund due to me for the discharged debt, which constitutes a return of value as per our agreement. The failure to provide this refund and the refusal to update my credit report is tantamount to security fraud, as it involves the mishandling of my taxes and securities. This is a clear breach of ethical and legal standards, and it diminishes the trust and confidence that consumers should be able to place in their financial institutions and services. Please be aware that in addition to this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I intend to file a Form 211 with the Treasury Ombudsman to initiate an audit of my account on both public and private fronts. This action is necessitated by the urgency to correct the financial misrepresentation that has been allowed to persist by Westlake Services LLC. I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action to ensure that Westlake Services LLC complies with all legal obligations to acknowledge the discharged debt in their records and on my credit report. I seek a prompt resolution that includes the following : 1. An immediate update to my credit report to reflect the discharged debt. 2. A reconciliation of Westlake Services LLC 's books to show the debt as forgiven and discharged. 3. A refund of the value of the discharged debt that was promised to me.I trust that the CFPB will address this complaint with the seriousness it deserves and will work to protect consumers like myself from such unjust financial practices.

2316,72638,2024-01-21,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Citi Cards lowered the credit limit many times since I got the Citi Diamond Preferred Credit Card. There was no valid reason because I had never missed a payment. One of the excuses they wrote on the notice mentioning that they lowered the limit, was that I had spent a high debt-to ratio amount. This is false because they were lowering the limit to get it closer to the amount I had spent, then falsely accusing me of spending too close to the limit. These two injustices on the part of Citi Cards, lowering the limit, then reporting me for spending too close to the limit caused me a lot of financial losses as I was starting my self-publishing business and was depending on my promised available credit to pay for the start-up costs of establishing the business. So, upon finding out that the amount on which I was depending had disappeared, I started applying to borrow from other sources. My applications for a loan were all declined because Citi Cards ' false reports had brought down my credit score from Excellent to poor. And the only credit cards who allowed me to borrow more were at an interest rate of over 35 % Citi Cards caused my credit score to go from ( the highest possible ) to in the Poor category. Plus, I had budgeted for a schedule of payments that I could afford, but when Citibank brought down the credit limit to less than what I had already borrowed, they not only lied to the credit bureaus that I spend above the credit limit, but they added the difference they went below my borrowed amount ( in this example {70 Exhibit Three ) to my monthly payment thus more than doubling the monthly payment ( see Exhibit Three again ) and including the total in the MINIMUM DUE to make it mandatory to pay it right then. This is clearly and obviously a case of stealing money by forcing the borrower to pay for a reason that they caused themselves. And the false report that I spend above my allowed limit lowered my credit score even further, caused more of my credit applications to be declined, AND ADDED TO THIS, the more one applies for credit, the lower the score goes down. THE TRUTH IS THAT I HAVE NEVER SPENT ONE CENT ABOVE THE AVAILABLE CREDIT when I make a purchase. I was always extra careful that my credit score wouldn't go down from to but NOW, THROUGH NO FAULT OF MINE, the score crashed to the lowest possible level.

Just by lowering multiple times the limit on which I was depending to cover the business startup costs, threw my whole planned budget off. it was a chain reaction that step by step brought down my credit score from the top level to the lowest and led to losing all the funds that I would have saved by now to pay off my credit card debts and pay for all the cost of setting up the business.

Bank of America Travel Rewards Credit Card With gratitude, as a loyal Bank of America active member with multiple years of great business with Bank of America, I need my Bank of America credit card account and great relationship with Bank of America to be opened. I have never missed a payment, have always paid in full or even extra than the statement amount, and have been exemplary in this. This is evident by the continuous negative balance as I have always paid my card in full. In the past 3 years or so, I have talked to many representatives who misheard me or gave me wrong information regarding my accounts when I was simply trying to get a new account number as someone was gaining access to my account and me misplacing my wallet. I was told it was an error but still have not gotten my card re-opened yet due to this error. Additionally, I never reported any fraudulent charges or activity at all and have always reported that my charges are valid. Someone in your department possibly misheard me and made a mistake that affected me negatively but I am willing to move forward from this as you re-open my credit card and avoid closing it or revoking it. I have contacted Bank of America several times through phone and sent multiple letters but no one has responded to me. Customer service, fraud department, and other departments just bounce me around. In the midst of all of the confusion, which was also my fault because of miscommunication, it triggered activity on my account leading to someone closing my account in error. I am also not very technologically savvy and have a It was a simple request to get new numbers due to someone gaining access to my account and me misplacing my wallet. I had not even gotten the chance to use my card fully which is what I was excited about. Moreover, this is going to hurt my credit score ( as I have a {17 credit limit on my credit card ) and will overall hurt my credit really badly so I want to avoid this. Moreover, due to this, I am unable to apply for a new credit card which I need for my travel, subscriptions, and medications. I am also traveling soon and will need my credit card. I have talked to countless representatives and associates even going directly to the bank but I have had no luck so far and no one has been able to help me. I am confident that in writing to you, I will get this resolved quickly and smoothly and get my Bank of America credit card re-opened promptly and I am very appreciative of this matter. I have developed an action plan and I pledge to you that I will do my due diligence moving forward to have optimal security avoid any misplacements or even fraudulent activity. I can assure you, this miscommunication and instance will never happen again, as I have took the proper measures to secure my accounts and identity. I also placed extra security including security alerts on both my social security card and the credit bureaus, changed my passwords to make them more secured, placed 2-factor authentications, and removed any authorized users. I am also happy to oblige and comply with any further action plans that Bank of America may want to ensure my security for my Bank of America credit card account moving forward including but not limited to any additional security measures you can work with me to ensure my accounts are safe and secure. As I have been, I assure you my credit card accounts will remain secure, satisfactory, safe, and, I assure you, there will be no further miscommunication or misunderstandings as I have now placed all the necessary security measures to avoid this issue happening again.

Upon review of my credit profile and most recent credit report, I have noticed that these charged-off accounts are inaccurately reflected, and I am demanding their suppression and deletion based on specific legal grounds. According to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) guidelines and federal case law, charge-offs are considered taxable income. In accordance with federal taxation statutes and established case law, income is defined as an accession to wealth, clearly delineated under the Sixteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Furthermore, case law, such as the landmark Supreme Court case Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co. ( 348 U.S. 426 ) solidifies the principle that income encompasses any accession to wealth, regardless of source, and is subject to taxation unless explicitly exempted by law. Given the aforementioned legal precedent and IRS classification of charge-offs as taxable income, it is evident that reporting charged-off accounts as part of one 's credit profile is erroneous and misleading. Charge-offs do not reflect ongoing financial obligations or active credit balances but rather constitute a tax consequence that is separate from the creditworthiness of an individual. I am hereby demanding that the charged-off accounts listed on my credit report be promptly suppressed and removed in adherence to federal law and the established legal understanding that charge-offs should not be part of one 's credit profile due to their classification as taxable income by the IRS. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) credit reporting agencies are obligated to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the information contained in consumer credit reports. As such, I expect your agency to take immediate action to rectify this discrepancy and expunge the aforementioned charged-off accounts from my credit report within 30 days of receipt of this letter. Failure to comply with this request within the stipulated timeframe will leave me with no choice but to pursue legal action to enforce my rights under the FCRA and seek remedies for the inaccuracies present in my credit report. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and expect a written response confirming the removal of the charged-off accounts from my credit report within the specified timeframe.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NJ,07002,,Consent provided,Web,2024-01-05,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,8112883,2024,1,5

In addition, users of the information for credit, insurance, or employment purposes must notify the consumer when an adverse action is taken on the basis of such reports. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act added many provisions to this Act primarily relating to record accuracy and identity theft. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau most of the rulemaking responsibilities added to this Act by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Credit CARD Act, but the Commission retains all its enforcement authority.

They were given multiple opportunities to not only remove the information from my profile in which I did not give them any consent, but to also prove that I owe them anything pursuant to an "" alleged loan that they so called gave me according to their representatives. '' They are also committing language fraud by use of certain words when it clearly states in their and documents at the top that they "" DO NOT COMMIT LANGUAGE FRAUD '' but they do just that. It says that they've signed in their security agreement with the under 17 CFR 424, that they will not commit language fraud or solicitation. I've also sent to them registered endorsed dividend bond securities that's owed to me as a silent investor, but yet they've kept them indicating they don't owe me anything can contest these events and is willing to be a witness to more than a couple incidents in this regard. They even went as far as telling me in writing that I don't have any rights and verbally as well. We have some of these phone conversations including them telling me that they couldn't accept anything other than a certified Bank check before stealing my consumer household goods. Prior to stealing my household consumer goods without just compensation, I warned them that they were breaking the consumer laws by ignoring my right to rescind any portion of the alleged sided agreement that I allegedly gave them consent to do. However, I believe that my information and signature may have been copied and pasted on other documents in order to bind us to these sided agreements by the dealer in which is unethical and fraudulently, including document forgery. I've also indicated to them that no one from their corporation showed up in person to give me any loan or money. Another thing that I've mentioned to them in the Affidavit regarding the rescission of my signature is that I do not want them to sell my information and to opt me out of that, including opting out of all the rights and interest given to them by trickery and usury and they replied that I don't have that right to do that. If this was done with false and misleading practices, then I have every right to take it back. The federal reserve states that banks and financial institutions can't lend on their own money. However, according to a friend of mine who has their own financial institution that lends to other investors, in which indicated that they pool notes from depositors or investors and lend other people 's money on fractional reserve including using certain IRS forms triple dipping. Their actions are contrary to 12 USC section 1431 and Duties of banks. The most troubling piece to this by far is that I've found out through a third party that they've made millions from my signature recently and my cosigner signature in the past constantly selling the same contract over and over again without even compensating us for the use of our signatures, because without us putting our signature on that document bringing value to it, then they couldn't make any profit or interests. For this matter, I've invoked the IRS for identity theft and tax evasion and how they are moving the money around that they are stealing from consumers. They used my household goods as a way to extort more money from me other than the note ( aka ) security that they received from me. As before and after taking my consumer household goods. They've used both the so-called contract as an asset including my personal property ( aka ) household goods. This is pure greed, usury slavery/peonage, fraud in the factum, deception, racketeering, theft by stealing our interests and putting it all into a pool with other investors while moving it all into trust for their indenture trustee to manage. Charges shall be brought upon all of these criminals and I'm seeking that all of their businesses and personal bank accounts be frozen until investigation is completed. I will be also sending the most recent affidavits that they've avoided to reply upon what was being requested as evidence, including an affidavit of truth for them to sign under penalty and perjury in good faith but was ignored, which validated and indicates their fraud and deception.

I'm seeking for them to remove the account from my credit profile. I'm also seeking for the FTC and FBI and IRS to investigate these matters as well for all other consumers. I no longer want to waste anymore time going back and forth with these individuals who are running these fraudulent businesses stealing money and interests from the true creditors. Something has to be done immediately about this because they will continue to violate me and others without any respect to the consumer laws or law in general. They are using Delaware because they can get away with fraud. Furthermore : I'm demanding that none of their or reach me or get involved in these matters because they have no first-hand knowledge of these matters and anything they say is hearsay. My issue is with the people who are hiding behind companies violating my rights by committing fraud in the factum, language fraud, and by deception to get wealthy. If any Attorney/Lawyer continues to help them, then this will only prove that they are aiding these individuals and they are also shall be treated as willful participants as for contributing to these actions. This is due to the fact that they know exactly what these individuals are doing but yet they participate in these illegal and unlawful actions willfully for currency. I refuse to accept anything else including any arguments from any of these people considering the fact that they waved all opportunities to cure these matters and it will only be a stalling tactic as usual.

I urge the FBI and the FTC to freeze both their personal and business assets to investigate this.

This is been going on for about four months now and its very frustrating because I feel like this bank is not listening to what i say and what is going on in the situation. every single time I call, I have to re-explain the entire situation which takes a while because it is four months of issues that I have to explain to somebody. they told me recently that the money taken from was only {5 instead of {15 which I do not completely believe considering I have been looking at the confirmation email on for months, saying a total of {15 was taken but I no longer can see the complete display of transactions in my checking account. I can only see about two now. I dont know if they somehow deleted those out of my checking account to make me believe only {5 was taken out, I dont want to accuse anybody but its very confusing. Frustrating on my end. one of the recent times I called, I had asked to speak to somebody higher up as I felt that nobody was meeting my needs and complaints and I got put through to a representative that handles escalated calls I asked what exactly his position is, as I told him that each time I had called, I had never raise my voice or spoken any profanity, so I dont understand why I asked to speak to someone higher up and they put me through to someone who deals with angry customers which I was not. they continue to tell me that they will send me an email and inbox message or call me about the status of my fraudulent claim and each time they have never done that.

WF would not allow me to do this because they were waiting until they received all of the funds since it was a large amount I had sent in emails, called several departments, each of them telling me that they would assign a case worker and they should get back to me within weeks.

I called to speak to her, but she was unable to take my call. I was informed by the person who answered the phone that they had sent an electric check back to the bank using the routing number I provided.

This has been going on for years and continues to damage my reputation and livelihood. I have sent proof that these accounts are inaccurate, incomplete and or are not mine in addition to the same account double reporting and reporting to other credible reporting agencies under a different name account information continues to do nothing but claim they will respond and then sends an irrelevant automated letter in the mail.

If you have multiple promo purchase charges open they used to apply your full payment to the oldest/one that would accrue interest soonest, which makes sense and is how the customer would want to pay off. Now however, they've switched the system to spread your payment across all the charges. So if you had a {30 expiring promo period and others not expiring for 5 months and put {30 towards your card it would put {10 to each rather than paying off the {30 allowing the one not paid to charge interest since the grace period then expired. When working with the company they have informed me that every time I make a payment I will need to reach out to customer service to ask them to allocate the payment to the expiring promotional charge. Every time. This is not customer friendly, but I've attempted to do this and each time they have not followed directions and paid off and spread the rest ( after being told to apply it to specific purchases that were expiring soonest for example ) Then when checking back to make a payment later it is seen that the interest has been charged on the payment the customer has assumed has been paid off. In other words, the customer has to keep a keen eye on checking back and contacting again to be sure their payment is done properly or carecredit charges interest that the consumer may not notice unless they checking back. This makes it quite easy to take advantage of customers, especially those who may not be as careful. And as this card is touted as good for medical payments, this can be a large class of people that are easy to take advantage of. This system seems to be set up for carecredit to make money off the interest charges that would otherwise not be accruing. My own payment has been fixed ( after multiple contacts with customer service and escalating to a manager ) I have put in complaints before but they only do it on their end and will not give you contacts to place your own complaint, so I'm not actually sure if complaints are actually ever placed with them or they just tell you they are to keep you quiet. I may have fixed my own issue, but I worry for the people that can't be as careful/on top of their payments that carecredit can take advantage of them too easily, since it does seem to be set up now for that to be the case.

1910,64316,2024-01-31,Checking or savings account,CD (Certificate of Deposit),Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"My mother had an online CD account with Synchrony Bank. Shortly after her passing in I notified Synchrony Bank and provided all the documentation and they subsequently updated the account profile in to reflect my name as a successor trustee. Fast forward to one year later in an attempt to close this account and distribute all funds remaining in her estate. Each time I called, they did not have on record that I was the successor trustee until they did further digging. It was very frustrating to have to explain this each and every time as some of the reps would be argumentative that they were still showing my mother as the account holder even though she was deceased, and I had provided her death certificate the previous year. Even though I have since received the funds that Synchrony Bank was holding, I have NEVER experienced such a long delay in receiving the monies that were due to us by closing her CD account. I feel that there must be some regulatory obligation for a financial institution to release these funds in a timely matter. It took an unreasonable amount of time ( 6 weeks ) from the time I had a fax confirmation . and potentially an additional 2 weeks for the mailed hard copy to arrive . which it never did. Apparently, the preprinted address on the envelope was wrong and the post office did not have a forwarding address so returned the mail to me which I did not receive until When I inquired Synchrony Bank told me they changed in That is a whole different issue which I feel should not have happened. In the end, I received the funds but I feel this delay needs to be reported to a regulatory agency as it seems extremely unreasonable to have to wait in excess of 42 calendar days for a financial institution to close out a CD account and I wasn't sure who could help me during that time.

As a consumer, I am entitled to ensure the protection of my private information, as supported by 15 USC 6801, which states It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information. '' The entity providing information to credit agencies, commonly known as the 'Furnisher of information, ' qualifies as a financial institution under this title. According to 15 USC 1681, Section 604 a ( 2 ) a consumer reporting agency may only furnish a consumer report in accordance with the written instructions of the relevant consumer. In this case, both the financial institution ( Furnisher of information ) and the consumer reporting agencies and TransUnion lack my consent and, specifically, my written consent to furnish this information. Referring to 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) which states that A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. Unfortunately, the furnisher of information did not inform me of my right to exercise this option.Furthermore, 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) explicitly states Except as authorized under subsection ( b ) no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information : Any other adverse item of information, other than records of convictions of crimes which antedates the report by more than seven years. Therefore, reporting this adverse item without my permission is a violation of the law.According to 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A, A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681e mandates that every consumer reporting agency must maintain reasonable procedures to avoid violations of section 1681c and limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b and TransUnion appear to be failing in maintaining these reasonable procedures. Furthermore, as per 12 CFR 1016.7 and TransUnion have failed to comply with all the laws mentioned above. I, the consumer, am rescinding any previous authorization given to whether it was written, unwritten, verbal, or nonverbal, to report ANY of my transaction history to ANY credit bureau. Not only am I opting out of all or any authorization, but I am also requesting that cease and desist immediately from all illegal activities. Finally, the CFPB is required to contact the consumer reporting agencies to update my consumer credit profile accordingly, specially for any transactions that has reported or any other transaction history or experiences I have with please have them fix these violations by deleting these transactions from my consumer report.

Background : I am the duly appointed and acting trustee for the established for the benefit of On the trust, through my authorized actions, entered into an agreement with State Farm for the purchase of an ABS designated as application. This agreement stipulated the creation of a dedicated special deposit account within the trust 's accounting framework to hold the funds earmarked for the ABS purchase. As per the accounting records reflected on the balance sheet, under the "" Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable '' section, the extension of credit from the trust 's cestui que trust account to State Farm for the ABS purchase is duly documented. This extension of credit directly funded the special deposit account, establishing a clear link between the trust 's assets and the specific funds held in the designated account. Unfortunately, on breach of fiduciary duties. the corporation became insolvent or misappropriated funds ]. As a result of this breach of fiduciary duties, the trust 's ability to access the special deposit funds and fulfill its obligations related to the ABS purchase has been jeopardized. Claim of Equitable Subrogation : Under the established legal principle of equitable subrogation, a party who pays off the debt or obligation of another is entitled to the same rights and remedies against the debtor as the original creditor possessed. In this instance, the trust, through the extension of credit from its cestui que trust account, effectively became a creditor of State Farm with respect to the funds held in the special deposit account designated for the ABS purchase. Therefore, due to State Farm 's breach of fiduciary duties, the trust, acting through me as the trustee, is entitled to step into the shoes of the original creditor and claim the immediate return of the special deposit funds in full. This claim is further supported by the documented extension of credit reflected in the trust 's accounting records and the clear designation of the special deposit account for the ABS purchase. Demand for Payment : I hereby demand the immediate and unconditional return of from the special deposit account associated with Account Payment should be made directly to the designated trust account at the following details I expect a prompt response to this demand and confirmation of the date on which the funds will be returned. Should State Farm fail to comply with this demand within 3 business days, I will be forced to pursue all available legal remedies to protect the trust 's rights, including but not limited to initiating legal action to recover the full amount of the special deposit funds, along with any accrued interest and legal fees. I trust that we can resolve this matter amicably and efficiently. Please do not hesitate to contact me at or discuss this matter further.

Argued January 6, 1997-Decided April 21, 1997 Respondents, five Arizona mothers whose children are eligible for state child support services under Title IV -D of the Social Security Act, filed this 42 U. S. C. 1983 suit against petitioner, the director of the state child support agency, claiming, among other things, that they properly applied for child support services ; that, despite their good faith efforts to cooperate, the agency never took adequate steps to obtain child support payments for them ; that these omissions were largely attributable to staff shortages and other structural defects in the State 's program ; and that these systemic failures violated their individual rights under Title IV-D to have all mandated services delivered in substantial compliance with the title and its implementing regulations. They requested broad relief, including a declaratory judgment that the Arizona program 's operation violates Title IV -D provisions creating rights in them that are enforceable through a 1983 action, and an injunction requiring the director to achieve substantial compliance with Title IV-D throughout all programmatic operations. The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Without distinguishing among the numerous provisions of the complex Title IV-D program or the many rights those provisions might have created, the latter court held that respondents had an enforceable individual right to have the State achieve "" substantial compliance '' with Title IV-D. It also disagreed with the District Court 's conclusion that Congress had foreclosed private Title IV-D enforcement actions by authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services ( Secretary ) to audit and cut off funds to States whose programs do not substantially comply with Title IV-D 's requirements Held : Title IV-D does not give individuals a federal right to force a state agency to substantially comply with Title IV-D. Pp.340-349. a ) A plaintiff seeking 1983 redress must assert the violation of a federal right, not merely of federal law. Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 106. Three principal factors determine whether a statutory provision creates a privately enforceable right : ( 1 ) whether the plaintiff is an intended beneficiary of the statute ; ( 2 ) whether the plaintiff 's asserted interests are not so vague and amor-phous as to be beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce ; and ( 3 ) whether the statute imposes a binding obligation on the State. See, e. g. Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn. 496 U. S. 498, 509. Even if a plaintiff demonstrates such a right, however, there is only a rebuttable presumption that it is enforceable under 1983. Dismissal is proper if Congress specifically foreclosed a 1983 remedy, Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992, 1 n. 9, 1 either expressly, by forbidding recourse to 1983 in the statute itself, or impliedly, by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual 1983 enforcement, Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S. 107, 133. pp. 340-341. b ) Respondents have not established that Title IV-D gives them individually enforceable federal rights. In prior cases, the Court has been able to determine whether or not a statute created such rights because the plaintiffs articulated, and lower courts evaluated, welldefined claims. See, e. g. Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418, 430. Here, respondents have not identified with particularity the rights they claim, and the Ninth Circuit has not engaged in the requisite methodical inquiry. That court erred in apparently holding that individuals have an enforceable right to "" substantial compliance '' with Title IV-D in all respects. The statutory "" substantial compliance '' requirement, see, e. g. 42 U. S. C. 609 ( a ) ( 8 ) ( 1994 ed. Supp. II ) does not give rise to individual rights ; it was not intended to benefit individual children and custodial parents, but is simply a yardstick for the Secretary to measure the systemwide performance of a State 's Title IV-D program, allowing her to increase the frequency of audits and reduce the State 's federal grant upon a finding of substantial noncompliance. The Court of Appeals also erred in taking a blanket approach to determining whether Title IV-D creates rights : It is readily apparent that many of the provisions of that multifaceted statutory scheme, including its "" substantial compliance '' standard and data processing, staffing, and organizational requirements, do not fit any of the traditional criteria for identifying statutory rights. Although this Court does not foreclose the possibility that some Title IV-D provisions give rise to individual rights, the Ninth Circuit did not separate out the particular rights it believed arise from the statutory scheme, the complaint is less than clear in this regard, and it is not certain whether respondents sought any relief more specific than a declaration that their "" rights '' were being violated and an injunction forcing petitioner to "" substantially comply '' with all of Title IV-D 's provisions. This defect is best addressed by sending the case back for the District Court to construe the complaint in the first instance, in order to determine exactly what rights, considered in their most concrete, specific form, respondents are asserting. Only by manageably breaking down the 42 U.S. Code 1983 - Civil action for deprivation of rights Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officers judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.

My grandfather bought this land 40 years ago and this home loan that is managed by Shellpoint was taken out in This is the home that our family grew up in. When my mother passed in I the daughter and rightful heir was living with her and my aunt was executor of the will and contacted Shellpoint and told them that the house had been deeded to me and my sister and that I would be taking over the mortgage payments. I am contacting your agency because I am very concerned about the way that Shellpoint has handled the servicing of this loan since I became the owner. Our family has paid as agreed for nearly 25 years and this loan is close to being paid off. However due to the questionable business practices of Shellpoint and employee I am facing foreclosure on our family legacy. They have denied me access to assistance programs to help me resolve missed payments and have not played fair or been reasonable. I took over the mortgage payments not long after my mother passed. In early my hours were reduced at my job and I had just been ( ages and ) The combination of income loss and additional expenses to care for the children who were now living with me was overwhelming and I missed the mortgage payment in I contacted Shellpoint in to discuss options to help with the mortgage payment. I was told I could apply for assistance programs online but had trouble with their system and after multiple attempts ended up scheduling a phone call in which the agent questioned me about the household income and expenses at that time. Shellpoint came back a few weeks later but I was not offered a loan modification or deferment or any type of real help ; instead their agent offered a payment plan which required me to bring in a {5 lump sum down payment plus the regular mortgage payment ( total of about {62 ) This was difficult to afford at that time but I was able to scramble and get the money together but then my car broke down and it cost over {1 to repair and it was necessary for me to keep my job so I paid for the repair. . I emailed my Shellpoint contact to tell him I had the majority of the payment and asked if I could have an extension until to pay the full amount said that there were no options and that the plan would be cancelled because I would be late with 1 % of the funds. I then asked if there was a way they could try to do a new repayment plan or review me for some other type of plan - -he said that the account was being pushed into foreclosure status in He said they would only accept full reinstatement of funds and that the money had to come via wire transfer or certified funds. Shellpoint denied access to programs designed to assist struggling borrowers based on a verbal interview of income and expenses at that time. Shellpoint has pushed our home into foreclosure without ever reviewing our current and correct financial information. Our financial circumstances have changed as I am back working full time as as well as becoming a business. Additionally my father has moved in and is contributing towards the household expenses with his retirement income. The only option Shellpoint considered was a repayment plan with a huge down payment on our home that we have lived in for 24 years.

The same exact thing was done with account number account ending in The dispute was made, stating the amount is incorrect and payments are not being reflected on my accounts sent me a response back stating the creditor told them they were reporting this correctly despite my documentation I provided. Regardless if they have the amounts incorrect they are not posting my payments which is against the law. I contacted to find out what the problem is and what documentation is the creditor providing to prove they are reporting correctly. They refused to give me that information so I asked if they actually provided documentation or did they just call them to ask if they were reporting correctly, they refused to give me that information as well. I then proceeded to ask them if the documentation I provided even mattered, and the said NO, it only mattered if the creditor stated they were reporting correctly. I explained that I provided a settlement letter directly from stating the agreement and it shouldn't matter what they say on the phone that I have it in writing and they are not reporting the correct information. They stated I needed to contact the creditor myself and that they can not do anything to change the report. I asked for a supervisor, they kept me on hold for an hour, the next person stated he was a supervisor named and he basically told me the same thing and refused to do anything about my report. I asked where they were located and if they were in the United States because everyone I had spoken to had very broken and he refused to tell me if they were in the United States, he stated he did not care that I had documentation and that they believed the creditor over me but couldn't and wouldn't tell me if they have documentation to prove they were reporting correctly. I told him it is illegal for them not to be reporting my payments each month and he stated he did not care, and proceeded to talk over me. I then asked for someone over him as I contacted your office They hung up on me multiple times, and on the final call he put me on hold for a supervisor, another long call, the lady came on stated that I have exceeded my hold time and that I would have to call back? Who does that? Especially a company that is handling all our critical, vital credit information? All of this is recorded on their end but I doubt they will provide all of the portions of the call. Regardless they were unprofessional and were not abiding by the law because I have been making payments which were not reflected on the report which they must report every month, and the amounts were incorrect per 's settlement letter. I have attempted to contact 10 times today and left a message at Central time with the information and nobody has called back. I keep calling and they will not let you hold for a person longer than a few minutes and then disconnects the phone call if their call center is not located in the United States we could have some serious security breaches because they have everyone 's social security information and basically everything about everyone, but if they are located in the US then they are extremely unprofessional with the constant hang up 's, stating my hold time has exceeded their acceptable hold time which is ludicrous because is that not what they are here to do is correct our incorrect information which brings me to the fact they basically disregarded my documentation from the collection agency that was written in their ) own words that there is a settlement! What else do I need to do to get my report corrected when I have documentation directly from the collection agency does not care about our credit information as they told me on the phone.

Closing the account resulted in negative points on my credit report, while still having to make on time payments and pay interest. Upon learning of this I contact Citi executive offices due to my disappointed. After investigation CITI revealed the reason for the closure was due to a debt that was charged off in and sold to a debt collection company in This was concerning due to a number of reasons which Ill explain below.1. Citi pulled a credit report prior to deciding to reissue the card without notice of the credit check. 2. Citi reviewed internal records to make an adverse decision that affected me and according to the FCRA this was done incorrectly and caused damages to me.3. Citi has started company wide layoffs and informed regulators that this is due to a drop in revenue. However it is clear the drop in revenue is being caused by citi themsleves by shedding on time paying customers for no reason.4. CIti SOLD the debt and no longer owns it but makes decisions based on the debt. These reasons are concerning but most important is the fact that Citi themselves had trouble and needed a bailout from the American people due to their financial decisions in Now in after being a good customer and never being late Citi decides my past financial decisions should affect my current life. When pressed on this issue and reaching out to the Executive office of Citi I'm told its a private business and they can do what they want even violate the FCRA and cause personal damages to me. When reading online of other peoples issues of same its clear CITI makes adverse decisions to card holders and account holders with ZERO accountability and hides behind being a private business. .yet is publicly traded on the stock exchange.

I had this account placed on auto pay from the time it was opened up until FORTIVA deceptively charged me a late fee and refused to provide any help or remedy besides taking the payment and applying it to the balance on the account. FORTIVA has since then been continuing to violate my consumer rights and has harassed me calling me all times of the day with over 20 phone calls in the month of alone causing me severe emotional distress. I just received a call from a FORTIVA representative at on and when I asked if they would not call me so late, he rudely stated is it not for you? Regardless of what time their company hours are, I explained to him that was severely inconvenient as I was putting both my toddler and infant to bed and have to wake up extremely early to get them ready. The very next day on I received another call from FORTIVA at which blatantly shows the lack of respect for consumer rights. Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices debt collectors are prohibited from placing repeated or continuous telephone calls to you or having telephone conversations with you with the intent to annoy, abuse, or harass you.

I offered to pay the bill with the removed late fee when FORTIVA called me initially before the payments began to add up and FORTIVA refused that payment and only wanted the full payment with the incorrect late fee charge.

About one month after this happened, I requested a copy of my ChexSystems report only to find out that this financial institution had reported me to Chexsystems in a very negative and damaging way and with no reason to do so at all. They had submitted a negative report stating that i had applied for an account and had possibly given them false information when I applied. I was shocked when I read this negative entry on my consumer report and I immediately contacted this financial instituion by phone to find out why on earth would they report such a thing about me and why had nobody tried to reach out to me in any way prior to submitting this harmful information to Chexsystems. I told the lady that I spoke to over the phone that this was completely innacurate information that they are reporting on me and that I never gave them any false information on my application at any time and that all of the information that was given to them was complete and accurate and that there was nothing false about any of it. I offered to send them copies of my Identification and whatever identifying documents that they needed to confirm that my info was not false and that they should delete that erroneous consumer report entry that they had made with Chexsystems immediately as it is damaging my credit, my name, my reputation, and my ability to open an account anywhere while this info is being reported. The lady told me that she would look into this and I would hear back from her within the next couple of days. After about 30 days later, I never heard back from the bank about this issue and was unsuccesful at trying to reach her by phone afterwards. So i filed a dispute with Chexsystems in hopes of them resolving this issue for me. After my dispute was submitted, the information came back as being verified by the bank and nothing was removed from the consumer report. To this day, this negative entry still remains on my Chexsystems report and I have had no luck in getting it removed from my report with them. I even submitted copies of my identification, social security card, a utility bill so that they could match the information on my documents with the information that was used when I had submitted my new account application with for them to see that I had never given them any false information when I had applied for my account, but nothing changed. I don't understand how a bank can just send negative reports to consumer agencies with no merit or proof of what they are reporting to these companies. They just report to them whatever thay feel like reporting and Chexsystems never verifies with them that what they are reporting is indeed an accurate report ; they just accept the reported info and place it in our consumer report for the whole world to see and thus damaging my credit and reputation and my ability to have an account anywhere because of this. They are not being regulated properly because nobody is bothering to verify the things that these financial institutions report. They are just accepted at face value and that is it. How can this erroneous information still remain in my consumer report with Chexsytems after I had disputed it and sent them proof that I am who I say I was and that I never gave this bank any false information whatsoever and at any time? Again, who is regulating these companies because clearly they are not being overseen because of instances like this? This is unnaceptable behavior on both of these companies and I demand that this negative credit entry be removed immediately and an apology be given from both of these companies for continuing to keep this erroneous information on my report which has caused me much harm while being there. Also, I want to reopen the account they closed for me because of how they have damaged my name and my ability to gain any type of account with anybody else because of this false reporting on their end.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

When the home was under contract I requested another payoff for the anticipated closing date The closing was postponed 5 days beyond the "" Payoff Good Thru Date '' on payoff # 2 which was Payoff # 3 had a Payoff Good Thru Date of which was 23 days after my closing. This is a multi-part mortgage payoff refund. Part 1 is the 23 extra days of interest on the mortgage. Part 2 is because the Escrow portion of the loan payoff was never pro-rated to just the 4 days I owned the home in the Quarter for the purpose of Real Estate taxes and other Escrow items. The quarter began on and my closing was on I paid for the entire quarter of Escrow but this was too much. This was obvious to me even before the closing was completed because the difference between the Escrow portion of payoff figures in vs were huge despite the home only being owned until If you compare the payoff figures between vs vs and take into consideration the amount of time that would impact the increase in payoff dollars, the amounts do not make sense. I called M & T bank before the closing and was told it would be reviewed about 2 weeks after the payoff was fully processed. They estimated the payoff would take 2 weeks so the overpayment should have been completed by early While I realize there are waiting periods for M & T Bank to respond, I have already sent them a written formal complaint via certified mail on M & T bank has acknowledged receiving that complaint but constantly gives me the runaround indicating that a different department is handling it and then promising to call me back in a few days but never does. This is ridiculous. The pro-rating of a payoff is not a difficult process and it is done by banks and title companies many times a day in the course of selling homes and accepting other types of final loan payoffs. I have received a small check with no explanation of how the funds were distributed or any accounting for the difference in interest OR escrow. I believe that because this home was in pre-foreclosure, the bank and the law firm that reportedly represented them feels they can charge whatever they want without explanation and the homeowner has no recourse.

Upon meticulous examination, it is abundantly clear that Wells Fargo Dealer Services is in blatant violation of 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( b ) by failing to adopt reasonable procedures for verifying the receipt of billing statements by consumers. The absence of a robust system to confirm whether I, as the consumer, am physically receiving paper statements or accessing electronic statements constitutes a direct infringement of this federal law.This egregious violation not only questions Wells Fargo Dealer Services ' commitment to compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( b ) but also undermines the very essence of the law, which mandates creditors to adopt reasonable measures to prevent the erroneous treatment of payments as late for any purpose. Furthermore, the disregard for 15 U.S.C. 1611 ( 1 ) which unequivocally prohibits the furnishing of false or inaccurate information, is both alarming and unacceptable. The lack of a reliable verification process concerning the receipt of billing statements calls into question the accuracy of the information reported by Wells Fargo Dealer Services, especially regarding late payments. I must underscore the gravity of these violations under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which explicitly addresses willful non-compliance with federal law. Whether Wells Fargo Dealer Services was previously aware or not of its inability to report late payments, this ignorance is no excuse for the severe breaches of consumer rights. Additionally, I draw your attention to 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, highlighting that furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies are obligated to provide accurate and complete information. Wells Fargo Dealer Services ' failure to meet these obligations further compounds the severity of these violations.In light of Wells Fargo Dealer Services ' violation of 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( b ) I request that my account status be promptly updated to "" paid as agreed. '' The failure to adopt reasonable procedures to verify the receipt of billing statements has not only compromised the accuracy of late payment reporting but also warrants corrective action to rectify any adverse impact on my credit history.

I am writing to you regarding some substantial concerns I have uncovered during my thorough examination of the operations of Synchrony Bank As a conscientious consumer and advocate for ethical business practices, I believe it is crucial to bring these matters to your attention for immediate investigation and resolution. 1. Opting Out Violation ( 15 USC 6802-6805 ) : Upon reviewing the legal framework provided by 15 USC 6802-6805 , which empowers consumers to opt out of financial information sharing with institutions, I have observed potential instances where Synchrony Bank , and might not be fully adhering to these statutory provisions. This has raised concerns about the protection of consumer privacy rights. It is my earnest request that your team conducts a comprehensive review and takes necessary steps to rectify any non-compliance issues promptly. 2. Credit Report Accuracy Infringement ( 15 USC 1681 ) : In the course of scrutinizing my credit report obtained from and , I have uncover discrepancies that may be in violation of 15 USC 1681. This crucial federal law mandates the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting, placing a responsibility on entities like , Synchrony Bank to conduct thorough investigations and promptly rectify any inaccuracies. Ensuring compliance with this law is vital for maintaining consumer trust and confidence. 3. CFPB Complaints Negligence : My investigation has brought to light a potential neglect in addressing and resolving complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Failure to actively engage with and resolve these complaints is a direct violation of CFPB regulations. I urge , Synchrony Bank to conduct an in-depth internal review, recognizing and rectifying any shortcomings in addressing outstanding complaints. This proactive approach is not only essential for regulatory compliance but also crucial for upholding the reputation of your organization. 4. Privacy Act of 1974 Non-Compliance ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) : Preliminary findings suggest a potential non-compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This federal legislation mandates precise management of personal information by government entities. Any deviation from its stipulations requires immediate attention. I strongly recommend that Synchrony Bank initiates an immediate internal audit to ensure strict adherence to the Privacy Act. Proactive steps in this regard will not only align the organization with legal mandates but also enhance overall data protection measures. 5. General Redress and Compensation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n ) : The collective impact of these infringements has resulted in both quantifiable and intangible harm. In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681n, I formally demand , Synchrony Bank to provide due compensation for the distress and material losses borne as a direct consequence of these transgressions. This includes but is not limited to the time and effort expended in rectifying inaccuracies, emotional distress, and any financial repercussions suffered. To facilitate a fair and swift resolution, I kindly request a comprehensive response addressing each of the highlighted concerns within [ a reasonable timeframe, e.g. 30 days ].

232340,786393,2024-01-03,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"On I financed a for a total price of {48 through a car dealership. During the purchase process, the dealership insisted that I also purchase a warranty for {26 claiming that it was necessary to include it in order to obtain the vehicle. I later discovered that the warranty was not necessary for the purchase, and furthermore, it did not provide the coverage that was promised. The warranty company has a reputation for non-payment and refusal to cover bills, which has resulted in mechanic liens on vehicles. After considerable effort, I was able to secure a refund for the warranty, which was applied to my loan. However, I discovered that I was being charged interest on the combined amount of the loan and warranty, even though I did not want or need the warranty. In my vehicle was involved in a hit and run incident, resulting in it being totaled. While waiting for payment from my insurance company which should have covered the entire loan, I missed a monthly payment and was promptly reported to the credit bureau. I have been reported for non-payment almost every month since then, even when I have made my payments on time. Furthermore, I have been charged a {10 late fee every month, even when payments were made on time is being reported that I didnt make a payment, which I did make a payment of {210 Also before the negative comments per placed on my credit report, I was not at all informed by letter what was going to be reported, especially negative remarks. I was harassed with phone calls when payments were not made on time, starting the next day. They would change their phone numbers and call up to four times a day. The law states that they can not call more than 7 times in a 7 day period. Additionally, Credit Acceptance, the financing company, does not provide any records of previous payments or financial information on their website. There is no breakdown of how payments are allocated towards the loan, and additional expenses, such as the late payment fees I was incorrectly charged, are added without explanation. It was only today, several days after closing my account, that I was able to access a list of my transactions. The record keeping by Credit Acceptance is untrustworthy and does not adhere to proper mathematical calculations. For example, my credit report stated that I made a {49 payment, while in reality, it was {5 On another occasion, my credit report indicated that I had decreased my loan by "" {87 '' over two months, when I had actually made a {210 payment. There are numerous discrepancies, and the amount owed never matches what was previously communicated by the company 's representatives. Upon receiving insurance funds ( {5 ) a refund from the warranty ( {26 ) and payments made since ( {29 ) Credit Acceptance informed me that I still owed over {3 When I inquired about this, I discovered that they had added the insurance and warranty refund to the total loan amount and not the principal of the loan. After numerous conversations with representatives and the collection department, I was offered a payment of {6 to pay off the loan in full and have it reported as being in good standing to the credit bureaus. I made this payment, and the account was closed on However, when I checked my credit report on it stated that I was delinquent on my loan and over 30 days late in making a payment. As a result, my credit score dropped by 30 points. Due to Credit Acceptance 's inaccurate reporting, my credit score has dropped a total of points since I have been diligently working to pay off my debts, including student loans, in order to improve my credit score. However, the inaccuracies caused by C.A. are hindering my progress and preventing me from obtaining a new car or finding housing. I was relying on the improvement in my credit score to secure an auto loan with a lower interest rate than the 22 % being charged by Credit Acceptance. When the account was paid off, C.A. reported Settled for less. This is not at all the truth! Because of this comment on my credit report I am unable to get any auto lender to lend to me. I was behind at one point with payments from a job loss. I was making arrangements to make it up to date prior to my accident. When I contacted C.A. to address the reporting inaccuracies, I was instructed to contact the credit bureaus and fill out a dispute form through credit acceptance. This has only added to the difficulties and inconveniences caused by C.A. 's careless employees. And prolonging my ability to purchase a vehicle that I desperately need. I sent online and mailed in disputes with all three credit bureaus and one directly to credit acceptance from the form that they sent me in the mail. Credit Acceptance 's practices, which include predatory lending and irresponsible reporting, have severely impacted my financial situation and creditworthiness. I will be reporting them to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Michigan Attorney General 's office. I will escalate this to a lawyer if need be, and potentially find others to make a class action lawsuit. I will also bring this matter to the news/media. I kindly request that credit acceptance remove this disputed information from my credit report in order to rectify the damage caused. Thank you for your assistance.

On I signed up for usps informed delivery. Upon doing so, I realized that a mail from should have been delivered to me on At this point, I had no confirmation that this was in fact the check. I opened a case with the Usps for lost mail. The post office eventually reached out to me and advised that they would be better able to assist me with the tracking number. They advised it would be best if I get the tracking number from the sender. On I proceeded to contact my former sales rep being that thats the only contact I had for the builder side of and my actual contract. I asked if that could have been the check and he advised that more than likely it was. I asked if he could inquire about a tracking number so I could get more information from usps. I also asked if he could see about having the check stopped. He advised he would look into this and call me back did not reach back out to me regarding this. Being that I am still in the market for a home I reached out to again on regarding a property. During this call, I asked for an update on the inquiry regarding the check. He advised me that he would need some additional time as well as a reminder from me after the new year being that most people were off. On I called and didnt get an answer. I proceeded to send a reminder about the check via text returned my call and I verbally asked for an update on the check status i.e. tracking number, stop order or a contact number for the correct contact to speak to further about this told me he would get back to me and did not. At this point, my realtor was in touch with another sales agent and I begged my realtor to see if she could get any information even if its just a contact for me to find out more information being that was not forthcoming. On I was sent an image which the agent shared with my realtor, showing that the check was cashed on This agent also provided my realtor with an image of the back of the check showing that a person printed my name for endorsement under which another name was printed. Along with this update, provided to me by my realtor, I was also told that advised that they will not be assisting me any further with this because the check was cashed. I do not quite understand that because I did not receive this check. The check was not signed by me. This check was not cashed by me. The check did not make it my mailbox. I have no idea whose name was written below my name on the image that shared. I have been desperately trying to get help with this situation for weeks. I struggled to get in touch with someone who could help or cared to help. If I call the numbers its for sales reps. When I call the division of numbers it directs me to the website if your issue is not that of an existing homeowner, issue for the title office or a homebuyer. I was only able to get your contact by calling a number for the and they put me through to customer care coordinator who was very helpful in providing me with email addresses. I eventually got a response from the vice president of finance who basically told me that I need to reach out to my bank or the bank that cashed the check. My bank has nothing to do with this because I never received a check to present to them. How will I know which bank a thief cashed/deposited a check to mailed a check to me because Im contractually obligated to a refund. The check was not delivered to my address. How am I responsible for this? How is not responsible for getting in touch with their bank to report the fraud that has been committed against their account from which the funds were fraudulently drawn and reissue my refund per the contract? I even went to my local police station and they advised that being that we dont know who stole the check or where the check was stolen from the best recourse is for the sender to report fraud is wrong and heartless in this matter. I went as far as call which is the issuing bank of their check and of course they can not help me because its not my account but when I explained what happened to them they advised that can open A fraud case with their bank and report the fraud that was committed against their account finds it easier to just turn a blind eye than to do the right thing.

Before my husband was out of town trying to get money to me because they paid after the holiday instead of before the holidays. Thats not my complaint. We sent it After waiting several hours I had to call them in which they told me no transaction existed. So we were about to cancel and leave me with no money at all and the money comes through so one transaction did exist. Last Saturday my husband was still out of town. I had no money at all and went to cash out my account and paid $ and it was Sunday approximately and this was only the second time and they never put that through. I called several times. I was out of food and essentials. They told me they locked my card because I left my debit card as my default card on I didnt know a transaction. Went through. Someone turns the blame on me. That was hours ago and the woman told me the night before it would be there Monday and the second time I called I was still with out food and pet food and anything and the did not go through. I was panicking. Im like it has to go through anyway. It doesnt go through cash out because they actually a real deposit through and that never came through. I was crying and had no good. So then they put the Mon through Tues late and took out my money in the mean time my husband me a dollar and I received it and I said me $ to eat and buy essentials through the email Im using with you right now. Hours later almost 8 hours go by. I had nothing to eat in two days and they didnt put the through. This was a very serious situation. I called the lady to be made fun out sarcastic because I tolD her I didnt eat in almost three days because of their Bank errors. They never sent the She hung up on me. I was hysterically crying starving and I needed a prescription and could not get my prescription. I called my parents to ask them to me from Florida as I was in a very detrimental Situation. They had no problem $ comes through within 5 minutes. My husband at about 12 hours later gets a message from his bank telling him that BMO fraud the he put through earlier when they the transaction didnt exist and hung up and made fun out of me for being hungry without medicine for days. So I still have $ after getting groceries and medicine through my parents same account they told my husband bank was a fake email. Its not a fake email. Thru wouldnt let me see my bank information or even get get earlier that day never thing was getting declined. They were saying the bank credentials dont exist. Then later I put the same credentials in. It worked. So my now my husband at finally got frustrated because they are lying about things making fun out me being hungry and not having food and hanging up me. He sent money through money and paid for instant transaction and I still didnt get it. They have messed up and lied about every deposit thats been sent. Now were paying and nothing is going through worked fine but my husband showed me the confirmation. There was no mistake. Only because they know its a matter of emergency. They made fun out me.

2200,69583,2024-02-04,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Repossession,Loan balance remaining after the vehicle is repossessed and sold,"First I have several situations pertaining to this matter. I was only able to click one. So I will list the rest within this complaint. My vehicle was repossessed in Texas while visiting family for I dont live in the state of Texas I live in Arkansas. So when they repossessed my vehicle which I feel they shouldve told me knowing that Im a resident of Arkansas that they was taking the vehicle. It was parked outside of a hotel. By them doing this me and my family was stranded in Texas for over 2 weeks. I never once hid the vehicle. When I arrived to retrieve my belongings out of the car. There was real bad front bumper damaged done to the car. Looks as if it was hanging at some point. Due to the zip ties I saw. That was not there. I called the finance company and they told me to contact the towing company. Which I feel the finance company shouldve done since they hired this company. They damaged my property. I have a video of the car. There also was a dent that wasnt there either. It was right above the fender on the drivers side above the tire. The ONLY documented damage to my car was on the passenger side due to someone side swiping me. That happened in It was scheduled to repairs in That couldnt happen when they had repossessed my vehicle in Next, they really didnt give me the opportunity to try to get my vehicle back. They sent a letter stating that they have my vehicle and something about it being sold. They did not send me any information about the sale of my vehicle, the date, time nor the place of the auction. So this wouldve gave me a chance to retrieve my vehicle back. According to the Arkansas law. They was supposed to notify me through a letter. Texas law is the same as well. So with that, that gave me NO chance at ALL to try to get my vehicle back in good standing. This financial company really doesnt work or try to work with you on your financial breakdowns. They dont refinance, they offer one hold back if you cant pay your note. But it has to be in good standing. Ive tried to get back on track. There was things that transpired while trying to pay for my loan. Missing lots of work due to workplace injurys, roommate left, left me with all of the responsibilities while they broke our lease doing so. Family members getting at that time it was 14 days so it was lots of things that had me behind. But for them to not notify me of the sale and damages my vehicle feels like a cover up. They sent me a letter saying how much it was sold for. They sold that vehicle for which was way below its value. They didnt try to get the face value of my vehicle. Which was a under miles brand new tires Hyundai Motor Finance company sold my car and didnt make an effort to sell my vehicle for fair market value. I want to know when and where & who has my vehicle. They are asking me to pay Which I know is incorrect. My property was damaged by them and the towing. They breached my peace so bad and leaving me and my family stranded in another state. That amount needs to be adjusted to cover the damage they caused. Heres a list of things they didnt do for me THE LAW SAYS, and I quote : the lender is legally required to send you a notice that includes important information before your car is sold. You also have the right to "" redeem '' your vehicle after it has been repossessed by paying the total remaining balance along with any repossession costs. However, you must exercise this right before the vehicle is sold They did NOT do any of these things so I could at least had a chance. As of right now cant afford to have a wage garnishment. Ive already took the first steps to filling bankruptcy. Also, and I quote : They must send you written notice prior to the sale stating : a description the vehicle that it is a sale that you are entitled to an accounting of the unpaid indebtedness and any charge for an accounting the time and place of a public disposition or the time after which another disposition is to be made any liability for a deficiency a telephone number to redeem collateral a phone number or mailing address from which more information about the sale is available NONE of this was done for me or too me. I feel like by them NOT doing these things They really didnt want me to have my vehicle back or work with me to give me a chance. This wasnt my first vehicle with this financial company. My first one ended with them due to the fact that I was reared with having that vehicle 7 months.

For the record, I NEVER applied for a Fleet Farm Visa Card issued by Synchrony. I did apply for the Fleet Farm in house credit card. On Saturday I approach the service desk and the WI, Fleet Farm store and asked if I applied for, and was approved for, Fleet Farms in house credit card, could I use it immediately to take advantage of some sales. I was advised that I could. I stated specifically that I did not want the bank card version, only the in house card. During the application process, the Fleet Farm associate taking my application said a pop up on her screen indicated that I should call Synchrony, which I did. A Synchrony representative said she would complete my application over the phone. I stated that was fine and again very specifically, with absolutely no ambiguity, stated I did not want the bank card version, only the in house card. After taking my information I was told I was approved with a {6 limit. I again asked if I could use the card immediately and was told, yes. I should ask the personal at the Fleet Farm customer service desk to print a temporary card. When requesting such a card from the service desk, two employees laughed and said thats not possible. They said Synchrony would have to supply the number. The laughter was because the very same thing had happened the day before. I called back Synchrony and was told I would have to wait 7 to 10 business days to get my card and Visa regulations prohibited giving out account numbers over the phone. When I protested that I didnt have a Visa card I was told, Yes you do. When I asked why my specified request for an in house only credit card was ignored, I was told because my credit was so good we issued the bank card! I then asked why I wasnt informed of this during the application process so I could have terminated the process immediately I was told that wasnt Synchronys policy. I was so incensed at Synchronys arrogance that I immediately canceled the card that technically I never applied for. Synchrony unscrupulously issued a card that I NEVER wanted nor knowingly applied for. Furthermore, Synchrony interfered with some last minute shopping with an in house Fleet Farm credit card which would have allowed me to take advantage of some corporate promotions. Even if I had waited for the bank card, I couldnt have taken advantage of Fleet Farms sales. This cost Feet Farm in the neighborhood of {6 - {7 in sales ; a fact that I let Fleet Farms corporate offices know. Today ) I received a letter from Synchrony informing me that since the information I supplied during my application for a Visa Card matches the credit bureaus, they are unable to pull the credit request from my file. This is more of Synchrony continuing with their unethical behavior. Ive had several calls with Synchrony detailing my situation and by now they know I never requested a bank card. Since all calls are recorded for accuracy, my statements would be easy to verify if one cared to know the truth. As an aside, one reason I dont want another bank card is I already have a half dozen or so and from the largest banks in the world among them etc. I do not need, nor want, another bank card! I am writing this letter to be included in my permanent file. Im also considering pursuing other avenues of redress. Certainly Congress with its respective House and Senate Banking committees should be made aware of Synchronys unscrupulous tactics. Increased oversight is definitely necessary.

I am writing to you regarding some substantial concerns I have uncovered during my thorough examination of the operations of Truist. As a conscientious consumer and advocate for ethical business practices, I believe it is crucial to bring these matters to your attention for immediate investigation and resolution. 1. Opting Out Violation ( 15 USC 6802-6805 ) : Upon reviewing the legal framework provided by 15 USC 6802-6805 , which empowers consumers to opt out of financial information sharing with institutions, I have observed potential instances where , and Truist might not be fully adhering to these statutory provisions. This has raised concerns about the protection of consumer privacy rights. It is my earnest request that your team conducts a comprehensive review and takes necessary steps to rectify any non-compliance issues promptly. 2. Credit Report Accuracy Infringement ( 15 USC 1681 ) : In the course of scrutinizing my credit report obtained from and , I have uncover discrepancies that may be in violation of 15 USC 1681. This crucial federal law mandates the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting, placing a responsibility on entities like Truis to conduct thorough investigations and promptly rectify any inaccuracies. Ensuring compliance with this law is vital for maintaining consumer trust and confidence. 3. CFPB Complaints Negligence : My investigation has brought to light a potential neglect in addressing and resolving complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Failure to actively engage with and resolve these complaints is a direct violation of CFPB regulations. I urge Truis to conduct an in-depth internal review, recognizing and rectifying any shortcomings in addressing outstanding complaints. This proactive approach is not only essential for regulatory compliance but also crucial for upholding the reputation of your organization. 4. Privacy Act of 1974 Non-Compliance ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) : Preliminary findings suggest a potential non-compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This federal legislation mandates precise management of personal information by government entities. Any deviation from its stipulations requires immediate attention. I strongly recommend that Truis initiates an immediate internal audit to ensure strict adherence to the Privacy Act. Proactive steps in this regard will not only align the organization with legal mandates but also enhance overall data protection measures. 5. General Redress and Compensation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n ) : The collective impact of these infringements has resulted in both quantifiable and intangible harm. In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681n, I formally demand Truist to provide due compensation for the distress and material losses borne as a direct consequence of these transgressions. This includes but is not limited to the time and effort expended in rectifying inaccuracies, emotional distress, and any financial repercussions suffered. To facilitate a fair and swift resolution, I kindly request a comprehensive response addressing each of the highlighted concerns within [ a reasonable timeframe, e.g. 30 days ]. I believe that your immediate attention to these matters will not only lead to a swift resolution but also uphold the integrity of legal mandates and safeguard the rights and interests of consumers.

I have never made a payment outside the grace period, so Truist has no legal basis to report me and is therefore making baseless threats and false statements. I just paid my mortgage on Friday I thought that by making a payment a little earlier ( although I have always paid within the grace period and I have every right to use every single day of that grace period ) that Truist would stop harassing me. Instead, Truist has emailed me three times this morning ( so far ) to falsely state that my mortgage payment hasnt been received. This is unnecessary harassment.

They broke the policy out to which is also called I initially had my loan through who sold the loan to PHH mortgage. It is an FHA loan that requires all insurance and taxes be paid out of escrow at closing. I paid a year and a half of insurance as well as money was taken out for my monthly mortgage payment in it appears my mortgage company did not pay the full premium. It was short {110 says it was charging {110 more for papers that I needed to sign that were not signed which would be impossible because I have a policy and went to closing. I never wouldve been able to close on the home if I hadnt sign for the policy, my closing was delayed and so according to the lady I spoke to they reissued me another policy with a different policy number, but did not explain to me. It was a whole different policy anyways, we wouldnt have been able to close without those signatures but we did when they found a mistake they added {110 to the premium to compensate for that, according to them PHH mortgage did not pay the so they canceled my insurance policy. According to PHH they never received notification of the additional amount. When they called to find out why the policy hit last and try to make payment for the {110 refused to accept the payment at that time. PHH needed to get their lawyers involved because this is a violation of RESPA. The law states that if mortgage company fails to pay escrow and the policy lapses or is expired it, is there a duty to call the insurance company and get the policy reinstated within 90 days. And the insurance company is supposed to reinstate the same policy within that 90 days, none of this happened instead they put the onus on me to purchase homeowners insurance that was twice three times the amount of my original policy. I called myself and they didnt mention any of the law and try to quote me a higher price as well. She asked if they could reinstated, and they said no, which was a lie and violation of RESPA. Whoevers fault it was whether it was the mortgage company or the insurance. They both are at fault because they did not follow the remedy. It is very clearly written. Neither company is returning my calls or taking this seriously and they are letting the 90 days go by. Also, the law states that if it was The mortgage companys fault for not paying the escrow, they are supposed to pay the additional amount for the next two years that my payment has gone up per month.

( 2 ) If an escrow account for the taxes or insurance premiums is deficient, the lender shall notify the property owner within 15 days after the lender receives the notification of taxes due from the county tax collector or receives the notification from the insurer that a premium is due.

( b ) If the lender violates paragraph ( a ) and the premium payment is not more than 90 days overdue, the insurer shall reinstate the insurance policy, retroactive to the date of cancellation, and the lender shall reimburse the property owner for any penalty or fees imposed by the insurer and paid by the property owner for purposes of reinstating the policy. ( c ) If the lender violates paragraph ( a ) and the premium payment is more than 90 days overdue or if the insurer refuses to reinstate the insurance policy, the lender shall pay the difference between the cost of the previous insurance policy and a new, comparable insurance policy for a period of 2 years.

I cancelled the card and got a new one. The charge on their system said TX, but I was told by the real that nothing the scammer told me was true, that their charges end with the reference code 660, that would never charge for a change they initiated, and I would have received an email with a receipt for the fee, none of which occurred. Three weeks later, on Citi Bank emailed me with the good news that my dispute had been resolved in my favor. Your {490 conditional credit is now permanent. There's nothing else you need to do. I was greatly relieved! For details, it said, please click here. I was curious to see how it got resolved so quickly. Generally, it takes up to 45 days at Citi, if the merchant doesnt reply, to get the dispute resolved. But there was no explanation, just dates. The next day, I got another email, saying Action Required! It said there was a message that might require my immediate attention! I looked in my account notifications and found only a blank page with a link in the middle that said in large letters Withdraw Dispute. I didnt understand. Why were they prompting me to withdraw a dispute with a scammer that was resolved in my favor, for which I was given a permanent credit? The only reason I could come up with, was it was a formality to finish the documentation, as when a complaint or bad review results in some compensation or explanation from a hotel or other business and they ask you to remove the complaint from the or review. Not suspecting anything, and given no warning or explanation, I clicked on the link, but immediately had doubts and called Citi customer service right away to see if that was a mistake. It was! I explained that I had no intention of reversing the dispute, and explained for the tenth time that it was a scammer, impersonating and there is no way I would want to give the money back to him. The friendly woman explained that yes that was a common mistake. but she would take care of it. The next day, I got another message, telling me that they had received my communication, stating I needed to reopen this dispute, but that the money had been returned to the merchant and there was unfortunately nothing else I could do! I was furious! Apparently, the woman with whom I spoke did not take care of it! I called Citi and complained and was told my complaint would be sent to Investigations but it would take approximately 10 days before I heard back. After waiting and worrying for 10 days, I finally got another message, saying that it was irreversible. Again, I called and asked to speak to a manager or someone with authority who could help me. The woman listened very patiently, but could only offer to send my complaint back to investigations again with another 10 day wait. After 10 days, I got another message that it was irreversible and threatening to report my account as past due to the credit bureaus, if I didnt pay the minimum due. I researched this online and found many people have had similar problems with Citi Bank. ( They have 1.6 out of 5 stars on ) My options are to file a complaint with the or file a suit in small Claims court, one requiring up-front payment of approximately {250 and both taking up to 6 months to conclude with an uncertain outcome.

I never signed nor received any type of acknowledgement receipt from a mailing service for any mail from this company. I am familiar with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Had I signed a receipt of notice for the proper and legal documentation from this company, I wouldve immediately responded asking for lawful verification of debt or copy of court ordered judgement well within the lawful 30 days allotted. After receiving my response letter with receipt, this company would have to legally cease from collection attempts and remove the account from my credit reports until their proof of verification is sent back to me. This company has reported to my credit reports without observing the FDCPA laws. My credit has been impacted adversely because of this companys irresponsibility. My credit reports also show that I.C. SYSTEM, INC has provided this alleged account with inaccurate information. The FCRA requires that all data reported from the credit reporting agencies, creditors, or furnishers on a consumer 's report be 1 % ACCURATE, 1 % VERIFIABLE, and 1 % TIMELY. This means no data can be reported that can't be legally PROVEN to be 1 % accurate.

Not only did this company not follow lawful FDCPA communications protocol, but it has also broken FDCPA False or Misleading Representations protocol as well. A debt collector, in collecting a debt, may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation. Specifically, a debt collector may not falsely represent the character, amount, or legal status of the debt, or of any services rendered, or compensation he or she may receive for collecting the debt. A debt collector may not communicate, or threaten to communicate, false credit information or information that should be known to be false, including not identifying disputed debts as such. Each of my 3 credit reports show different information instead of them all showing the exact same information. This is considered a false and misleading representation that this company has submitted to the credit reporting agencies. Please remove this account from my credit reports immediately. It is not my duty to provide evidence that this alleged debt is not mine. It is the obligation of the debt collector to provide evidence that they can lawfully collect on any alleged debt, accurately report to the credit agencies, and follow all FCRA and FDCPA laws.

It would also appear that Experian continues to initiate disputes on behalf of consumers not only without their knowledge or consent but even against the consumers demand Experian not do so. Experian 's obligations are not limited to Section 611 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In fact Section 611 ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( A ) has no relevance to the matter of concern, as it pertains to "" Frivolous Disputes '' and the present pertains to information that has been reported to be the result of identity theft. Section 605B is the appropriate portion of the FCRA which outlines Experian 's duties, which include "" ( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days . '' This matter was first brought to Experian 's attention on thus it had until at the very latest to block the information and it did not and still has not. This means that each and every day from through today and continuing until Experian fulfills its legal obligation, it has and will continue to cause me to suffer irreparable harm, including but not limited to severe injuries to my mental and emotional health, extreme and undue hardship including causing me to become homeless since you have been informing prospective landlords and creditors that I am a substantial risk, when I am not, and obstruction of my businesses ability to gain the credit needed to sustain.

When I get behind the wheel of a vehicle, my ignorance of a traffic law doesn't make me not guilty when I get ticketed and found guilty of violating said law, because I have an obligation to understand all that is legally required of me before I can drive.

Upon exiting their car, we offered to pay in cash, but the driver said he would NOT accept cash. I gave him my credit card, and he ran it through a device attached to his cell phone. It was raining slightly, so he held it up under his open trunk lid, so I could not see the amount he was entering, claiming that he didnt want to get his phone wet.

We checked the American Airlines/Barclays card , and there was also a {21 charge on that account for the taxi ride. We immediately called the dispute line and asked for a denial of the charge. I was told that the charge could not be denied and that it had to be posted before it could be disputed. I then asked for a freeze to be applied to our account so that the fraudulent taxi driver would not receive this outrageous amount. We have since tried to dispute this charge, but the name under which the men were operating has no contact information.

I've been reviewing my credit report and came across some information that raised a few questions. In my exploration, I delved into the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 USC 1681, section 602, which highlights the need for consumer reporting agencies to exercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for consumers ' right to privacy. As a consumer, I've been thinking about my rights and responsibilities in this context. According to 15 USC 6801, it is the policy of Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and protect the security and confidentiality of their nonpublic personal information. Digging deeper, I found 15 USC 1681, section 604, which outlines the circumstances under which a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report. It explicitly mentions that they can do so only in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I want to emphasize that I haven't given any written consent for the sharing of my information, and this concerns me. Furthermore, 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) notes that a financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a non-affiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how they can exercise the nondisclosure option. To my knowledge, I have not been informed of such an option. I also stumbled upon 15 USC 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) which states that no consumer reporting agency may make a consumer report containing adverse information without authorization. It appears that an adverse item is being reported without my permission, which, according to 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A, is against the law. The Act further mandates that consumer reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of the statute. Unfortunately, it seems that and may not be following these guidelines, as indicated in 15 U.S. Code 1681e. Lastly, I discovered in 12 CFR 1016.7 that a consumer has the right to opt out of reporting services at any time. I'm choosing to exercise that right. I wanted to bring these specific sections of the Act to your attention and discuss how we can address these concerns. Your insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

[ # 3 ] Furthermore, due to being a long term victim of identity theft, I informed the CRAS that I was concerned with my privacy being violated, and specifically referred them to 15 U.S. Code 6801, which states that I am supposed to be 1 % "" protected from having my nonpublic private information being shared. This federal law specifically states that ( 1 ) it is the policy of the CONGRESS that EACH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers, ( 2 ) to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information, ( 3 ) to protect the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, ( 4 ) to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records ; and lastly, ( 5 ) to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Also according to this law, I also informed The CRAS that I was never provided with the opportunity or choice to opt out. By continuing to report this information, it keeps me at risk. ( # 4 ) In addition to # 3, I informed The CRAS that they are in violation of U.S. Code 6802 which speaks on obligations with respect to disclosures of personal information. This law specifically states the following : that A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION may NOT, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated party [ ie : Transunion ] ANY NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION, unless such financial institution provides or has "" provided to the consumer a notice that complies with section 6803 of this title [ I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ]. This LAW goes on to state that, In general, A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION may NOT disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party [ ie : Transunion unless A ) such FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSES TO THE CONSUMER, in writing or in electronic form, that such information may be disclosed to such third party ; [ I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS DISCLOSURES OF ANY KIND. ] ( B ) the consumer is given the opportunity, before the time that such information is initially disclosed, to direct that such information not be disclosed to such third party [ WAS NEVER GIVEN SUCH OPPORTUNITY OR NOTICE ] ; and ( C ) the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option, [ I WAS NOT GIVENY ANY EXPLANATIONS OF ANY KIND, NOR OPTIONS TO EXERCISE ; ( D ) with the consent or at the direction of the consumer ; [ I DID NOT PROVIDE CONSENT OF ANY KIND ]. You can find more about this here : 15 U.S. Code 6801, in both sections A and B, which are also being violated. ( # 5 ) I then went on to explain to The CRAS that TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION, OR EXPERIENCES, between the CONSUMER AND THE FURNISHER are to EXCLUDED FROM CONSUMER REPORTING per federal law -15 U.S. Code ( 2 ) Even by THE CRAS being made aware of this, they still REFUSE to remove any of the disputed information, and have not provided me with ANY physical documentation ( # 6 ) It is really unsetting that I am having this experience with the CRA 's because according to 15 U.S. Code 1681 further findings by CONGRESS, pertaining to the ACCURACY AND FAIRNESS of credit reporting states that, ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. INACCURATE CREDIT REPORTS DIRECTLY IMPAIR THE EFFICIENCY OF THE BANKING SYSTEM, AND UNFAIR CREDIT REPORTING METHODS UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO THE CONTINUED FUNCTIONING OF THE BANKING SYSTEM. ( 2 ) An ELABORATE MECHANISM has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, CHARACTER, AND GENERAL REPUTATION OF CONSUMERS. ( 3 ) CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES have ASSUMED A VITAL ROLE in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers. ( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their GRAVE RESPONSIBILITIES with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. It is the purpose of this subchapter to REQUIRE that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is FAIR AND EQUITABLE TO THE CONSUMER, WITH REGARD to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter. For further context, please see 15 U.S. Code 1681a - Definitions ; rules of construction to define and make clear distinction of various words being used in the laws. Lastly, although both companies and have agreed to remove its respective account from my credit report, neither have provided any methods of verifications which I have previously requested on many occasions. Per my right under 15 U.S.C. 1681g, I requested full validation from and which I have not received. I asked them to disclose all of the documents that they have recorded and or retained at the time of my dispute, and nothing was sent to me, therefore should be DELETED IMMEDIATELY under Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ( i ) These companies are also not METRO2 compliant! Lastly, I do not appreciate how my character, reputation, and credit worthiness, are being damaged by the day, as long as these inaccurate, unverified, and fraudulent items continue reporting on my credit report. At this point, depending on the results of this dispute, I am willing to seek relief from the year when I first disputed, until now, and I am STILL unable to obtain financing due to these matters.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,300XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-01-03,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,8089747,2024,1,3

Got appointment confirmation email for at I reached on time and this time after waiting for around minutes, same gentleman with beard reached me. After looking at my document, he made the same excuse that he needs to check with his manager. It was the same person I met on also. Manager was also the same Now they started making the excuses : excuse - as you are changing the bank account to -we can't notarize. If you were changing it to Wells Fargo account we could have done that. I was shocked to hear this as this manager was exactly doing the same thing to promote Wells Fargo and compelling a customer to change it to Wells Fargo account. I simply told him please show me your terms and conditions or rule book and give me this in writing. He made another excuse that printer is not working. I pointed to the white printer which somebody just took the printout while I was waiting in the lobby. excuse - This document required medallion kind of seal and notary that we don't do that. Please get it from public notary like I told that treasury department has clearly specified notary from bank and not public notary. He said how he can verify my account? I offered him my phone with Now played another dirty trick that he can't do this. I said- please provide me your rule book as within last 5 months - I am facing this adverse action. He was not willing to do that. Now i asked where it the supervisor. He said nobody above him in this branch. He can write a complaint to team. I said I want to write that complaint right being in the branch. He said he can't let me do that. I said let me write on plain paper and send it to that team-for which he refused. In the meanwhile started creating online complaint on his computer which as blocking screen so that nobody can see it. I said why can't you print it using browser print functionality- he said I can not let Wells Fargo proprietary data to go outside of bank. I said let me read on the print out and then you can shred it- he refused that also. While i was there, his subordinate was trying to come up with more excuses why they can not do notary. I called Wells Fargo from that branch and spent minutes to get that complaint done. This is discrimination - the moment this sees an like me- starts retaliating I asked the lady on the phone to share with me all the terms and conditions document regarding Wells Fargo in terms of what they can notarize and what they can't? Also why this branch didn't called me to send my paperwork by email before the appointment? They could have saved my trip plus hours on While i was talking to Wells Fargo customer service- this disrespectful and unapologetic asked me to leave the branch by saying - goodbye even when I was sitting quietly and talking to them over the phone Here are the contents of CFPB Complaint Dated - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - I have wells Fargo Business checking account, personal checking account and Wells Fargo credit cards.

Upon checking my documents, he told me that it can not be notarized. I asked why? He said that it will be conflict of interest for Wells fargo to notarize the documents as it was a Complaint to He said as this could be sent to court that's why he is not notarizing. He called in his manager He told me the same reason - I provided my reasoning that notary just says that I am the one who is signing in front of authorized notary and nothing more than that. Moreover by looking all over the documents and copying them ( you are violating the very confidentiality of the documents ) I told him that during and - I got one charge being notarized in the same wells Fargo branch and currently it's a lawsuit in court said that i was not the at that time. Another issue - this wells fargo keep on changing so rules keep on changing stated that I can go to and get it notarized. I told him that charges {6 for the very first page- it's just page but both didn't budge. I said that i want to make a complaint. From till the complaint and didn't showed mem what he has written ( that means - his own version which may be totally biased ) Last name means somebody from folks just hate so that might also have played in here tried to stereo type me further that if there are some lease documents then they could have notarized. I simply told him that what if the tenant and landlord has any fights and then go to court. In that case that notarized document is also some court document. Moreover, just because I am an origin person doesn't mean that I am immigrant and always going to live in apartment - that's a totally bad analogy with bad taste in my mouth. I was very clear that both and are making up the rules on the fly and definitely not convincing minutes for complaint filing and not sharing with me the contents of the complaint is definitely not transparent. Moreover, this is a second time- this particular Wells Fargo denied notarizing the document - I end up going to and pay them {6 this time. When one makes the online appointment- they clearly select the reason - notary - why this Wells Fargo scheduler doesn't tell them what they can notarize or not? this way - customers don't have to waste time and money.

This complaint is about a branch manager. I AM REFILING MY COMPLAINT AGAINST A BRANCH MANAGER BECAUSE TILL NOW I DID NOT RECEIVE ANSWERS TO MY 7 QUESTIONS IN THE COMPLAINT. This complaint is ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE, against the same branch manager and AGAIN Wells Fargo failed to respond PROPERLY, HONESTLY AND CLEARLY TO MY COMPLAINT AGAINST the BRANCH MANAGER WELLS FARGO 's ECMOs lack of responsibility and lack of knowledge on how to deal with such issue is demonstrated by the response provided Wells Fargo here. The Wells Fargo employees who are answering the complaint are working from the comfort of their home without any control from a Wells Fargo management and without any supervision and the response of Wells Fargo here is null and demonstrates the nun professionalism of the Wells Fargo ECMO employees and their disrespect to the customers and to the CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION DEPARTMENT. For that I re-filed a new complaint here hoping that Wells Fargo will open their eyes and ear to my complaint and do the necessary investigation and answer the questions in this complaint properly. and not telling me the answers to your question is a secret we can not share it with you and so is the invisible investigation. AND MY RESPONDING THAT THE BRANCH MANAGER CAN NOT ORDER AN ATM CARD AND CAN NOT INFORM THE CUSTOMERS THAT THEY CAN ORDER THE ATM CARD BY PHONE AND ONLINE! Did the ECMO STILL REFUSING TO PROVIDE THE ANSWERS. Here is my complaint at was the first time I entered a Wells Fargo branch since At my visit to branch in CA, I was the only customer at the branch. I found out that my ATM card was expired, I requested from the teller employee at the window to order my replacement ATM card, the employee requested help from the BRANCH MANAGER, who, after looking at my account, told me that he can not order the ATM card from his computer and that in order for me to order a new card, I MUST MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND SIT WITH A BANKER. He then proceeded to tell me that no appointments are available soon, but he can put me on a waiting list and get me to meet a banker faster than making an appointment. which I found it ODD because I have been with Wells Fargo for more than 35 years and I have renewed my ATM cards before at the teller window. Usually, they want you to sit with a banker to try to convince you to open more accounts that you do not need and to make investments that profit the bankers. I want from Wells Fargo answers to my questions, to verify if Wells Fargo is turning to a circus or is it still a financial institution 1- WHY THE MANAGER AT THE BRANCH TOLD ME THAT I NEED AN APPOINTMENT TO SIT WITH A BANKER JUST TO RENEW MY ATM CARD? It must be a hidden reason behind it that benefits the banker. 2- DOES THIS MANAGER THINK I AM TO TELL ME THAT HE CAN NOT RENEW MY ATM CARD ON HIS COMPUTER? 3- HOW COME WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE OF THE BRANCH AND CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE , THE CUSTOMER SERVICE RENEWED MY CARD IN 30 SECOND PHONE CALL? 4- WHY DOES THE MANAGER OF THE BRANCH DOES NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE AND DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO RENEW AN ATM CARD? 5- WHY DID THIS BRANCH MANAGER NOT TELL ME THAT I CAN ORDER THE REPLACEMENT ATM CARD ONLINE AND OVER THE PHONE? 6- IS WELLS FARGO HIRING MANAGERS FOR THE BRANCHES WITH NO EXPERIENCE SIMILAR TO THE ONES WHO ANSWER MY COMPLAINT AND THE ONE WHO TOLD ME HE CAN NOT RENEW MY ATM CARD ON HIS COMPUTER? 7- WHY IS WELLS FARGO IS REFUSING TO INVESTIGATE THIS POSSIBLE MISCONDUCT? I am not getting answers to my questions even after re-submitting my complaint more than 25 times in the last 8 months because Wells Fargo contracted the customer service duty to a company called ( ECMO ) This company labeled the employees The employees are without any banking experience to resolve the customer 's issues, those employees are labeled are Working from the comfort of their homes without any supervision and NOT under the Wells Fargo management they are independent contractors. their responses are just a copy and paste of generic replies that they send to everyone or a vague response as the response I received from the working from the comfort of their home Refused to address my complaint properly and they switch the case from a case against the MANAGER to a case against the window teller employee or about opening a new account or about checking and saving or about lack of appointments which I am not complaining about. Those Employees of the contractors refused to forward my complaint to a REAL Wells Fargo manager, and refused to answer and investigate my complaint. I was told in writing by the Wells Fargo 's contractors that Wells Fargo has no email or website for online complaints and has no managers or supervisors and that was confirmed by the last response of the as they think they are the highest level in Wells Fargo, or they are the ay Wells Fargo and no managers above them. So, the Customers like me find no Wells Fargo site to complain but here. Notice : because in my experience, Wells Fargo Employees do not tell the truth. You can review the security cameras at the branch to verify that the branch was empty of customers except myself and 4 tellers at the windows had nothing to do and the manager was telling jokes to the employees at What do you expect from this bank who does not even have an email address for their customer service in this I WANT THIS COMPLAINT TO BE FORWARDED TO A REAL WELLS FARGO MANAGER AND NOT TO THE CLOWNS LABELED NOTICE : NO PHONE CALLS ARE ACCEPTED ALL RESPONSES MUST BE IN WRITING EMAILS OR MAIL BECAUSE IN MY EXPERIENCE, THE WELLS FARGO EMPLOYEES DO NOT TELL THE TRUTH.

I am writing to you regarding some substantial concerns I have uncovered during my thorough examination of the operations of As a conscientious consumer and advocate for ethical business practices, I believe it is crucial to bring these matters to your attention for immediate investigation and resolution Opting Out Violation ( 15 USC 6802-6805 ) : Upon reviewing the legal framework provided by 15 USC 6802-6805 , which empowers consumers to opt out of financial information sharing with institutions, I have observed potential instances where California might not be fully adhering to these statutory provisions. This has raised concerns about the protection of consumer privacy rights. It is my request that your team conducts a comprehensive review and takes necessary steps to rectify any non-compliance issues promptly Credit Report Accuracy Infringement ( 15 USC 1681 ) : In the course of scrutinizing my credit report obtained from I have uncover discrepancies that may be in violation of 15 USC 1681. This crucial federal law mandates the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting, placing a responsibility on entities like to conduct thorough investigations and promptly rectify any inaccuracies. Ensuring compliance with this law is vital for maintaining consumer trust and confidence CFPB Complaints Negligence : My investigation has brought to light a potential neglect in addressing and resolving complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Failure to actively engage with and resolve these complaints is a direct violation of CFPB regulations. I urge California to conduct an in-depth internal review, recognizing and rectifying any shortcomings in addressing outstanding complaints. This proactive approach is not only essential for regulatory compliance but also crucial for upholding the reputation of your organization Privacy Act of 1974 Non-Compliance ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) : Preliminary findings suggest a potential non-compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This federal legislation mandates precise management of personal information by government entities. Any deviation from its stipulations requires immediate attention. I strongly recommend that california initiates an immediate internal audit to ensure strict adherence to the Privacy Act. Proactive steps in this regard will not only align the organization with legal mandates but also enhance overall data protection measures General Redress and Compensation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n ) : The collective impact of these infringements has resulted in both quantifiable and intangible harm. In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681n, I formally demand to provide due compensation for the distress and material losses borne as a direct consequence of these transgressions. This includes but is not limited to the time and effort expended in rectifying inaccuracies, emotional distress, and any financial repercussions suffered.

This caused the account to go negative however I was unaware that this had happened. I received a letter in the mail on on informing me that my account had been overdraw for over 45 days and was closed and reported to The following morning I called them immediately and asked first what was needed from me, second where the funds were drawn from and third why I was just not being informed when they had my phone number, my e-mail, and my address. They said they needed the money paid and that it was reported to and they could not affect it anymore until the money was paid. In response to the other questions they said they had advised me via mail, when I informed them I was not advised as I did not ever receive any mail with any advisement to them they claims well, then you would have to take that up with usps and tried to claim that since I had gotten one letter although i received it over 30 days late in my mail box, that therefore the mail service was working and I was indeed advised of the situation. This I found quite curous as they were trying to claim a letter I did not receive was an advisement that took place. Dropping that matter for now I continued to dig in a similar statement to the following. "" Well, you had my e-mail and phone number, why did you not first attempt to call or e-mail me. Additionally why was there no delivery confirmation, tracking number, or signature requested on this supposed advisement from you. '' The representatives response was that they could not be bothered. I find it shockingly damaging and predatory to close someones account and send reports to a consumer reporting agency without "" being bothered '' to call the members known phone number, nor e-mail them, nor indeed even verify they have received your supposed advisements via putting tracking or delivery confirmation or requiring a signature for delivery of those supposed advisements. They took a damaging act and attacked my consumer report because they simply could not be bothered to use any of the several up to date confirmed communication paths that were open to them. Additionally they initially refused to give me the number to chex systems stating that I could simply it. '' After calling and finding out why they attempted to draw funds without my knowledge and fixing that issue, as well as immediately going to my current bank and wiring the negative balance to the account I additionally asked how i can protect my consumer report and they said there was nothing they could do and it was "" int the queue to clear ''. I pried the number for out of them and was advised it may take 7 days for things to show. After 7 days I contacted to contest and press the issue. Unfortunately they claimed they would need my full first and last name, social security number, date and place of birth, as well as the past 5 years of living addresses in-order to proceed. I asked whether they were a government agency and they said no they were not. I said there is no way your getting all that information out of me and they said "" ok . ''. So. now I turn to you cfpb. This should be criminal behavior. They had my number, they had my e-mail, they had my address.

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC 1681a Definitions : Rules of Construction ( 2 ) ( a ) ( i ) States the term consumer report does not include any report containing information solely as to transactions or experience between the consumer and the person making the report. Late payments are a form of transactions and utilization is an experience created by credit usage. The companies below are reporting payments on multiple accounts ( accounts listed below ) and/ or utilization is an experience created by credit usage. 15 USC 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) states any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other, in accordance with the consumer to whom it relates. I never gave the companies below written instructions to report anything to my consumer report, let alone these payments/utilizations. I sent a letter letting them know that I opted out of their reporting. Also, according to 15 USC 1681 602 congressional findings and statement of purpose states, there is need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. It also states the banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting method undermined the public confidence with is essential to the continuous function of the banking system. The reporting of these payments to my consumer report are not accurate and my privacy has been violated due to the companies listed below Reporting Services is a witness to multiple violations of 15 USC 1681. They have a report of every transaction from every bank since opening a bank account. I opted out of all consent to disclose my personal information to all of the users who supplied it to their affiliates. I will attach a copy of one of the letters sent to all of my credit users. The terms and conditions of the banks that I have banked with show on their form at the SEC that they are in compliance to 15 USC 6805 and my ability to opt out of them sharing my information. I have reached out and exclaimed this over the years with little to no results. For the collection agencies that claim that I owe them a debt that has been sold to them is also invalid because its considered a charge off which is defined as income according to the IRS. The original contract with the agency that sold the debt charged off the debt with the IRS and now that debt is considered income. The Privacy Act of 1974 says : 1. 5 U.S.C. 552a ( b ) ( 1 ) - Need to Know within Agency No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains unless the disclosure would be The Inquiries listed on my credit profile are also a violation to the privacy act of 1974 and 15 USC1681 ( C ) any report in which a person who has been requested by a third party to make a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly to a consumer conveys his or her decision with respect to such request, if the third party advises the consumer of the name and address of the person to whom the request was made, and such person makes the disclosures to the consumer required under section 1681 of this title ; All of the inquiries and any reports stating payments were late should be removed. All payments were made on time using securities. A Forensic Financial audit would clearly show none of the payments were late, therefore ; All of my accounts should show positive payment history.

This in addition to my regular principal and interest of {1 would be {16 On I emailed Freedom Mortgage Customer Service as well as the and requested information on my escrow. I asked that they advise how they calculated the shortage and spread, as well as why my escrow indicated a balance of {2 when I paid which included {4 to escrow. I also asked why Mortgage indicated an escrow balance transfer of {390 to Freedom Mortgage and why it was not also reflected in the escrow balance. I indicated even if Freedom did a reversal of the initial transfer of {390 back to it should not have come from {4 I remitted for I requested they rectify all discrepancy in the initial analysis and send a new escrow analysis to me by On a representative from Freedom called me and began to detail how the costs were calculated. In multiple instances that representative provided incorrect calculations. I informed him my annual homeowners insurance was changed to a new carrier effective and was over {5 cheaper so their calculation was incorrect. I requested he email or mail me a breakdown of all escrow figures, including detailed breakdown of shortage and required minimum escrow balance. He agreed he would but that has not been done. On I receive an email from Freedom Mortgage that was attempted to be recalled. It was a duplication of the exact same initial escrow analysis ; however, they were sure to note it would be advisable for me to remit any homeowners premium refund received from the prior carrier to Freedom Mortgage to replenish my escrow account. This is misleading since their policy indicates ) any additional escrow paid in will not reduce mortgage payment billed amount back to what it was and ) any attempt to pay escrow shortage in full would not reduce mortgage payment back to what it was. This policy is also in conflict with their analysis which indicates specific mortgage payment amounts based on how much is paid back into escrow. On I emailed Freedom Mortgage Team and to remind them I had not received the info previously requested. I let them know that upon logging in to make my mortgage payment, I saw a new Escrow Analysis reflecting a shortage now of {23 vs. initial {11 In addition, the new mortgage premium billed for was now {15 vs. {16 I explained I was confused as to the new escrow shortage, required minimum due and spread calculations. I also question how a higher escrow shortage can equate to a lower monthly mortgage payment. I informed them at that point their company was simply throwing out random calculations with no transparent accounting to justify their analysis and billing. I again requested the same info- a detailed breakdown of the escrow shortage and required minimum calculations but this time for both the initial and revised analysis. I requested a detailed accounting of the {390 escrow discrepancy from the payment remitted. I also requested they reflect all escrow payment detail from the prior mortgage holder on their analysis as is incorrectly reflects no payments for all of I purchased my home in and have made payments in advance since acquiring my loan and have never been late. My initial mortgage was with They transferred it to Mortgage in and Mortgage transferred it Freedom Mortgage in It is my opinion, Freedom Mortgage is intentionally acquiring specific loans based on specific demographic in order to manipulate the accounting and raise escrow thereby raising mortgage payments and ultimately forcing individuals to default on their loans. Given my loan is now at ( purchased at ) and my home value is estimated at there is a significant amount of equity. Given my loan was issued with a interest rate, and that interest rate is nowhere to be found in the current U.S. economic environment, Freedom Mortgage and know it's unlikely a customer would refinance their mortgage loan. In addition, since the loan is FHA, and FHA changed the rules requiring homeowners under FHA to maintain escrow with the mortgage holder, it permits predatory lenders and bad actors like Freedom Mortgage to continue intentionally cause customers to default. Freedom Mortgage, along with partner companies in crime like Mortgage and some other non-bank lenders, are leveraging loopholes in FHA mortgage loan requirements and other loan types to cause intentional financial hardship, default and foreclosures to customers in order to obtain and sell the property for themselves.

Citi can not just falsely close someones accounts and ruin their life when they are the ones who reach out to make sure. I am a human being and this is someones life. I have been extremely patient and spent so much time but this is not a decision I will accept as 1. It is false and 2. It negatively affects my life. 3. Even the credit line management team acknowledged it was an error and verified indeed I called multiple time to get the disputes cancelled and make my account secure but indeed employees did not follow through. They said that in order to get the security risk removed and my Citibank credit cards reopened would be through you since they already handed it ofer to the executive response team.Please see important points below and please get my Citibank Credit Cards Reopened as soon as possible and this errored security risk flag removed as well. Thank you.1. I used the charges specifically for Citibank as I get rewards from either the merchant or the bank for certain stores.2. I personally inquired on why the charges were gone as some purchases just got bounced back and I was either not getting my stuff in the mail or services and subscriptions getting cancelled.3. I am obviously an exemplary customer per one of your bankers due to my perfect payment history paying ahead of time and more than my full balance ( not even just the minimum payment )4. I was patient and took all the steps to get Citibanks error fixed and account reopened but no one is listening to me. Its as if they do not want to waste their time. For example the representative started the investigation in the evening and gave me a false generic response She promised she will due her due diligence to help me but she did not.5. Obviously my relationship has been great up until this error by Citibank due to your customer service or dispute team who did not follow through anything. My mistake for not documenting or getting reference numbers but of course that should still be on the representatives fault.6. Instead of doing an internal root cause analysis for your company, you are closing someones accounts in error.7. I specifically requested time and time again that if these are all online like you claim then remove this feature. However no one is willing to work with me.8. I placed additional security on my phone, social, two factor authentications, and others and yet still no one is willing to work with me despite my over decade relationship with Citi that was positive until this errored incident by one of your team members or departments.9. Time and time again multiple representstives have confirmed that I requested any disputes that were placed on my account be cancelled. Some maybe misheard me while others maybe heard me and did not follow through.10. I have been very kind and patient this far but most people I spoke to were very short and slight me which I find unprofessional. Moreover they are giving me things from that were resolved unrelated to anything else and again notes that there was an error.11. Instead of being rewarded for reaching out to clarify the charges aside from are mine, you are ruining my life to avoid doing a root cause analysis for your company.12. I spent so much time and money including getting postage stamps and sending multiple letters, multiple emails, multiple phone calls, and multiple outreaches, yet no one is helping me.13. Like I mentioned time and time again that I am willing to work with Citibank to have additional security measures more than I already have added that I mentioned to ensure the security of my account.14. I have a longstanding relationship with Citibank and I am disheartened by this false error. This should not have happened. 15. You are sending me something from that was also an error removed and this obviously is unrelated to the mistake you made this year Even the credit line management team acknowledged it was an error and verified indeed I called multiple time to get the disputes cancelled and make my account secure but indeed employees did not follow through. They said that in order to get the security risk removed and my Citibank credit cards reopened would be through you since they already handed it ofer to the executive response team.17.

I recently purchased a new construction condo unit within a community consisting of units. The community has a master parcel for tax purposes, and each unit is responsible for reimbursing their portion of the quarterly tax bill. For the 2024 real estate tax, the total bill for all units in the community was {99 and my specific portion amounted to {210 Unfortunately, there has been a significant error in the payment allocation process by ServiceMac, my mortgage company. Instead of deducting the correct amount related to my unit 's tax responsibility, they erroneously paid the entire {99 from my escrow account, which pertains to the master parcel and not my individual unit. I have made numerous attempts to contact ServiceMac to rectify this error, but unfortunately, their response has been unsatisfactory, and I am yet to receive a resolution. This situation has caused undue financial strain as the incorrect payment has not been refunded to my account. Despite multiple attempts to contact ServiceMac, there has been no meaningful action on their part. Their response has been inadequate, and they insist that it was not their fault. Furthermore, they have indicated that the resolution process may take up to three months after a thorough review and verification, a timeline that is wholly unacceptable given the urgency and nature of the issue. I request your intervention in addressing this matter promptly. I am seeking the following resolutions : 1. Immediate refund of the overpaid amount of {99 to my escrow account.2. Clarification and correction of the payment allocation process to ensure such errors do not occur in the future.3. Compensation for any associated fees or charges incurred due to this error.

35641,218578,2024-01-04,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I purchased my home 17 years ago with a first and second mortgage. The original lender ( owned in turn by ) was known for making subprime mortgages and engaging in predatory servicing of its loans whereby it would, for example, fail to provide borrowers with timely or clear information about payment due dates and amounts owed. The second mortgage had an original loan amount of {19 but only {27 of that amount was scheduled to be paid over the loan term, with a remaining a balloon payment of {17 due at the end of the loan. Thus, if I was unable to refinance 15 years after the loan was made, the loan was built to maximize the risk of foreclosure. In during the economic downturn, I experienced financial hardship and became rendering me unable to work. I entered bankruptcy. When I received a discharge in my bankruptcy later that year later, I mistakenly understood that the second mortgage debt had been eliminated as a lien on my home. After my exit from bankruptcy in I did not receive any mortgage statements or other correspondence from the servicer, Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) or any other source about the second mortgage until I received a debt verification notice from a law firm ) in ( During the same time period, I continued to receive payment invoices for the first mortgage on my home and am current on the payments. ) The lack of any correspondence about the second mortgage from until reinforced my mistaken understanding that the second mortgage was no longer a valid lien on my home following my bankruptcy discharge. I disputed this second mortgage and requested verification of the debt from on or about but I did not receive any response until when I received notice from that my home would be sold in foreclosure on At this time I retained Legal Aid as counsel for help. In early I communicated telephonically with SLS to ask if loss mitigation was available. I was chastised by a representative who told me that although I thought [ I ] would get away with not paying [ my ] debts, now I would lose my home. The representative eventually agreed to submit a request for loss mitigation and told me that this would pause the foreclosure process subsequently confirmed to my counsel that the foreclosure sale had been canceled. A payoff statement from states that, in addition to a principal balance of {19 SLS and the owner of the debt '' ) are also demanding payment of more than {33 in interest and fees, with interest accruing at the rate of 11.6 % for the past 12 years, most of which time I was not receiving any correspondence at all about the loan. I have attached a copy of the payoff statement as Exhibit A. On my counsel sent a Qualified Written Request ( "" QWR '' ) under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( "" RESPA '' ) to SLS ( attached as Exhibit B ) and a demand letter to MRLP ( Exhibit C ) Specific deficiencies identified in the QWR include : *Improper charging of interest for time periods when no periodic mortgage statements or other required notices were being sent concerning the loan. * SLS and are not entitled to retroactively demand strict compliance on the payment terms for periods of time when no lender or servicer was communicating with me about the loan. Under Georgia law, O.C.G.A. 13-4-23, where, as here, the nonperformance of a party to a contract is caused by the conduct of the opposite party, such conduct shall excuse the other party from performance. Because no correspondence was being provided to me to notify me as to where payments should be sent or the amount of the payment, this conduct caused me not to be able to make payments on the loan, or pursue other options I might have had with regard to the loan, and excuses me from performance on the loan during such time period. Following a mutual departure from the contract such as this, SLS and may now demand payments going forward, but are not entitled to interest and fees retroactively during the extended period when no statements or correspondence were being sent. Furthermore, the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) and RESPA impose requirements and standards that investors and servicers must follow in providing required notices to mortgage borrowers. These requirements were not met in the handling of my account. TILA places an affirmative duty on the creditor, assignee, or servicer of a residential mortgage loan to provide periodic statements to the borrower, for each billing cycle, containing specified, detailed information regarding amounts owing under the mortgage loan. There is an exemption from the periodic statement requirement for loans that have been charged off, provided that no additional fees or interest will be charged on the account. I did not receive a periodic statement for my second mortgage loan from either the creditor, assignee, or servicer of the loan, for an approximately time period, and it was impermissible for any interest or fees to be charged during that time. When a loan is sold, assigned, or transferred, TILA also requires that the new owner of the loan provide notice to the borrower within 30 days of the assignment. Similarly, when the servicing of a mortgage loan is transferred, RESPA requires that the transferor and transferee servicers must each send notice at least 15 days before and no more than 15 days after the servicing transfer, respectively. I never received any such transfer of ownership notices concerning the second mortgage. I did not know where the loan had gone or where I should be sending payments. For violations of TILA and RESPA a borrower is entitled to recover actual damages, statutory damages, and attorneys fees. My actual damages include the accrued interest and fees I am now being charged for the extended time period when neither the lender ( s ) nor the servicer ( s ) of my second mortgage loan sent statements or notices despite being required to do so under federal law. My damages also include significant emotional distress from suddenly receiving a notice and payoff demand for over {33 in retroactive interest and fees, after having received no correspondence about the loan for such an extended period of time, and then being scheduled for foreclosure of my home and loss of my equity in order to collect on the over-inflated balance being claimed. *False, deceptive, and misleading representations in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act* The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) prohibits a debt collector from using any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of a debt. To the extent that SLS is a debt collector under the FDCPA, asserting that accrued interest is owed for a 12 year time period when neither the servicer ( s ) nor lender ( s ) were sending statements or notices to me, in violation of the express requirements of TILA and RESPA, is an inherently deceptive and misleading representation that violates both the general standard of FDCPA and also a specific provision prohibiting the use of deceptive means to attempt to collect a debt. SLS may be liable to me for actual and statutory damages, as well as attorneys fees, for these violations of the FDCPA. I disputed this second mortgage and requested verification of the debt from MRLP on or about but I did not receive any response other than a foreclosure notice. The FDCPA requires that SLS cease all collection activity until written verification of the debt has been provided to me. A foreclosure sale can not proceed prior to sufficient written verification being provided ( including the documents requested in the QWR ) *Violation of the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act* The conduct by SLS and described above is both unfair and deceptive. Attempting to collect interest and fees for a period of at least 12 years when I did not receive any periodic mortgage statement from either the servicer or lender for my second mortgage loan, nor any other communication from the servicer or lender of my loan, is inherently both unfair and deceptive. Had I been provided with periodic statements and notices for my second mortgage loan during that timeframe, I could have made monthly payments on my second mortgage loan as those payments came due, pursued loss mitigation, or otherwise pursued legal rights concerning the account, and I would not now be faced with an asserted total payoff of over {53 on an actual principal balance of {19 SLS and GHICs unfair and deceptive conduct entitles me to seek actual damages, treble damages, and attorneys fees under the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Specialized Loan Servicing Holdings LLC,GA,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-01-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8109793,2024,1,4

4221,101612,2024-01-26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"My complaint was with US Bank and the foreclosure of my home. They did not allow me the opportunity to save the home through the pandemic and I still beleive that I legally have a claim against them as their lawyer requested a dismal of the foreclosure judgement but the judge did not act on their request. While I'd love to revisit this as it was unjust after going through the worst phase in my life, including all of my belongings stolen by the the new owner. I have been homeless, living out of my car and still going to work like nothing was wrong. Just as I thought I pulled myself through this, the fallout from this whole ordeal continued to put me on the street. I was just evicted from my current home and again finding myself with no place to call my own. All due to an error in how the bank reported interest paid. In I was working with the bank to bring the home out of foreclosure and become current on the mortgage. I had a arranged settlement where the FHA assisted me paying the back payments and added to the end of the loan. The bank completed the transaction and I received my statement with an ininterest paid of in change. Based on this, I filed my taxes and taxes on the documented interest paid. in both years the the bank stated showed large amounts of interest paid and I figured it was due to the loan amounts added to the note. I filed my taxes like every year of the interest paid statement. I don't recall ever having issue on this. Anyways, things went south and in I attempted a bankruptcy to save the home. The attempt failed and I lost my home. However, the bank never reported the interest correctly and of course took the federal money and bounced it in and out of my account. Not really an issues now with the home lost, but the falsified interest paid in T given to the irs and the subsequent T has caused huge penalties on to me from the IRS. All along I claimed that I had the documents to prove that my reporting to the IRS was accurate with the documentation provided by the bank. Well with al the noise of this I had never gotten the chance to fight the claims made on to by the irs. when the house was taken my documents were all disposed during the eviction process. This error has caused me thousands of dollars in penalties from the federal government and the state of wisconsin. The federal government at least had the decency to let me try and get my feet on the ground but the state of wisconsin not so much. They have forced wage garnishment of 25 % for two years and half years all while putting me back into the financial place I spent the last 10 years. I finally started to act on my recollection of the mistakes and asked us bank to provide the statement from those two months. They did and the amount of transaction of monies in and out of the account from to was mind boggling. However, it shows that I did report the interest payments correctly as they were given to me. This is clear in the 2 year transactional document provided. This justified that I in now way should have been responsible for the audit and fees of over that both the federal government and state of wisconsin are claiming and burdened me with. The problem is getting a tax professional to even act on this, most are in upwards of to address this nightmare. I understand and of course take some blame for not acting immediately but I certainly don't deserve this financial burden. I have not received a dime of taxes paid and still have an outstanding bill of to Wisconsin and the IRS a burden that should have been addressed by the bank and the irs in investigating my claims. The mockery of regulation and the huge burden placed on the little guy is astonishing. The banks continue with record earnings while American tax payers are dragged through mud. I am asking for some help in correcting this and letting me out of a home bought right on the brink of the housing bubble and I was upside down from the jump. I am not asking for a handout, just assistance in correcting the huge obstacle of dealing with the IRS and the bank to do the right thing and address the IRS. I have another claim for the same year where another bank piled on and dumped a 1099-C in the same year. Yes a victim of and greed of filing 6 years after the sale. These two compounding acts have placed a huge burden on me and I would lie assistance in correcting it. I urge the banks to both do the right thing, and address this issue with the irs.

As a consumer in a common law jurisdiction or a state i have certain rights that are protected by law. You have not provided how the car was taken in peace during repossession? And I have provided evidence on how it was not. You have not provided evidence on why you have inaccurate information on my credit account? If a repossession was not taken in peace, and there is no evidence to prove it was taken in peace was it really? Especially if I have provided physical evidence through photocopy to you via email, on how it was not done in peace. . the contract does not provide adequate information about the vehicle being sold. For example, there is no mention of the vehicle 's history, its condition, or any other relevant details. As a consumer, i have the right to receive accurate and complete information about the product you are purchasing, but this contract fails to provide that information. Lastly, the contract includes a clause that allows the seller to assign their rights and obligations under the contract to another party without my consent. This goes against the principle of mutual agreement, as I have no say in who the seller decides to transfer their rights and obligations to. The seller has been sending me improper redemption letter. here are some red flags that suggest the letter may not be in compliance with admiralty law jurisdiction or my jurisdiction of common law : 1. Lack of specific details : The letter does not provide any specific details about the vehicle being sold, such as its location, condition, or any other relevant information. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the legitimacy of the sale. 2. Inadequate disclosure : The letter does not provide a full disclosure of all the information pertaining to the vehicle, including its history, maintenance records, and any accidents or damage it has sustained. This failure to disclose important information could be seen as an attempt to hide potential defects or issues with the vehicle. 3. Unclear ownership : The letter mentions "" Credit Acceptance Corporation '' as the entity selling the vehicle, but it does not provide clear evidence of their legal ownership or authority to sell the vehicle. Without proper documentation or proof of ownership, the sale may be considered invalid.4. Threats of illegal action : The letter contains language threatening legal action against the debtor if they do not comply with the terms of the agreement. This could be seen as coercive or intimidating, and may violate applicable laws prohibiting abuse of process or unlawful threats.5. Inconsistent formatting : The letter is written in a inconsistent format, with some sections using capital letters and others using lowercase. This lack of consistency could indicate a lack of professionalism or carelessness in drafting the document.6. Missing signatures : The letter does not include signatures from any authorized representatives of Credit Acceptance Corporation, which could raise questions about the authenticity and validity of the document. 7. No reference to governing law : The letter does not specify the governing law under which the agreement was entered into or the sale is taking place. Failure to identify the applicable law could lead to confusion and disputes down the line.8. Incomplete or missing information : The letter does not contain all the necessary information required by law to be included in a legally binding contract. For example, there is no mention of the purchase price, payment terms, or any other essential details.9. Lack of accountability : The letter does not provide contact information.10. Overall appearance of fraudulent activity : The letter contains several red flags that could suggest fraudulent activity, such as a hasty or uneven tone, vague language, or contradictory statements. These inconsistencies can make it challenging to determine the genuineness of the letter and the intentions of the party sending it.

very excited to start my only problem is its not in a hands on classroom only online. my grades was a success, i mean i made nothing under a average, everything was an Grade or a high i was excited, i knew it would be a journey but i was prepared, the problem arose months later when it was very hard communicating with student services, having to make online appts for the professor at to assit you with passwords locks, and system errors, and complications with the web pages, and apps, now i purchased a brand new laptop which was not the problem.I was determined to finish and complete the course so i vigoursly studied and put in extra time to take not just one test a week but actually 2-3 in which im sure my professor was impressed because when i did hear back from him he was bragging that i was doing extremely well and my grades were excellent. i was proud of myself. there was problems out of the website for and no matter how long it took i was dedicated to trying to resolve it with the school, uncfortunately it was still glitchy ad was not trying to put me in the system not for tests because i had not one problem with that only with the downloadable app, in which there was no problem installing on my device, but the school system was kicking me out and saying my password was incorrect even after me and the professor with back and forth online, and even via communicating over the phone to get the correct info for log in but to no avail i was still receiving error messages on my end and he exhausted i guess. soon after my mother who lived around the corner suddenly got ill within a month time and then she passed away and i and my children had four more overwhelming tragic deaths that hit our family hard, and it was too overwhelming, so i took like 2 months off of class work but by then i was already at 89 % of completion and my grade point average i believe then went from an average to like a grade point average if not mistaken, i was heartbroken, and couldn't concentrate on studies, i basically was still determined to keep going when i was able to mentally and emotionally just finish and give it my all, the school offered a deference for like 2-3 months for me which i was totally grateful and i i think that may have started in of i believe, or stopped at either way i did have to start back paying like {1 or {1 dollars per month. so the total school contract was like so i paid from to and i know i sent off a payment certainly in which all of my payments came out of Persons banking company from my debit card each month and i can provide statements to CFPB to prove that. also i was being charged a late fee in which included if i was like a day late i believe but from my understanding my payments was on auto draft, but however since my email was hacked and i had to get new card issued out also because it was lost/stolen from that bank it may have tried on those cards unsure but i also did let know i would continue paying them but then they had sent my school account as delinquent to a collection agency several of months later, and by then i was no longer residing at that same address, my landlord decided to sale the property as opposed to continue to rent it out, i was in aggreance since i was there for 7 years and needed to move to an difference environment and raise my family. i was although displaced, and after covid hit there was extinuating circumstances that prevented people from renting, and there was discriminatory practices, scams, and monetary issues with people that prevented certain things, everything was higher, unavoidable emergenies, and financial situations. i did try to continue my payment plan witht he school, and told them i wanted my certificate, they refused me receiving it saying "" its just like you have to start all over again and repay the same thing you already paid out to us from the beginning '', i didnt feel this was necessary or even fair because i paid out that already i think in actuality i had two months left of paying my balance off but the school would not allow it they wanted the balance of all over again. like i said i have proof of all the times i sent them money to the school because each payment i screenshot it and it was withdrawn from my bank account. i just had like one assignment left to do in that classroom in which there was several print outs on web of their school that i did satisfactory complete that assignment, there was no professor in site after the last password tech issues i was facing, come to find out the school did mention they kicked me out the system after a late payment but soon after i paid it i still couldnt retrieve the correct password and log in like i had before so basically iwas on that site for two days on the last part of the course, i had like the pharmacy scripts, and the test for that and the exam, and i emailed professor, called even decided to come to norcross in which they forbid because they said no students come to campus or whatnot, so my communication was limited, i had no assistance, unsure what happened to the professor but his emails and the appts online was going ignore/unanswered, from my understanding the school had to give me externship via and another pharmacy companies in which they did in fact state and then there was drug testing from a lab in area, and background checks, even testing centers available to do the certification, but thats a misconception, deception, false advertisemtn whatever you want to call it because soon as you are about to finish the course they will tell you otherwise about how you have to go through another process that they never told you about, now i could of received licensing through another government agency as long as i was enrolled in so i really didnt need the certification, also received job offers from pharmacy even with a license pharmacy didnt need a certification, they train, and pay for but was withholding things, like when the testing center requested that they pay like does state when students go to test at the in georgia they pay themselves, that info was disceptive because they said we are not going to pay. so its a false advertising just to get your money. so now im stuff without ac career or the income that i previous had and they are wanting me to pay back two years worth of money i paid within a year to them.",Company has

I've been reviewing my credit report and came across some information that raised a few questions. In my exploration, I delved into the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 USC 1681, section 602, which highlights the need for consumer reporting agencies to exercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for consumers ' right to privacy. As a consumer, I've been thinking about my rights and responsibilities in this context. According to 15 USC 6801, it is the policy of Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and protect the security and confidentiality of their nonpublic personal information. Digging deeper, I found 15 USC 1681, section 604, which outlines the circumstances under which a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report. It explicitly mentions that they can do so only in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I want to emphasize that I haven't given any written consent for the sharing of my information, and this concerns me. Furthermore, 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) notes that a financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a non-affiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how they can exercise the nondisclosure option. To my knowledge, I have not been informed of such an option. I also stumbled upon 15 USC 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) which states that no consumer reporting agency may make a consumer report containing adverse information without authorization. It appears that an adverse item is being reported without my permission, which, according to 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A, is against the law. The Act further mandates that consumer reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of the statute. Unfortunately, it seems that and may not be following these guidelines, as indicated in 15 U.S. Code 1681e. Lastly, I discovered in 12 CFR 1016.7 that a consumer has the right to opt out of reporting services at any time. I'm choosing to exercise that right. I wanted to bring these specific sections of the Act to your attention and discuss how we can address these concerns. Your insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

In reviewing my report, these three credit cards were the only ones with higher spending limits that overpaid every month for the last three years.

This is unacceptable and as and speaking to other would have recently dealing with the same issues we feel targeted and suspect credit discrimination. Per credit protection law, During the application process or when making a credit decision, a creditor must not give you different terms or conditions, like a higher interest rate or higher fees ( based on any of these factors ) must not discourage you from applying or reject your application for a loan ( based on these specific factors : your race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age and whether your income comes from public assistance or whether youve acted on your rights under the federal credit laws ) must not consider the racial composition of the neighborhood where you want to buy, refinance, or improve a house with money youre borrowing must not consider your religion must not consider your race or sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity But a creditor may ask you to voluntarily disclose this information because it helps federal agencies enforce anti-discrimination laws. must not consider your national origin But a creditor may consider your immigration status and whether you have the right to stay in the country long enough to repay the debt. must not consider your age unless Youre too young to sign contracts, which generally means under Youre at least and the creditor will favor you because of your age. Your age is used to determine the meaning of other factors important to creditworthiness. For example, a creditor could use your age to determine if your income might drop because youre about to retire. Your age is used in a valid credit scoring system that favors applicants and older. A credit scoring system assigns points to answers you give on credit applications. For example, your length of employment might be scored differently depending on your age. must not consider whether you have a telephone account in your name But a creditor can consider whether you have a phone at your residence. may not ask about your marital status if youre applying for a separate, unsecured account, and you dont live in a community property state But if the application is for something other than a separate unsecured account, a creditor can ask about marital status using the terms married, unmarried, or separated ( not widowed or divorced ) may not ask for information about your spouse, unless Your spouse is applying for credit with you. Your spouse will be allowed to use the account. Youre relying on your spouses income or on alimony or child support income from a former spouse. You live in a community property state. may not ask about your plans for having or raising children may not ask if you get alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments Unless they tell you first that you dont have to provide this information if you arent relying on these payments to get credit. But a creditor may ask if you have to pay alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. When evaluating your income, a creditor may not refuse to consider reliable public assistance income the same way as other income may not discount income because of your sex or marital status. For example A creditor can not count a mans salary at 1 percent and a womans at 75 percent. A creditor can not assume a younger woman will stop working to raise children. may not discount or refuse to consider some income because it comes from part-time employment, Social Security , pensions, or annuities may not refuse to consider reliable alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments But a creditor may ask you for proof that you get this income consistently.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TN,381XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-01-22,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,8198348,2024,1,22

'' After obtaining my funds and vanished without any explanation or prior notice, rendering it impossible to establish contact with them or address the issue. Despite my persistent attempts to reach out to them and other relevant parties, my efforts have been in vain in seeking a resolution. Enclosed, you will find the relevant evidence highlighting the fraudulent nature of the situation. ADDRESSING CONCERNS REGARDING FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES AT US BANK I am reaching out to discuss several critical issues related to fraudulent activities that have occurred within US Bank. 1. It is paramount that I underscore the US Banks role in these fraudulent transactions. They were responsible for initially executing and transferring these transactions to the fraudulent trading platform, thereby bearing accountability for the fraudulent conduct. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has explicitly conveyed that financial institutions like US Bank must account for the intricate and evolving nature of fraud, refraining from outright denials on the recovery of funds in such cases. 2. CFPB has reprimanded the practice of branding customers as "" grossly negligent '' merely due to their unfortunate victimization by scams. The obligation lies with the financial institutions to develop their security protocols and software to ensure the safety of customers ' funds. Unfortunately, US Bank has not met this standard, rendering naive and inexperienced clients susceptible to such fraudulent schemes. 3. I am profoundly troubled and find it utterly unjustifiable that US Bank has chosen to shirk their responsibility by consistently ignoring my repeated attempts to address this fraudulent complaint. Despite the numerous letters and messages, I have sent to inform them of my concern, their actions demonstrate a lack of professionalism, a failure to uphold regulatory obligations, and a substandard approach to ensuring customer protection. This conduct starkly contradicts the core mission of financial institutions, which is to prioritize the well-being and security of their customers. 4. I am truly perplexed by the US Banks resistance to aiding me in recovering the funds that were unlawfully seized by When I authorized the payments, I was entirely unaware of the fraudulent nature of the involved entities ; it was only subsequently that I uncovered the truth. I implore the US Bank to assume full accountability for the situation and proactively take measures to retrieve my stolen funds. It is imperative to recognize that the scammers not only failed to provide any services but also deliberately misrepresented themselvesto ensnare me. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF RECEIVED SERVICES Unbeknownst Funds Transfer : Funds were surreptitiously transferred without my knowledge by the fraudulent individual named along with her introduced platform These scammers deceitfully presented themselves as trustworthy, offering trading opportunities and financial services. Under the guise of generating profits and extending financial aid, they enticed me and others. However, they consistently failed to fulfill any of their promises, with their true intent being the illicit extraction of money from unsuspecting victims. Fabricated Documentation : The fraudulent activities of and included the fabrication of documents that portrayed them as legitimate entities. These deceptive documents were strategically employed to establish false credibility, persuading me and other individuals to entrust our funds to them and goal was to perpetrate financial fraud by deceiving people into trading. Inadequate Services Rendered : Despite depositing funds with the expectation of receiving the promised services and returns, the scammers vanished without a trace after obtaining my funds. This sudden demand left me in a state of shock and financial distress, as the funds entrusted to and their accomplices remained unrecovered. Deceptive Practices : I was lured into depositing funds under misleading pretenses, under the belief that and would generate substantial profits. Regrettably, their promises proved to be hollow falsehoods. Not only did the projected profits fail to materialize, but my funds were also misappropriated, and the reimbursement they had promised was never delivered. False Trading Claims and Manipulation and manipulated and coerced me into depositing additional funds by peddling deceptive claims about doubling investments and ensuring immediate returns. Through the introduced platform they falsified information to create the illusion of genuine profits, persuading me to invest more. These additional funds served solely to benefit them, with no legitimate services being provided. In summary, the scammers and failed to deliver any of the promised services. Instead, their actions exacerbated my financial circumstances, leading to considerable losses and substantial harm to my overall financial stability. OUTLINING MY DESIRED RESOLUTION FROM US BANK With the assistance of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) I humbly submit the following requests and expectations to US Bank regarding the fraudulent occurrence concerning the entities It's essential for me that US Bank acknowledges their role in facilitating these transactions and recognizes their share of responsibility in contributing to the subsequent fraudulent activities. I expect them to take full accountability for their part in this situation. I'd like the US Bank to commit to enhancing their safeguarding measures and actively taking steps to prevent similar incidents in the future. This should encompass a review and improvement of their due diligence processes and security protocols. Ultimately, my goal is to rebuild trust in US Banks services. I believe this can be achieved if they address the situation comprehensively, fully acknowledge their responsibilities, and take concrete steps to ensure the security of future transactions. Furthermore, I earnestly implore the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to step in and collaborate with US Bank to fully grasp the seriousness of this situation. Ensuring the well-being and safeguarding the interests of US Bank clients must be the foremost priority. I kindly seek regular communication from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stay informed about the ongoing progress in resolving this issue. This transparency holds significant value for me.

Your agency 's failure to secure such consent is a clear breach of state law.4. *Unauthorized Addition of Items to Credit Report : * - The unauthorized addition of items to my credit report without proper validation and consumer consent further violates federal and state regulations, undermining the accuracy and integrity of my credit history.Furthermore, it is crucial to emphasize the emotional distress caused by these violations : The unauthorized use of my private information and coercive tactics have left me feeling scared, nervous, and unsafe. This emotional distress is a direct result of your agency 's actions, compounding the urgency for resolution.I demand immediate corrective action, including providing written validation of the debt within 30 days and confirming my explicit consent for your agency to access my consumer report and non-public personal information.

I got the card in The first problem was I was not receiving statements and I had wondered about how to go about getting the bonus miles. I called into the number on the back of the card which also is hard to navigate through their auto reply system which hung up on me many times. After getting through a rep explained to me that in order to get the bonus miles I needed to pay an annual fee which I did pay her that day and I asked if everything was okay on the account otherwise and that I was getting a 0 % promotional interest rate for the next 15 months but now it would be about 13 since the card was opened a few months prior. She said yes you do have the 0 % promotion on the card and everything was good to go bc I was on auto payment. I also requested to have my statements mailed because I can not see my charges and she said she would set that up. Months later I called in because I still was not receiving statements and could not see what I was being charged. The rep which I was on the phone with for about 2 hours in told me that I was actually being charged am insane amount of interest which was over 20 % for months now and it was around {12 in total so we went back and forth about it and he said he needed to have time to review my phone calls with the previous reps in order to refund the interest being charged to be but that he would call me back on between the hours of and we would go over the details but that in the meantime he could stop the interest being charged if I could pay the card off. I paid him the {12 that day on the spot and he talked me out of closing the card because he was going to help me with getting the interest credited back to me after he listened to the previous calls so I gave him the chance to fix this. I believe his name was I never got a call back from him but he did turn my mail statements on so that I could see they once again charged {290 after I just paid all that money to pay the card off and he told me he was going to make sure my account was corrected. So now I am still getting the run around at getting this card straightened out and getting the interest back when all along I was being told it was 0 % for 15 months. Please help me get to the bottom of this. They are probably taking advantage of other consumers also.

26374,185433,2024-01-14,Debt collection,I do not know,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"Dear Prince-Parker & Associates , * I am writing to address serious concerns regarding your debt collection activities in the state of Florida, which appear to be in violation of the Florida Statute 559. It has come to my attention that Prince-Parker & Associates lacks the necessary licensing mandated by the Florida Statute 559 to engage in debt collection within the state. Not only have you sought to collect a debt that is not owed by me, but you have also reported inaccurate information to my consumer reporting file without obtaining written consent or engaging in any form of communication. This egregious act has not only harmed my credit reputation but has also affected my ability to obtain credit. The gravity of your actions is further underscored by the provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 15 U.S. Code 1692, which was enacted to eliminate abusive debt collection practices. Section 1692 ( a ) highlights the evidence of abusive practices contributing to personal bankruptcies, marital instability, job loss, and invasions of individual privacy. The inadequacy of existing laws to address these issues led to the establishment of the FDCPA. Section 1692a of the FDCPA provides crucial definitions for terms such as "" communication, '' "" consumer, '' "" creditor, '' "" debt, '' and "" debt collector. '' Your activities fall under the definition of a debt collector, as outlined in Section 1692a ( 6 ) given your use of instruments of interstate commerce or the mails in a business whose principal purpose is the collection of debts. Moreover, Section 1692n emphasizes the relationship between federal and state laws, stating that the FDCPA does not exempt any person from complying with state laws on debt collection practices. If state laws afford greater protection to consumers, they take precedence over federal provisions. Your actions not only violate state law but also contravene the FDCPA, which underscores the seriousness of the matter. Such violations contribute to the very issues that the FDCPA aims to address personal bankruptcies, marital instability, job loss, and invasions of individual privacy. This communication serves as a formal notice of the violation that has occurred. As per the Florida Statute 559.565, an out-of-state consumer debt collector collecting or attempting to collect consumer debts in Florida without first registering is subject to an administrative fine of up to {1 along with reasonable attorney fees and court costs in any successful action by the state to collect such fines. I must emphasize that during a thorough search of the NMLS consumer database, using the alleged consumer license number provided by Prince-Parker & Associates , there is no record of their registration or licensing in the state of Florida. This raises serious concerns about the accuracy of the information provided by Prince-Parker & Associates .In addition to the lack of proper licensing, I find the response to my Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) dispute insufficient. Prince-Parker & Associates claims not to have records of my disputes from and of This raises questions about the accuracy and thoroughness of their record-keeping and their compliance with federal regulations regarding dispute resolution. I want to highlight that I have meticulously documented and certified proof of my disputes, including certified green slips and tracking numbers. These pieces of evidence substantiate the fact that I initiated disputes in both and of contradicting Prince-Parker & Associates ' claim of no record. This discrepancy not only adds to the concerns about the accuracy of their response but also underscores the urgent need for a thorough investigation into their practices. Additionally, a claim has been submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the claim number is CFPB Claim Tracking Number This marks my initial complaint, and I wish to bring to your attention that I am in the process of filing a second complaint due to the entirely insufficient response provided by Prince-Parker & Associates . Their response failed to address the pending issue, which is a serious violation of regulations, specifically regarding their licensing status in the state of Florida.Furthermore, according to the verification website I consulted, Prince-Parker & Associates ' debt collection license has been expired since The license numbers associated are as follows - expired Application Terminated and - expired These findings raise substantial concerns about the legality and appropriateness of Prince-Parker & Associates ' debt collection activities, particularly in the state of Florida. I insist on the immediate removal of the alleged account from my consumer reporting file to rectify this breach. It is crucial to understand that this notice is not issued as a threat but as a demand to cease and desist this illegal activity. Additionally, a claim has been submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the claim number is CFPB Claim Tracking Number I am fully committed to pursuing a resolution through legal channels, and if necessary, the next step will involve filing a complaint with the Florida State Attorney General.

This was a lie since the money was in my account and it had a positive balance of {930 on and sufficient funds the following days ( snapshot included ) and the second payment that they took out on was deducted from my account ( snapshot also included ) The problem wasn't with my bank or balance. I asked why they did not contact me immediately and why it has taken 4 months to be notified via mail that my payment didn't process. I asked if they can send me proof via mail of their billing paperwork that shows that their attempted payment was denied and they refused to send me that. It is my belief that Penn Credit 's billing department made an error or did not take the payment on as scheduled and left this debt sitting with them until now. This could have had serious consequences for me if it was reported to collections because I am in the process of buying a home. It is unacceptable that they waited 4 months to send me a letter stating that they still had this balance when it was scheduled to be paid in full on They told me that they tried to call me but they did not leave a message. I received no communication via mail or email from them or until now. Penn Credit 's methods of processing and collecting debt are faulty and potentially damaging to consumer 's credit records, in turn their ability to rent or buy a home and take care of other necessary life responsibilities and needs that rely on credit reporting and consumer credit score.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Penn Credit Corporation,CT,06511,,Consent provided,Web,2024-01-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8234681,2024,1,27

The gathering of the will and obtaining surrogate information understandably took a couple of months. During this time, I took the initiative to make partial mortgage payments, and in I informed Freedom Mortgage of my intention to sell the house. In response to my inquiry, They advised me to pursue a deed transfer, incurring a cost of {1 and taking several weeks to process and submit. Despite my repeated communication with the representatives, emphasizing my role as the executor of the estate, the request for necessary information did not arise until After asking and pleading for several months on how I can move along with the sale of the property. Regrettably, when the information was finally provided, I was informed that it was too late, resulting in the initiation of pre-foreclosure proceedings. Subsequent legal consultations revealed that a deed transfer was unnecessary for selling the house ; being the executor was sufficient. This information would have been extremely beneficial and would have omitted undue grief. In an effort to rectify the situation, I took out a loan under my personal name to cover the past due amount, even though I am not legally liable for these debts. Unfortunately, my attempt to settle the outstanding amount is being rejected by your Freedom Mortgage, demanding additional lawyer fees on top of the already considerable financial burden. I am now facing significant expenses, including {3 for lawyer fees, {1 for a deed transfer that was unnecessary, and an extra {3 for the loan, all while being stuck with a property I intended to sell since I believe that had I been provided with accurate information and guidance from the outset, the house would have been sold, and these issues resolved months ago. I kindly request your immediate attention to this matter and a thorough review of the circumstances, as well as a reconsideration of the requested fees. I anticipate a prompt resolution to avoid further financial strain and potential legal actions. Your cooperation in rectifying this situation is highly appreciated.

I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and alarm regarding the unauthorized transaction on my account. As discussed during our recent call on with Wells Fargo representative, the previous initial claim filed directly with Wells Fargo has gotten closed and denied ; thus, I followed up with filing a CFPB complaint and received follow-up calls ( total of calls follow-up from the bank failed, the follow-up call as promised to escalate to executive level for further decision has also failed to notify me and closed the complaint without notification ) While I appreciate their efforts to address my concerns, it is imperative to confront the glaring security lapses that have paved the way for this breach. The revelation that the location log indicated a different location from where I was supposedly conducting the transaction is not just concerning but wholly unacceptable. This disclosure raises serious questions about the reliability of Wells Fargo 's security measures and its ability to detect anomalies that could signal potential fraud, which be the initiated cause of multiple unauthorized wire transfers resulting in a total loss of {75 from Wells Fargo. The representative at the time contacting to investigate indicated a lack of knowledge of the account was potentially being hacked and misconducted bypassed their security and revealing an incorrect location log that is mismatched with my information. It is disconcerting to discover that the bank 's system failed to recognize the disparities in location data, leaving me to question the efficacy of the security protocols touted by Wells Fargo. This breakdown suggests a significant vulnerability in your infrastructure, one that malicious actors using sophisticated techniques, such as the use of anti-counterfeiting base stations and the circumvention of fraud prevention measures, could potentially exploit. I insist that Wells Fargo conduct immediate and thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding this incident and urge them to provide the log, if, they are not capable of proving the ability to detect unauthorized logins and unauthorized transactions. It is crucial to understand how such a breach occurred and, more importantly, what steps the bank plans to take to rectify these security deficiencies promptly. Furthermore, I demand a reevaluation of the decision per the representative of the bank claim not to reimburse the lost funds, considering the apparent security lapses that have played a pivotal role in this incident. I have always trusted Wells Fargo to uphold the highest standards of security, and this breach calls into question the bank 's commitment to protecting its customers. I expect an expedited and comprehensive review of Wells Fargo 's security measures, with a transparent and decisive plan of action to address identified vulnerabilities. In addition, please have the bank reach out for mediation with proper familiarity to the case instead of repeatedly questioning the incident while the claims themselves describe the incident details.

I had paid alot money since two years, but the loan still show a remaining balances of When I started reviewing the company I find out they have been involved in bad tactics to fraud customers. Why this company still in business? misrepresenting the cost of credit and tricking its customers into high-cost loans on used cars. The car-buying experience turns into a nightmare for many of Credit Acceptances borrowers, who face unaffordable monthly payments, vehicle repossessions, and debt collection lawsuits. The joint complaint alleges that, among other things, Credit Acceptance hides costs in loan agreements and sets consumers up to fail. The complaint also alleges that Credit Acceptance violated usury limits and other consumer and investor protection laws. The lawsuit seeks to force Credit Acceptance to stop its illegal practices, reimburse harmed consumers, pay back wrongfully earned gains, and pay a penalty. Credit Acceptance obscured the true cost of its loans to car buyers, leading to severe financial distress for borrowers and subjecting them to aggressive debt collection tactics on loans its own systems predicted that borrowers cant afford to repay, said CFPB The CFPB and the New York Attorney General seek to halt Credit Acceptance 's illegal practices and make consumers whole claimed to help low-income New Yorkers purchase cars, but instead, drove them straight into debt, said New York Attorney General steered hardworking New Yorkers onto a path of financial ruin by tricking them into unaffordable, high-interest auto loans while cutting backroom deals with dealers to increase their own profits. These predatory actions hurt innocent people and left them with mountains of debt. I thank the CFPB for their partnership to stop this harm and protect everyday New Yorkers. Credit Acceptance ) is an indirect auto lender headquartered in Michigan that funds and services used-car loans for people with low credit scores. Credit Acceptance is one of the countrys largest publicly traded auto lenders and does business with a network of more than affiliated used-car dealers. From to approximately people obtained used car loans through Credit Acceptance and its affiliated dealers. In alone, consumers obtained more than {4 in Credit Acceptance-financed loans. The companys loans typically carry very high interest rates. Specifically, the company allegedly harmed consumers by : Hiding the true cost of credit : Since Credit Acceptances loan agreements nationwide have said that consumers would pay interest at an average 22 % APR. However, the true cost of credit offered is far higher than what borrowers are told. This is because Credit Acceptances business model pushes dealers to manipulate the prices of vehicles sold to Credit Acceptance borrowers, based on borrowers projected performance. This increases the principal balance of the loans. By hiding the true cost of the credit in inflated principal balances, Credit Acceptance evades state interest rate caps and deprives consumers of the ability to make informed decisions, to compare financing options, or to avoid high interest charges. Setting up borrowers to fail : Credit Acceptance ensured its own profits by providing loans without regard to whether borrowers could afford them. For almost 4 out of 10 loans, Credit Acceptance predicted that it would not be able to collect the full amount financed by the loan. Credit Acceptance profits even when borrowers are unable to pay their loans in full by using aggressive debt collection methods. As a result of Credit Acceptances practices, customers faced late fees, repossessions, auctions, post-repossession collection efforts, lawsuits, and ruined credit profiles. Closing its eyes to practices that harmed consumers : The company created financial incentives for dealers to add extra products to loans and then shrugged off whether customers were misled into thinking the add-on products were required. Add-on products, such as vehicle service contracts, are a profit center for Credit Acceptance. They represented about {250 in revenue in alone. When borrowers default on loans, it can lead to severe consequences, including wage garnishment and an inability to borrow money in the future. A default on an auto loan can also lead to the borrower losing their means of transportation, which can cause job loss and a further spiral of damaged credit and financial distress. This is not the only action targeting Credit Acceptance for violation of consumer financial protection laws. For example, last year, the Massachusetts Attorney General secured more than {27 for thousands of families harmed by Credit Acceptance.

2014,66528,2024-01-26,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"The issue is regarding an over 30 day late payment note on my and my mom 's credit histories all stemming from a payment and language-access issue. The issue first began when my mom went on the Freedom Mortgage site to submit payment in that was due on However, there was an issue with the payment and it did not go through correctly. Unfortunately, my mom did not realize the payment did not go through and made her standard mortgage payment on that was due on It is not until she received a letter in the mail in stating that Freedom Mortgage had not received her mortgage payment that she realized was behind in her payments. As soon as she realizes this, she calls on to understand and rectify the issue. In that call, she is connected with an individual who she is able to explain that there must have an issue with the payment processing. She was able to talk to this person in both and Englishmy mother is a native speaker and has limited English proficient. She told the individual that she had made the payment, but it must have gone to the wrong account. The Freedom Mortgage agent ( "" Agent 1 ) then confirms to her that she can see that she tried to make a payment, but that it seemed to have been erroneously placed in the escrow account instead. Recognizing the issue was due to a misallocation of funds, Agent 1 tells her he will fix it and reverse the late charge. See FM Payment History showing a reversed late fee charge on Agent 1 then tells my mother that as long as she makes the payment for next month, she will be fine and there will be no negative impact. My mother then makes the payment on See FM Payment History. In making that payment online, she sees that her account is still reflecting that she is behind on her mortgage so she calls again around or on During her first call, she is connect to another Freedom Mortgage agent ( "" Agent 2 '' ) In that call, she first asks for a individual, but is told by Agent 2 that the office does not have any agents. My mother then tries to explain the situation in English - while explaining English is not her language - and Agent 2 just keeps restating that no payments have been made that she can help only in English. My mom asks if she can be connected to someone else and Agent 2 states again that Freedom Mortgage did not have anyone in and that they would need to find an interpreter because agents only speak English. Agent 2 then tells my mother she will have to wait until they can find an interpreter. After waiting some time and feeling like she had been mistreated because of her needs, my mother hangs up and calls again to try to talk to someone else. My mother makes another call that same day. During the second call, my mother is connected to a different Freedom Mortgage agent ( "" Agent 3 '' ) Having been told there are no agent, my mom then tries to explain the situation in English. She explains to Agent 3 that she had been told that the payments had been resolved and her credit would not be affected. She further explains she had never had any type of issues with her mortgage before, and that this was all due to a series of mistranslations, misunderstandings, and errors ; she then drew attention to the reversed late fee as explanation as to why she had thought the issue had been resolved during that call. Agent 3 then explained to my mother the situation that occurred, that the escrow disbursement was not related to her payments to the mortgage like she had been told, and that she needed to make the two payments that month to get her mortgage up to date. She told Agent 3 that she would make the payments, but she wanted them to erase the mark against our credit histories since the issue that occurred due to misinformation she had been given ( she told him, why else would Agent 1 had reversed the late fee in ) and Agent 3 agreed. He said that as long as she made the two payments, our credit histories would not be affected because of this mistake. My mother then completed the first of these two payments over the phone that same day with Agent 3. She then made the second payment online on thereby completing the terms Agent 3 had set forth and becoming up to date on the mortgage. See FM Payment History. Since this issue, I have submitted three separate credit disputes to ( on ) and two to without any success. Further, during my third dispute with the agent specifically told me they would not remove the charge unless the creditor, Freedom Mortgage, agreed. So on that same day I also called Freedom Mortgage to ask them to rectify the situation. I was on the phone with Freedom Mortgage for an hour and twenty-four minutes. During my call, I was first connected with a Freedom Mortgage agent ( "" Agent 4 '' ) I explained to them the full situation, along with the language issues, and Agent 4 agreed that given all the errors that our credit histories should be rectified by that she was not authorized to make that approval and that she would transfer me to a supervisor to complete the process. I was then connected to a Freedom Mortgage supervisor ( "" Supervisor '' ) Supervisor immediately made it clear to me that she was not interested in my dispute and that I was just wasting her time. Supervisor literally started the conversation with "" so what happened? '' To which I responded, "" what do you mean, like you want me to give a synopsis of what I want or whats happened? '' Supervisor then sighs and was like "" so what I understand is your mom missed payments. '' So then I went ahead was like thats not a synopsis of what happened, and then summarized again the issue and my ask, to which she responds with, well thats not gon na happen. Thats not going to change. After this, Supervisor then, but go ahead explain the issue you think happened. I then responded with, "" excuse me, did you just say that the decision isnt going to change? '' Supervisor responded, the conclusion was made and thats not going to change. At this point, I became very infuriated and asked Supervisor, "" so then whats the point of continuing this conversation or me talking to you when nothing I say is going to matter and the decision isnt going to change. '' That's when Supervisor tried to backtrack and say "" no maam what you said does matter. '' To which I interjected, "" but if nothing I say will change the decision whats the point of continuing this conversation. Why do you want to know what I have to say if the decision is the decision like you said. What do you even want to talk to me. Supervisor then snapped and said, "" because you insisted to speak with a supervisor after talking to the first person. '' I then responded, "" no I really didnt, she was the one who talked about sending me to a supervisor because she was not authorized to approve a credit report change. '' When I said this, Supervisor placed me on hold for around twenty minutes. After being on hold for about twenty minutes, Supervisor came back and said, "" I reviewed the calls in I concluded the investigation, the conclusion remains the same. '' I asked her if she was qualified to do the review and whether she spoke she claimed she did not need to speak because "" no was spoken. '' I then responded, "" do I get any copy of the transcripts or the record with the analysis of how you came to that conclusion? '' Supervisor responded, "" you will have to get an attorney and get them . '' to which I interjected, "" I am an attorney. '' So Supervisor added, "" ok well ma'am you will have to subpoena the records. '' To clarify, I asked, "" so this is the extent of the investigation at this point and nothing further will be done? So youre telling me what you just did is all that will be done? '' Supervisor was silent for a minute until she then states, "" I will go get someone to begin the investigation, '' and put me on hold again for about seven minutes. Finally, she returned and stated an investigation was submitted and that a manager would reach out to me within seventy-two hours. Since then, no one has reached out to me. A Freedom Mortgage agent ( "" Agent 5 '' ) did reach out to my mother though on Agent 5 did not speak yet she called my mother dispute my providing my cell phone number, requesting I be contacted, and making it clear my mom could not have these conversations in English. My mom refused to talk to the individual after they asked her to share her full social security number over the phone and requested they call me. They did not. So my mom sent me a screenshot of Agent 5 's number and I called them on at ( EST ) Agent 5 did not answer so I left a voicemail leaving my name and number and requesting a call back. No call back was made. I have received no communication from Freedom Mortgage since then about the investigation. I called them again on to request information about the investigation and was simply told I would be called back. This has taken tremendous amount of time from me and has negatively impacted my car insurance driver score so that over the course this year, I will end up paying over {1 more for the same insurance I have always had.

As I believed the savings account to be secure and rarely touched it myself, I did not monitor it closely, and I finally caught the issue in RE : The Checking Account - the situation with Savings prompted me to examine Checking again, and I found a few smaller, unauthorized amounts direct debited there as well, also from going back to They had occurred alongside, but clearly separate from, my normal monthly charges. There is no one among my family or friends who would have had access to these accounts, and my only guess is that an online banking password breach may have caused it.

I sent in at least 12 to 13 documents with my signature requesting that the bill due date be changed to the latter part of the month. Under the statute of a bank it was under my rights to be able to change that payment due date. Despite my efforts via postal mail, faxed documentation that I faxed Wells Fargo with my signature in a time frame where I had been in a positive balance with my payment for the month I would send in a request of payment change date so when I paid my bill would be later in the month. I have documentation of such. I recently have reviewed my bank records for the time that I've had the car with Wells Fargo. Most recently the payment of {210 which on recorded phone call the representative for Wells Fargo stated that she would stop repossession. However due to my state of New York laws and statutes we entered into an agreement where I would receive a legal document stating a warning of repossession prior to any communication of such and I've never received that and I've never received any documentation from Wells Fargo proving they sent me the letter that I legally should have had prior to starting repossession. Wells Fargo was sued for selling cars at private auctions making the client or loan holder unaware of sale. My car was sold I was never told that it was going to be sold I was never made aware that it was at said date per my rights under New York State statutes of law. I was never greeted with a time frame that I could arrange in my schedule of a medical assistant, to come on a time where I now had to prepare a ride after my car was taken for me after 7 years of use in the same detriment of debt. I started this contract at {210 per month. I graciously called after payment of the bill to request that we change the payment due date of the bill. And of course Wells Fargo was recently sued for not allowing its customers to do so. So Wells Fargo prevented me from changing my payment arrangement due date despite the fact that I would call in a payment and on that same phone call would request a change in the date of when my bill was actually due for the month. Recent bank records that I've reviewed have stated very odd payments that don't correlate with my actual bank records. A numerous amount of times a Wells Fargo 's representative entered that I paid {12 for the month when I have receipts in money orders and in my bank records that state that I would pay {240 for the month. And then when I would pay I would also request a payment arrangement change of date for when the bill is due. And I would get something in the mail I would sign it I would put the date change and I would mail it back in the correct mailing address for Wells Fargo auto. The next month would come around and I would go to my mailbox and see that Wells Fargo did not in fact change the date that we discussed over my bill paying call and I signed on and now in returned each month from when my loan initiated until when I was incorrectly and illegally repossessed inappropriately. Wells Fargo is going to continue to argue with people it does not want to pay after being sued But also hides documents of request of payment change for the bill despite the fact that the client has copies. And it's Associates enter in payments such as {12 when the entire payment for that month should have been entered as {240 per bank records of client. When repossession was illegally initiated no letter had made it to client and you have no proof that you sent any kind of legal documentation of warning. You also would not allow client to change the date that the bill was due during a positive balance in payment towards the loan. And there is a current open lawsuit against you. And everything that you have done to me towards my time as a client of yours has been every single one of these and more that more people will probably tell you are happening to them too. It's not okay that Wells Fargo Associates have been allowed to enter payments in incorrectly and lose continuous documentation over years and years of client attempts. This is unacceptable to deny clients after the lawsuit that they don't fit into the lawsuit when corrected they do fit into the lawsuit because every single statue of the claimant that sued you to begin with is where I am and I fall into and you've done all of these things to me. My bank records back that up and I'm not sharing documents with everyone to steal my identity and Wells Fargo knows exactly how they're hiding the incorrect way that they repossessed my vehicle.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NY,14420,,Consent provided,Web,2024-01-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8213915,2024,1,25

Information in a consumer report can not be provided to anyone who does not have a purpose specified in the Act. Companies that provide information to consumer reporting agencies also have specific legal obligations, including the duty to investigate disputed information.

So getting a check from a company saying they are associated with was not out of the ordinary.I deposited the check thinking they were refunding me for the purchases that were in dispute. There is nothing illegal about depositing a check you receive. The check had watermarks and all security features listed on the check. It was delivered through Priority mail and the mailman even rang the doorbell to alert me to it, which isn't a common occurrence other that with more important mail deliveries.The check turned out to be a scam. I immediately called the bank to inform them of the check being a scam and what the process was to not only stop it but to protect my own account- which seems to be one of the main reasons we use banks.I wasn't given any info. My account was frozen and wasn't able to access my actual funds from my own hard earned money. Credit cards were being declined that I had on auto-pay which resulted in late fee 's and negative reports on my credit report that I have been working on for the past years to improve and have improved it to a Good rating- but now that is gone due to M & T bank freezing my account and refusing to help me with this. My rental insurance has also been cancelled due to non-payment. There is plenty of money in my account but M & T is not allowing me access to it and causing me great financial distress. They have literally stolen my money and aiding the scam to play out so that I am further caused financial distress. This is not what a bank should do. They should be there to help their customers in times like these as they are the financial experts and the role of a bank is to protect us. They have not. They have made this situation times worse.

During any period when your account has Servicemembers Civil Relief Act or state military benefits applied, the maximum interest charged will be limited to 4 % and all account-related fees will be waived. '' At the conclusion of this period, I had been monitoring my credit card statements from USAA, and received a statement on for a statement that was ending which had my promotional balance transfer still listed on it for an amount of {78 even though my actual balance on the statement itself was for {78 for total remaining balance, with a statement payment due date of I made two payments, one on for {13 and a second on for {65 to satisfy the entire remaining balance. Unfortunately, I then received my next credit card statement ending and was surprised to see a charge for interest on cash advances for {94 I reached out to USAA and was told that effective the end of that the entire {78 balance had moved to a cash advance status and began accruing interest at a 21.15 % rate. There was no other indication on any statement that this would happen, and so I brought this to USAA 's attention via several phone calls and requested that they waive the interest charge because it was not at all clear from the statement that this is what would happen. Their statement actually confusingly has a line that states : "" Paying Interest and Your Grace Period : We will not charge you any further interest on your Purchase Balance on this Statement if you pay your entire New Balance by your Payment Due Date of '', which would lead a rational individual to believe that paying the entire remaining balance, or amount shown in "" New Balance '' at the top of the statement by that payment due date would lead to no interest being accrued. My belief is that USAA is being intentionally vague and misleading with the way their statements are worded such that they can extract additional interest from individuals who otherwise had every intention of satisfying the requirements of their payment due date. I spoke with several individuals at USAA to again try and resolve this, and even received a call back from a who replied from the "" Office of the CEO '' at USAA, however, USAA was unwilling to admit at all that during that call that they thought there was any confusion based on how the statements were worded, and that I should have known based on the terms of the offer ( written above ) that the interest would accrue immediately after the conclusion of the promotional balance transfer date. Interestingly, the first person I spoke with at USAA to bring this to their attention DID actually agree with me that it would be something that could be construed as confusing for a normal person to otherwise know just when exactly a payment was due to satisfy the requirements of a balance transfer, which is what ended up having the call escalated otherwise. Clearly USAA only cares about advertising for and games now, so it's not surprising that this continues to happen, as the culture that exists at USAA continues to be not one interested in it's original intent of serving the US military service members and their families.

1671,58800,2024-01-22,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I am filing this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in response to the update I received from Citi about the status of my dispute. Citi concluded they were unable to assist me because of the amount of time that has passed since the date of the charge. They also suggested in their response that if I wanted to pursue the matter ; to seek alternate means to obtain the credit for my account. This is why I am filing this complaint with the CFPB. I started this dispute early summer of The case ID Documents supporting my dispute were uploaded and should be found under this case ID. Since the amount of time is the issue with Citi, I will summarize the timeline of this transaction from the date of the charge until now. On I made a purchase of a vehicle from the merchant was a licensed auto broker obtaining vehicles from other dealers for their clients. I used this merchant to find the vehicle I wanted and to do all the paperwork. The purchase price of the vehicle was {58 I used three separate credit cards plus some cash to complete this transaction. {17 was charged to my {12 was charged to my Citi Costco Visa Card and {26 was charged to my Citi Driver 's Edge Mastercard. The transaction appeared to be fine months later on the Sheriff showed up at my house to recover the vehicle I thought I had purchased from They explained to me that the vehicle I purchased from was reported stolen by the dealer used to obtain the vehicle. They also explained to me that under California law that the vehicle was never mine and had to be returned to the original title holder. It then took a few weeks to figure out what my options were and sometime in late or early I started the process of disputing the credit card transactions as fraud. So for each of the three credit cards used, I found out the process of doing this and then disputed the transactions as a fraudulent transaction. I explained the situation and uploaded documents supporting my dispute. Each credit card received my documents and started their investigation. Unfortunately for me I disputed this charge as a fraudulent charge and each credit card came back and rejected my claim as fraud stating this was not fraud since I willingly made this transaction. I was told I could dispute this transaction as a billing dispute since I did not receive the merchandise as promised. So I started the process all over again, this time as a billing dispute. So now it's late summer and close to year since the original transaction. I was on the phone numerous times with associates from the dispute departments on how best to proceed and if the information that I submitted as a fraud dispute could be used or transferred to the billing dispute dept. One associate from Citi assured me that all the documents I submitted to the fraud dept would be transferred to the billing dispute dept. This conversation referred to the Citi Driver 's Edge Card. At about that time I was receiving updates from the Citi Costco Card about their investigation. Finally on I received a letter from Citi Costco Card that the dispute has been resolved in my favor and the {12 credit would now be permanent. The Citi Costco Card dispute ID was I am still waiting for a response from the Citi Driver 's Edge Card. After waiting several months for a response I call them and was informed that the case was never transferred over from the fraud dept to the billing dept as promised. The Citi associate suggested I make hard copies of documents and statements and mail them directly to the Citi billing dispute dept. It is now and I make the copies and mail them off. Then in early I receive a letter from Citi stating too much time has passed from the date of the transaction for Citi to assist me and therefore the investigation is closed. I know this is a lot of money and a lot of time has passed. I'm hoping you will see and understand that the timeline in question was out of my control. It was months before I was informed the merchandise promised by the merchant ended up as being stolen by the merchant. It took several weeks to start the dispute process and much time was lost due to the dispute originally filed as a fraud dispute and not a billing dispute.I hope this explains the timeline of this dispute and you will take that into consideration. I also hope you would look at the results of the Citi Costco Card investigation and take that into consideration.

In addition, users of the information for credit, insurance, or employment purposes must notify the consumer when an adverse action is taken on the basis of such reports. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act added many provisions to this Act primarily relating to record accuracy and identity theft. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau most of the rulemaking responsibilities added to this Act by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Credit CARD Act, but the Commission retains all its enforcement authority.

I am writing to file a formal complaint against U.S. Bank regarding their considering the Checking Account ending in as an opened account of mine. I applied a U.S. Bank Checking Account ( ending in ) and the application was approved on I didn't make a minimum opening deposit of {25 and the Checking Account ending in should not be considered as "" opened ''. However, U.S. Bank regards the Checking Account ending in as an opened account of mine. Therefore, I have a serious concern about the definition of "" open an account '' because the term "" open an account '' is not rigorously defined and clarified to consumers from the side of U.S. Bank. From an official U.S. Bank website ( see Attachment ) footnote 11 in the Disclosures says "" {25 minimum deposit required to open a U.S. Bank consumer checking account ''.On an official U.S. Bank webpage ( see Attachment 2, "" What you need to open a checking account ) "" a minimum opening deposit of {25 to activate your account ( once youve been approved ) '' is listed as one of the requirements to open an account. In my point of view, an account can be considered as "" opened '' only if the application of the account is approved and the account is activated with an opening deposit of {25 or more. Another similar statement from an official U.S. Bank website ( see Attachment ) says "" open an account in minutes with a minimum balance of {25 ''. Based on the statements shown on the official U.S. Bank website, an account can not be considered as "" opened '' without a minimum balance of {25 from the consumers ' perspective.Moreover, I contacted one of the U.S. Bank agents, by which I was told that "" since I had not made a {25 initial deposit, my account ending in was not considered opened ''. If I was clearly told and explained by U.S. Bank agent or official U.S. Bank website that the approving of an application is considered as "" opening an account '', I would never close the account ending in To be concluded, the account ending in should not be considered as "" opened '', therefore I didn't have a U.S. Bank consumer checking account in the last months.

Freedom Mortgage purchased my loan from the company I refinanced with. I had been paying my taxes and homeowner insurance on my home separately for years without any problem. I had through and out of TX. I unfortunately missed payment on my with back in but as soon as and informed me of this, I had them try to get me back on immediately but was not writing new policies back then and would not allow me to go back with them for my homeowner insurance. So wrote me a Homeowner Insurance Policy with that I was making monthly payments on but the policy with that I bought myself did not start until I was paying my monthly homeowner insurance and had already paid my property taxes for the year by the end of My monthly mortgage payment was {620 and my homeowners policy with was a little over {4 a month. My property taxes this year were {33 approximately but last year were {5 I had been taking care of these expenses myself. I am a hardworking single mom. I thought everything was going as it should until suddenly in the month of with no notification whatsoever from my mortgage company, Freedom Mortgage raised my monthly payment from {620 in to {16 in When I called and asked them about it, they said it was to pay my homeowners insurance. I called immediately and they said that my Mortgage Company had no right to do that because my homeowner insurance policy with them was written as a non escrow policy which meant I alone was the only person to make payments on the policy told me that Freedom Mortgage had overpaid my policy by a little over {1 which sent back to me in a check that I then used for my high monthly mortgage payment that I now have with Freedom Mortgage unfortunately. I called and and spoke to who also confirmed that Freedom Mortgage did not have the right to pay my homeowners insurance since the policy I wrote with them was not with escrow and was a policy I would pay myself. Then when I called Freedom Mortgage back about all of this, they said I just needed to write them an internal message that I would pay my own homeowner insurance and taxes and they would fix this for me and get my payment back the way it was before. I wrote the internal message to Freedom Mortgage and they responded telling me that because I had a month and days lapse in payment on my homeowners insurance policy from to when I was getting switched from to they created an escrow account and were paying my homeowner insurance now and for the life of my entire loan. They did this without my consent and without notifying me. They said the only way that they would change this would be for me to show I was covered through which I can not show because I was just notified by my insurance company and then and was in the process of getting switched to When I estimated that since I had already paid my property taxes for the year and that my payment with the homeowner insurance they added in should only be a little over {1 and I asked them about that.

The claim was denied 2 or 3 more times each time I had the same 2 hour call removing the transactions that didn't belong. This tells me that there is no investigation happening or the notes would have been read and seen the amount change and the transactions that had been removed but obviously that didn't happen and I know this because the correct transactions are cut and dry fraudulent and will not provide them with a reason to deny the claim. The denials were coming every 2 to 3 days and I find the speed of those investigations odd since they have had this resubmittal now since and still claim to not have an answer.

Simultaneously, 15 USC 6801 establishes Congress 's policy, stipulating that financial institutions, including are obligated to affirmatively and continually respect the privacy of consumers and safeguard the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information.

As governed by the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) Section 6050P, I had explicitly requested the issuance of Form 1099-C for the charged-off account.In my initial communication, I clearly requested the issuance of Form 1099-C for the charged-off account. Despite this request and the company 's commitment to resolving the matter, ELAN FINANCIAL SERVICE has not provided the necessary documentation.It has come to my attention that, by law and per the IRS, once a debt has been canceled, and a Form 1099-C has been issued, the credit report should no longer show a remaining balance due. The status of the account should be updated to reflect that it is no longer in a charged-off status, indicating that the debt has been canceled or resolved.Here are the key sections of the Internal Revenue Code that pertain to canceled debt reporting : IRC Section 61 ( a ) ( 12 ) : This section defines gross income to include income from the discharge of indebtedness.IRC Section 108 : This section provides exclusions from income for canceled debt in certain situations, such as insolvency or bankruptcy.IRC Section 6050P : This section outlines the reporting requirements for discharges of indebtedness by certain entities, including financial institutions. It requires the filing of Form 1099-C when applicable.Despite my clear request and the company 's commitment to resolving the matter, ELAN FINANCIAL SERVICE has not provided the necessary documentation.

I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding an incident that occurred at the Wells Fargo branch located at CT The incident involved racial profiling and discriminatory behavior on and I feel compelled to bring this matter to your attention. On the aforementioned date, while parked inside my vehicle outside the Wells Fargo branch and preparing to meet with the branch manager, I was approached by He mentioned that a call had been made by someone at the bank reporting a "" suspicious person '' inside the vehicle. I clarified to that no crime had been committed and that I was both a Wells Fargo customer and a business banker affiliated with Wells Fargo. Despite my explanation indicated that he would reassure the caller that there was no cause for concern. I insisted on entering the branch with as I had intended to speak with the Branch Manager regarding a client matter. Upon entering the branch together, the Branch Manager unexpectedly addressed me by name, stating, "" Hi '' which took me by surprise as I had not previously known the manager 's name. When asked for the name of the person in charge identified himself. This sequence of events strongly suggests that I was targeted and profiled based on my race or appearance, which is deeply troubling and unacceptable. Furthermore, it was revealed that it was who had called the Police department, citing concern about a male in a appearing suspicious. This was shocking and surprising, as was well-acquainted with both my identity and my frequent visits, including recognition of my vehicle. In the aftermath of this incident repeatedly apologized, stating that it was not anything regarding the of your skin or anything. I found this comment particularly unsettling because I had not brought up the of my skin in our conversation. His unsolicited assurance only served to highlight the racial undertones of the situation. In a regrettable attempt to ease the situation remarked about my vehicle, expressing a desire to own one, to which I responded in an attempt to diffuse tension by offering to purchase such a vehicle for him or anyone within the branch. This prompted to acknowledge the inappropriate nature of the situation, expressing remorse by remarking that he hoped the perception did not align with the reality of the situation or imply any bias. I, in turn, reiterated that perception often forms reality, and I found it disconcerting to be profiled despite my established presence as a customer within the branch. Such prejudiced actions not only violate basic principles of respect and fairness but also contradict the values of inclusivity and equality that any reputable organization should uphold. Racial profiling has no place in any institution, especially not one as esteemed as Wells Fargo. I am compelled to request immediate action to address this matter. I urge you to conduct a thorough investigation into this incident at the branch, ensure that appropriate measures are taken to prevent future instances of discrimination or profiling, and provide comprehensive training for all staff on diversity, equity, and inclusion. I believe that it is imperative for Wells Fargo to take proactive steps to rectify this situation and demonstrate a commitment to fostering a welcoming environment for all customers and employees regardless of their race, ethnicity, or appearance. I kindly request a prompt response detailing the actions that will be taken to address this issue. I can be reached at or for any further discussion or clarification required. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I sincerely hope that Wells Fargo will take decisive steps to uphold its values and prevent such incidents from recurring in the future.

So this company has a proven track record of issues both legally and financially for their "" practices ''. Here is a link as proof that 3 states have lawsuits or actions against this company to verify what I am saying I have NEVER had any company called "" Bridgecrest '' ever call my cell phone ever. I submitted evidence of this with my last complaint through the CFPB. I had scammers called '' and other names of personal people call me over and over so I refused to answer such scammer calls as my name has been part of several data breaches through medical, financial and other breaches and I have had to freeze my credit files with all 3 credit companies. They claim in their rebuttal to my first complaint with the CFPB that they, "" Bridgecrest '' called me. They never did.

Bridgecrest, never once called me and I went over my phone records through to verifiy this. So they lied. I have evidence they lied that "" Bridgecrest '' ever contacted me. Legally, a company can not have a personal cell phone number, they must identify themselves as the company they claim to be, which they have never done.

I also am requesting formally from the government and the CFPB for Bridgcrest to idenify who '' is and transmit that information to me and to the government and to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau immediately as they gave my number to this person to harass me nonstop on my cell and impersonate a company called Bridgecrest.

I refuse to call any number they provide since the scammer '' got my number and several other individuals who are scammers who pretend to be this company called Bridgecrest as I have no way of knowing the number is real. I demand they give me the reason why called me over and over as they failed to address this in their last reply to my CFPB complaint. WHO IS AND WHY DID BRIDGECREST GIVE HER MY PHONE NUMBER? Payment Due Date is Illegal Window of 0 Days! Also, like all car loans, you have a window to pay and I was told that. Now Bridgecrest is saying you have 0 days of leeway on your due date. Really?

The company has violated multiple statutes, as outlined below : *Incident Details : * 1. *Unauthorized Furnishing of Information : * Despite my multiple written instructions, including an opt-out letter, US BANK CONSUMER REPORT DISPUTES continued to furnish transaction history data on my consumer report. 2. *Violations of FCRA : * The actions of US BANK CONSUMER REPORT DISPUTES directly violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681c and 15 U.S. Code 1681b.Legal Violations : * 1. *The incident involves US BANK CONSUMER REPORT DISPUTES persistently furnishing transaction data on the consumer 's credit report despite the consumer having previously opted-out and explicitly rescinded consent for such reporting. This action constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681a, which defines a consumer reporting agency as an entity that assembles or evaluates consumer credit information for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports.

After these were made they would make a decision on what to do next. I made a payment of for for and for During this time I made several calls to loancare to discuss what was happening and if everything was on track because I was receiving phone calls and letters saying I wasn't making payments and foreclosure could happen.

Citis response was that my account was CLOSED on so bc they returned my funds in ( which was still beyond 60 days ) then that meant they were within their rights. However, it took CitiBank nearly 3 months to close my account while withholding access to my funds the entire time without even providing a notice as to why my account was frozen - nor did they provide any details as to what I needed to do to remedy the matter or when I could expect to receive my funds. I had to make several phone calls to find this out on my own & I was simply told that I would receive my funds within 30-60 days from the day MY ACCT WAS FROZEN, not from the day THAT CITI DECIDED TO CLOSE MY ACCOUNT. Citi continues to do this to thousands of customers with impunity & they have now caused my credit score to plummet twice in a matter of 12 months all bc they think it is ok to withhold their customers money that is the customers rightful property. Citi closed my CitiBank Best Buy credit card and charged off the full balance after I had never had even a single missed payment for over 7 years of having that credit card. The only late pmts we have ever had were those that were a result of CitiBank withholding the entirety of our funds from our checking account. Citi has held tens of thousands of dollars of my money for 9 out of the past 12 months and they did so with impunity. I will be retaining counsel if Citi doesnt rectify this matter immediately.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,76226,,Consent provided,Web,2024-01-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8101493,2024,1,4

My case number is and the situation revolves around an unauthorized charge on a credit card that I closed in The charge in question was added to my closed account in for a subscription that I had already canceled. I possess written confirmation from the merchant, dated affirming the cancellation and assuring me that no further charges would occur. Despite providing this evidence and requesting the reopening of my dispute case, I have been informed by Barclay Bank that they are unwilling to reverse the charges. This denial is perplexing and frustrating, as it contradicts both the evidence I possess and the assurances made by the merchant. I am reaching out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the hope that you can investigate this matter and help facilitate a fair resolution.

At the time of this incident, I only had two accounts opened with the bank : my checking and my savings account. Nobody but myself had access to my password or username and I was confident enough to trust the bank to notify me when suspicious activity happened. Unfortunately, I was not alerted when multiple fraudulent accounts were opened. On the afternoon of I checked my online banking account and I quickly noticed that dollars were missing from my savings account. I called the bank to see what was going on as it was after hours and I was not able to go into a branch. As I was on the phone with a representative, I was informed that there had been different accounts opened from to none of these accounts were authorized and I was not notified of these accounts being opened. One of the accounts, in particular, was being used and had a debit card linked to it, they would transfer money from my actual savings account into it and would withdraw the money at different ATMs in a different state from where I reside. The first transfer happened on they transferred dollars and withdrew it at two different ATMs on the same day, the same processes happened on and of dollars were being withdrawn outside of the state in which I live and I was not notified of any of this activity happening. I submitted a claim on the phone and was told that it would take about weeks to get a response. On I received a letter in the mail regarding my claim, In that letter the bank stated that they would not refund my money because the accounts were opened using my username and password. I went into a branch the following day to speak to a representative in person, I got copies of all the fraudulent accounts opened and noticed that my home address had been changed to one outside of the state and my email address had also been changed. I asked the bank multiple times to review my claim again because I was not happy with the results but was always told that because my claim had already been declined and closed, they would not reopen it.

In most states, a security interest in an automobile, a light-duty truck and/or another type of motor vehicle is perfected by the notation of the secured partys lien on the vehicles certificate of title. In most cases, the certificate of title exists in physical form and will be held by the servicer. In certain other states, certificates of title and the notation of the related lien may be maintained in the electronic records of the applicable Department of Motor Vehicles or the analogous state office. As a result, any reference to a certificate of title in this prospectus includes certificates of title maintained in physical form and electronic form which may also be held by third-party servicers. HCA will warrant to the depositor that the originating vehicle dealer has taken all steps necessary to obtain a perfected first priority security interest with respect to all financed vehicles securing the and that the security interest has been assigned to the issuing entity or that all steps will be taken to obtain such security interest and other such assignments. If, because of clerical errors or otherwise, the notation of the security interest on the certificate of title relating to a financed vehicle is not effected or maintained, the issuing entity may not have a first priority security interest in that financed vehicle. If the originating vehicle dealer did not take the steps necessary to cause its security interest to be noted on the certificate of title for a financed vehicle until after 30 days after the date such security interest was created and the related obligor was insolvent on the date such steps were taken, the perfection of such security interest may be avoided as a preferential transfer under bankruptcy law if the obligor under the related becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding commenced within 90 days of the date of such perfection, in which case HCA, and subsequently, the depositor, the issuing entity and the indenture trustee would be treated as an unsecured creditor of such obligor. Perfection of Security Interests in Financed Vehicles. HCA will sell the and assign its security interest in each financed vehicle to the depositor. The depositor will sell the and assign the security interest in each financed vehicle to the issuing entity. However, because of the administrative burden and expense of retitling, the servicer, the depositor and the issuing entity, except where applicable law requires, will not amend any certificate of title to identify the issuing entity as the new secured party on the certificates of title relating to the financed vehicles. Accordingly will continue to be named as the secured party on the certificates of title relating to the financed vehicles. Under the assignments such as those under the purchase agreement or sale and servicing agreement are an effective conveyance of the security interests in the financed vehicles without amendment of the noted on the related certificate of title, and the new secured party succeeds to the assignors rights as the secured party. However, there exists a risk in not identifying the issuing entity as the new secured party on the certificate of title that, through fraud or negligence, the security interest of the issuing entity could be released, another person acquire ownership of the motor vehicle free of the security interest of the depositor, the issuing entity and the indenture trustee, or another person could obtain a security interest in the applicable vehicle that is higher in priority than the interest of the issuing entity. I see that when I provided my application and my retail installment contract with your company, I gave you a security interest which is an obligation of the United States which makes my security interest cash. I see that as a note holder, I have not received an valuable consideration in exchange for my asset backed and chattel paper, as well as, my executed retail installment contract in which Hyundai Capital of America converted into a paper-based securities or certificate of indebtedness and being sold to investors for capital raising efforts which is minuscule consideration effectively masking my lien as a gift in this contract. According to your Prospectus on file with the SEC, all applications submitted through Hyundai Capital of America, its underwriters and its affiliates are being offered as a part of your global capital raising efforts offered in your Prospectus. Since your Prospectus is being presented to investors in exchange for capital contributions this is very deceptive and misleading to consumers like myself who executed a retail install contract with Hyundai Capital of America and none of this information was disclosed to me. This gives me beneficiary status as noteholder of Hyundai Additionally, I provided to your financial institution my personal identifying information in accordance with the Patriot Act under Title 12 in good faith and expecting full disclosure of how my information and personal assets would be fully utilized.

Moreover, under Rule 14a-12, filed under the Securities and Exchange Act 17 CFR 201.31, Hyundai Capital America agrees to be ethically bound to not commit language fraud even in the application solicitations as stated in your Form By providing proper disclosures to all noteholders, Hyundai Capital America ensures that pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to be ethically bound to the language and performance of all of Hyundai Capital America public offerings , filings and commitments made to noteholders.

Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation ) your retail installment contract and consumer products are at the top of your highest grossing tier of revenue for Hyundai Capital American which means that any investment that includes my asset backed security and promissory note is a part of your highest grossing revenue. This would mean that a credit application and my vehicle title which is a promissory note that has a CUSIP number is an extremely valuable asset for Hyundai Capital America. I provided Hyundai Capital of America my personal identifying information through the dealership not aware that my information would be forwarded to third parties as asset backed collateral of Hyundai Capital of America which is denotes me as investor in the Hyundai according to the PURCHASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN HYUNDAI CAPITAL AMERICA AND HYUNDAI WITH AS THE INDENTURE ( Indenture ) The purchase agreement states that all securities derived from the consumer investor in the asset backed collateral is being offered as securities and sold to investors as a part of multi-denomination global securities as defined in Section 2.4 Registered Securities ; Form ; Denominations ; Depositary are converted to floating rate notes and floating rate interest payments that is due and payable to the consumer but instead is generating huge investment capital for Hyundai Capital America and I am entitled to receive the dividend interest that belongs to me that is attached to it as an investor and have my past FRNs returned as well as having all encumbrances removed from my collateral. Most importantly, The Indenture states that Hyundai provides a monetary relationship under Section 13.10 Derivative Counterparty, Supplemental Credit Enhancement Provider and Supplemental Liquidity Provider as Third-Party Beneficiary which means that Hyundai is choosing to purchase third-party data furnishers as a means of denying consumer credit which is an egregious act of securities fraud and consumer rights violations.

The fraudsters spoofed Wells Fargos fraud department phone number and did not trigger any warning from Scam ID that was enabled on my mobile phone. It should be noted that Wells Fargos fraud department calling customers is the standard way for them to communicate and that they indeed routinely ask customers to read out loud texted security codes over the phone to identify the customer. Furthermore, the fraudster could credibly impersonate a Wells Fargo employee by displaying knowledge ( SSN, account numbers, ) that should have only been available to a Wells Fargo employee and performing actions only a Wells Fargo Employee should be able to perform : simultaneous access to the account and the ability to freeze and unfreeze ( ) the online access. Furthermore, when I alerted Wells Fargo right after the second unauthorized money transfer when it was still pending, Wells Fargo waited for four hours before contacting the receiving bank. Wells Fargo was unable or unwilling to explain such a delay. While reporting the unauthorized transaction on the morning of the banker repeatedly told me that this happened every week and that there was no point in filing a police report or doing anything ( I should just wait for Wells Fargo Claim Department to call me after their "" investigation '' ) Also, when it became apparent to Wells Fargo that I had not been the person making and authorizing the money transfers using a new device at a new location, Wells Fargo did not disclose this to me and instead kept saying and implying otherwise. To add insult to injury, Wells Fargo used that fact to refuse to disclose to me information essential for law enforcement to investigate the case ( IP address, recipient 's bank account numbers and codes ) on privacy grounds. I filed an FBI IC3 complaint and the FBI agent contacted me for this information and was shocked that Wells Fargo had not given me all information about the recipient accounts when I reported the fraud on To this day, Wells Fargo still pretends that I authorized the money transfers to the fraudsters recipients ' accounts ( and thus denies indemnification ) while simultaneously acknowledging that Wells Fargo never informed me of the recipients accounts details ( and refusing to provide them now ) While the breadth of incompetence displayed by Wells Fargo is staggering, incompetence can only explain so much and it is still unclear if the fraudsters had inside help at Wells Fargo to : - gather personal and banking information about me and my ex-husband ( he has not been known to be the victim of any documented data breach/leak and yet the fraudster had his SSN ) - unfreeze the online access to my accounts a few minutes after getting Wells Fargo to freeze it. delay Wells Fargos actions for 4 hours with regards to canceling the second unauthorized money transfer or alert the receiving bank to freeze the recipient account.

I request that you delete this account from my credit report as it has been reported in violation of several provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and other related regulations.Firstly, I would like to bring your attention to the violation of 15 USC 1692, which outlines the guidelines for debt collectors and prohibits unfair practices. It has come to my attention that has engaged in practices that are considered deceptive, abusive, and unfair. This includes but is not limited to : 1. Using false, deceptive, or misleading representations or means to collect a debt.2. Failing to provide me with the required validation of the debt and the name and address of the original creditor.3. Communicating or threatening to communicate false credit information to any credit reporting agency.Furthermore, I believe that they also violated 15 USC 1602 and 15 USC 1641, which pertain to the Truth in Lending Act and the transfer of ownership of debts. According to these provisions, creditors and debt collectors are required to provide clear and accurate information regarding the terms of the debt and any subsequent transfers of ownership. In this case, SUNRISE CREDIT SERVICE INC has failed to provide me with the necessary documentation to prove their ownership of the debt and the accuracy of the amount claimed.Additionally, I would like to highlight the violation of FDCRA Section 624. This section specifically prohibits the reporting of inaccurate or incomplete information to credit reporting agencies. It has come to my attention that AND SUNRISE CREDIT SERVICE ] has reported inaccurate and incomplete information regarding this collection account, which has negatively impacted my creditworthiness. In light of the aforementioned violations, I demand that immediately delete this collection account from my credit report. Failure to comply with this request result in legal action being taken against AND SUNRISE CREDIT SERVICE INC for violations of the FDCPA and other applicable laws. I have enclosed copies of any supporting documentation that substantiates my dispute and supports my request for deletion. I kindly request that you conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and provide me with written confirmation of the deletion of this collection account from my credit report.

I had two disputes filed with them which were from the same vendor. I filed two claims with them from transmission work I had done. The first one was the deposit before work began and the second the balance when van was complete. My issue is I am getting two different stories about their investigation. The first claim looks to be closed out and was put back on my card on which made me investigate why? The reason they gave in their letter to me was that the merchant refused to issue a credit and they could do nothing. This made no sense to me since if it was left up to the merchant they would never issue credit. The second dispute I received a letter dated saying the merchant would credit the amount back if I returned the transmission. The merchant knows this is not an option since I had to replace the transmission less than one month later at another dealer and that dealer retained it when they replaced the poor workmanship of the first dealer. After many attempts to explain this and to USAA people they escalated it to their Member Resolution Dept. who was no help and shut both of the claims down as of today How can two investigations for basically the same transaction come up with two answers from the merchant and then just decide that he is telling the truth and my claim is not valid. The Member Resolution Team shut the second claim down even though I had till the to respond to the letter which I did. I was also told last week by the USAA credit card division that they woudl reopen the case. Less than hours later they said their decision stands. I was told that I would have to resubmit and start the process all over again via mail, which also makes no sense. I tried to get back to the Member Resolution team a second time and after waiting almost minutes on hold they answered and I was disconnected.

Apparently, this conversation didn't sit well with this person as i believe she sabotaged my account going forward, due to the following issues with my account I stopped receiving phone calls from Wells Fargo regarding my account I stopped receiving emails from Wells Fargo regarding my account The new account I set up for recurring payments ( I had to do deposit verifications for this account, so the account IS LINKED, ) however, my recurring payments that I setup apparently got cancelled somehow. I went back into my account to try to resetup the recurring payments but the website will not allow it ( attached ) which is even more indication that my account was tampered with.

As a consumer, I am entitled to ensure the protection of my private information, as supported by 15 USC 6801, which states It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information. '' The entity providing information to credit agencies, commonly known as the 'Furnisher of information, ' qualifies as a financial institution under this title. According to 15 USC 1681, Section 604 a ( 2 ) a consumer reporting agency may only furnish a consumer report in accordance with the written instructions of the relevant consumer. In this case, both the financial institution ( Furnisher of information ) and the consumer reporting agencies and TransUnion lack my consent and, specifically, my written consent to furnish this information. Referring to 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) which states that A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. Unfortunately, the furnisher of information did not inform me of my right to exercise this option.Furthermore, 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) explicitly states Except as authorized under subsection ( b ) no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information : Any other adverse item of information, other than records of convictions of crimes which antedates the report by more than seven years. Therefore, reporting this adverse item without my permission is a violation of the law.According to 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A, A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681e mandates that every consumer reporting agency must maintain reasonable procedures to avoid violations of section 1681c and limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b and TransUnion appear to be failing in maintaining these reasonable procedures. Furthermore, as per 12 CFR 1016.7 and TransUnion have failed to comply with all the laws mentioned above. I, the consumer, am rescinding any previous authorization given to whether it was written, unwritten, verbal, or nonverbal, to report ANY of my transaction history to ANY credit bureau. Not only am I opting out of all or any authorization, but I am also requesting that cease and desist immediately from all illegal activities. Finally, the CFPB is required to contact the consumer reporting agencies to update my consumer credit profile accordingly, specially for any transactions that has reported or any other transaction history or experiences I have with please have them fix these violations by deleting these transactions from my consumer report.

It is my hope that this complaint will move the needle regarding my issue, and I will receive the compensation that Im owed. In the beginning of I received a letter from Wells Fargo addressed to my mom. Apparently, my mom purchased a Wells Fargo Credit Defense product and was eligible for compensation in the amount of {290 Unfortunately, my mom passed in the spring of and Im her since my dad also passed a few years before my mom. Before my moms passing, I did contact Wells Fargo and provided the banker at the all the pertinent documents regarding Power of Attorney, Estate and Trust documentation for my mom. This process took two days and the banker assured me that Wells Fargo had all the documentation they needed. When I received the check in I called Wells Fargo dept referenced on the letter ) and spoke with a rep about this matter. I asked him why a check was issued in my moms name, when I had already informed Wells Fargo of her passing in He was apologetic, but said that since Wells Fargo had the necessary documentation, all I would have to do was bring a copy of my moms death certificate to any Wells Fargo, along with my ID, and the check would be cashed. A few days later, I went to my local branch with the documentation and explained the situation to the teller. The teller said she would have to verify this process with her branch manager before cashing the check. She later came back and said I would have to sit down with a banker to cash the check. So, I made an appointment with for at I showed up for my appointment and was instructed to wait for After waiting 15 minutes, I had another banker approach me asking if I had an appointment. I confirmed that I had a appointment and the other banker asked me to wait since my banker was running late. At my banker still hadnt called me and I was getting very upset that my time was not being valued. A different banker approached me and apologized, and again asked me to wait. At this point, I was ready to leave but at approached me and asked me to her office. She apologized for the lateness and said she had no knowledge of my appointment with her stated she thought she had at least an hour break from her last client, and literally was just sitting in her office while I waited for 30 minutes. So this already upset me greatly. I sat down with and explained that my mom was deceased, Im her sole survivor and executor, and Wells Fargo customer service stated I needed to meet with her to cash this check. I gave a copy of the death certificate, my ID and secondary form of ID. I also told her I have my moms legal documents if she required this documentation. However, this information was taken and copied, ad-nauseam, before her passing. So all this information is already in Wells Fargos system called the number on the letter asking them what else was needed to negotiate the check. The rep she spoke with instructed to make a copy of the death certificate, my identification, and that Wells Fargo would issue a check in my name in 20 days asked me to surrender the check issued to my mom, and I was reluctant, but I did give it to her. I did ask to make a photocopy of the check before she destroyed it, so I would have it for me records. I told that I was worried Wells Fargo would not come through and they would bait and switch me assured me that this would not happen, and if any issues arise, I could call her directly. Well unfortunately Wells Fargo did not come through as I was assured. I returned from out of town for the holidays on and received a letter from Wells Fargo. I thought it was the check issued in my name, but I noticed the document was again addressed to my mom. When I opened the letter it stated that now Wells Fargo needed my name as it should appear on the check, Payee Name Change documentation and Power of Attorney. This infuriated me as : A ) Power of Attorney is not required AFTER someone dies, and B ) Ive already provided this documentation to Wells Fargo in I called and discussed this issue with her, and asked me to come in on at with the letter and documentation said she would help me and fix this issue at my next appointment. Today I showed up for my appointment and wasnt even in the office. So again, she has continually failed and disappointed me with a very simple matter. I was greeted by who said he would be able to assist me. I explained the situation to and gave her the letter I received, along with my ID. I also brought Power of Attorney, all my moms Estate, Trust and Will documentation called the number on the letter ) and was eventually transferred to ) in the Product Remediation Dept. After a brief conversation asked to speak to me. As to why, I was puzzled, but I spoke with her and verified my information said she would need to pull up my moms death certificate in order to facilitate this process. After being on hold for 5 minutes stated she was unable to pull up the death certificate. I told her this was unacceptable because I provided Wells Fargo with the death certificate. While on hold with was able to pull up the death certificate, print it, and provide the copy in front of me while I was in the branch. So I instructed to work with so she can obtain the death certificate. Apparently couldn't do that, as she stated her resolution team would have to pull that document. I asked how long this process would take, and couldnt give me a basic time frame. I asked since has a copy of the death certificate, which was validated by her branch could I have her reissue the check, especially since I already came in with the required documentation stated on the letter told me I can not work with and she has to facilitate this process. Yet she can not give me a time frame on how long this would take. This response is unacceptable! I reiterated that this whole process Ive been put through to cash a check less than {3 was egregious. Having to rehash my moms death, bring in documentation that has already been captured since only to have every Wells Fargo representative tell me something completely different at each interaction shows nothing but gross incompetence said I could speak to the Escalation Team about this issue and asked me to hold while she gets a hold of them. She came back on the line and said the wait time was over 30 minutes to speak to this department. This is when I was fed up with her and Wells Fargo overall. I told that I will now file formal complaints regarding this issue. I told her this is unfair and criminal to give me the run around for over a month regarding cashing my moms check. Ive done everything that was asked of me by this institution since and most recently up until I see no need to provide documentation such as Power of Attorney, when Ive already done this and my mom has already passed. This document is no longer applicable since she has not passed. It's more than sufficient for me to show up with her death certificate, her Estate and Trust showing that Im sole surviving heir, and her only executor in order to cash this check. Im now filing formal complaints across the board since Wells Fargo will not allow me to cash my moms check and refuse to show good faith efforts to assist me. These moves feel calculated and discriminatory. With the exception of at the branch today, no one else at Wells Fargo has even bothered to provide me with a clear timeline to get this resolved, nor act as though they care how draining this process has been for me. I lost both parents to and I left my career to care for my mom full time while putting my life on hold for several years. This took a financial and emotional toll on my well being, and I was caring for my mom until her last breath. I was even with her as she took her last breath. This was extremely traumatic, my life has never been the same, and I have no other family to help me get through this difficult time. Each time I have to show her death certificate, her estate documents, etc. this triggers my trauma of losing her. I am urging Wells Fargo to do the right thing and reissue the check in my name, so I can cash it and move forward. Again, Ive provided all the necessary documentation asked of me, and Im angry that Wells Fargo keeps asking for the same documentation repeatedly, and yet they can not pull up these documents in their system. This shows how unorganized this organization is, and this issue needs to now be investigated formally.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,95823,,Consent provided,Web,2024-01-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8141889,2024,1,11

I never received a form and this has happened before with a credit card charge that was fraudulent and the same department said they sent documentation and didn't.
