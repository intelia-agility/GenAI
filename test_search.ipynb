      "[{'asset_id': 'p5d3gk', 'headline': 'Biden is running on, and away from, his record', 'description': 'Washington | Just hours after formally kicking off his re-election campaign, President Joe Biden appeared on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST) before a crowd of union supporters chanting “four more years” to outline his case for a second term.\\n In his telling, unsurprisingly, the record sounds pretty good – more jobs, more roads and bridges, more clean energy, more opportunities for workers without college degrees. In just two and a half years, he argues, he has helped restore America following a debilitating pandemic and societal collapse. “Our economic plan is working,” he maintains.\\n But as with any incumbent seeking a renewal by voters, there is the record he is running on and the record he is running away from. During his address to more than 3000 members of North America’s Building Trades Unions, Biden made no mention of the promises he had failed to achieve so far or the setbacks that had left him with some of the lowest approval ratings of a president at this point in their term.\\n Biden’s record looks different depending on the angle from which it is viewed, all the more so in polarised times when voters and viewers migrate to their own corners of the information world for radically different vantage points. The president is either the mature leader fixing the country as he stands against the forces of evil, or he is the leader of the forces of evil destroying the country.\\n “Under my predecessor, infrastructure week became a punchline,” Biden told union members, mocking former president Donald Trump’s failure to pass legislation rebuilding the nation’s worn public facilities that his successor did succeed in enacting. “On my watch, infrastructure has become a decade headline – a decade.”\\n Trump, now seeking a rematch against Biden in 2024, gave his potential opponent no credit. “When I stand on that debate stage and compare our records,” he said in a statement, “it will be radical Democrats’ worst nightmare because there’s never been a record as bad as they have, and our country has never been through so much.”\\n Along with the $US1 trillion ($1.5 trillion) infrastructure package, which passed with Republican votes, Biden can boast of sweeping legislative victories that would have seemed improbable when he took office. Among other measures he pushed through a Congress with narrow Democratic majorities a $US1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package; major investments to combat climate change; lower prescription drug costs for seniors; increased corporate taxes; expanded treatment for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits and incentives to turbocharge the semiconductor industry.\\n He has been unable, however, to fulfil other major promises, including an assault weapons ban; an immigration overhaul providing a path to citizenship for migrants in the country illegally; two years of free community college; free universal preschool for all three- and four-year-olds; national paid sick leave; greater voting rights protections; and policing changes to counter excessive force.\\n Some of those were never realistic in the first place, but Biden was the one to highlight them as priorities.\\n His economic record is similarly complicated. More than 12 million jobs have been created since he took office as the economy bounced back from the pandemic, and unemployment is at or near its lowest level in a half-century. But inflation rocketed up to its highest level in four decades, which some critics blamed on excessive federal spending under Biden, although cost increases have been a global phenomenon.\\n Likewise, gas prices shot up to record levels. While both have begun to come back down – inflation has fallen from 9 per cent to 5 per cent – Americans remain skittish about the economy, according to polls, and economists still worry about a possible recession.\\n After fitful starts, Biden has presided over the easing of the pandemic and accompanying restrictions despite vaccine resistance among many, especially on the political right. But he has failed to quell a surge of migration at the south-western border, where attempted crossings have hit record highs, and Republicans blame him for a wave of crime, which actually began while Trump was still in office.\\n International ties In the international arena, Biden worked to revitalise international ties that had frayed under Trump, recommitting to NATO and rejoining the Paris climate change accord. But his effort to resurrect the Iran nuclear agreement abandoned by Trump has gone nowhere.\\n Biden’s withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan after 20 years turned into a debacle, leading to a swift and brutal takeover of the country by the Taliban and a chaotic withdrawal of troops and allies, with fleeing Afghans swarming American planes and a suicide bomber killing 13 American troops and 170 civilians.\\n Although Trump has criticised Biden over the episode, the president was carrying out a pullout deal that his predecessor struck with the Taliban, a pact that one of Trump’s own national security advisers called a “surrender agreement”. Some experts argue that the fiasco at the Kabul airport emboldened President Vladimir Putin of Russia to assume that Biden was weak.\\n But Biden rallied the world when Putin invaded Ukraine last year to isolate Moscow and cut off much of its financial ties with the West. With bipartisan support, Biden has committed more than $US100 billion to arm Ukraine’s military and enable its government and people to survive the Russian onslaught.\\n American assistance helped the Ukrainians surprise Russian invaders by preventing the takeover of their capital and most of the country, but the situation remains volatile.\\n This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5dro8', 'headline': 'Why US voters are unimpressed with falling inflation', 'description': 'At a recent health check-up, I had a heart-stopping moment. An African-American nurse told me she would probably vote for Donald Trump next year because she felt much better off when he was president.\\n What about the future of US democracy? “I don’t have much time to think about that,” she replied. And Joe Biden’s economic reforms? “I’m not feeling them,” she said.\\n Anecdotes can be misleading. But there is data to back up the nurse’s view. Under Trump, US blue-collar wage growth beat inflation for the first time in years. Under Biden, it has fallen in real terms.\\n This is why barely a third of Americans approve of Biden’s economic record. It is also partly why only a third of African-Americans – an overwhelmingly pro-Democratic bloc – say that Biden’s policies have helped black people.\\n If US voters rated how a president has acted in difficult circumstances, Biden’s 2024 prospects would look far rosier. He came to office at the height of the pandemic as a freakish disruption to global supply chains was hitting the economy. The US has comfortably outperformed the rest of the world in its rebound from COVID-19.\\n At 3.6 per cent of the workforce, US unemployment is at a near 50-year low. The economy is now about a 10th larger than when Biden came to office.\\n And US inflation is falling more rapidly than elsewhere. It is quite possible that the US is heading for “immaculate disinflation” – the kind of soft landing that usually eludes it.\\n Yet, there is a big gap between the country’s impressive macroeconomic picture and how most Americans are feeling. There is also not a lot Biden can do to change that in the 15 months before the nation votes.\\n The whip hand lies with the US Federal Reserve, which on Wednesday (Thursday AEST) raised interest rates for the 11th time in 12 meetings (it paused at its last one).\\n US mortgage costs are increasingly beyond most people’s budgets. Inflation is ranked as the highest concern by US voters. The only happy people are those at the top with exposure to the sharemarket, which has had an unexpectedly sharp rebound this year. How the rest feel will be a big factor in what happens next year.\\n Biden’s strategy is twofold. The first is to sell “Bidenomics” to voters. This includes the most ambitious series of Democratic reforms since Lyndon Baines Johnson was in the White House – a big infrastructure upgrade, a lot of money for the green energy transition, subsidies to re-shore semiconductor plants to the US, a cap on prescription drug prices, and an overhaul of the Internal Revenue Service so the super-rich pay more in taxes.\\n Political messaging works best when it aligns with reality. Bidenomics fits with future reality: it has the potential to lift middle-class income growth. The question is, how long it will take for that future to arrive? That is mostly beyond Biden’s control.\\n Which brings us to the second part of his strategy – luck. Economists missed the most critical aspect of the post-pandemic economy. They failed to anticipate inflation. Most now think the US is probably going to avoid a recession. Biden will hope that they are right this time. There is really no way of telling.\\n If things go Biden’s way, inflation will continue to drop without triggering job losses. At some point soon, wage gains would outstrip inflation and consumers would start to feel the benefits. At that point, his approval rating would rise.\\n It is just as likely, however, that growth will slow in the next year even if the US does not dip into recession. Monetary policy works with a lag and the Fed is not necessarily done with tightening. In which case Biden would do well to win re-election in 2024, even if his opponent were Trump.\\n There are two points on which Biden has let himself down. The first was his too large stimulus of $US1.9 trillion shortly after he took office. That undoubtedly fed inflation. There is nothing he can do about that now.\\n The second – scrapping Trump’s tariffs on a range of imports, including steel and aluminium – he could do with a stroke of the pen. It would take a big chunk out of inflation.\\n The nation’s elites are obsessed with the threat Trump poses to democracy. They are right to be: it is deadly serious. Blue-collar voters of all ethnicities are also worried about their bottom lines.\\n The worst position Biden could find himself in would be to ask voters to choose between their wallets and their conscience. Insisting that Trump would ruin the economy is probably right (and a lot more besides). But it does not fit with everyone’s recollection.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5d38t', 'headline': 'Why Joe Biden’s 2024 re-election bid is a bold and risky move', 'description': 'Washington: It’s official. Joe Biden is seeking re-election in 2024, paving the way for a potential rematch against former president Donald Trump.\\n Exactly four years after Biden launched his last presidential bid – suggesting he would simply be a “bridge” to the next generation of Democrat leaders – the 80-year-old veteran released a campaign video on Tuesday (US time) urging voters to give him another term to “finish the job” he started.\\n It’s a big ask for a deeply polarised nation. Most voters don’t want Biden contesting the Democratic Party’s nomination to run for the White House again and have little appetite for a replay of the 2020 election with his incendiary predecessor.\\n Indeed, according to an NBC poll released this week, Trump had the whopping support of two-thirds of Republican primary voters, but 60 per cent of Americans more broadly didn’t think he should seek re-election. As for Biden, 70 per cent of Americans, including 51 per cent of Democrats, said they did not want him running again – in large part because of his age.\\n Biden is hoping to mitigate those concerns by campaigning on his first-term achievements, from historic infrastructure investment and manufacturing reform, to lowering healthcare costs and rallying the West against the war in Ukraine.\\n He also has a proven track record of beating Trump, who is arguably the single force that unifies Democrats the most. And just as he did at last year’s midterm elections, the president will seek to cast the Republican Party as extremists trying to roll back everything from abortion access and voting rights to social security, and banning books about race and gender identity.\\n The outline of his campaign became apparent in the three-minute video launched on Tuesday, which opened with images of Trump supporters storming the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021 and scenes of protests outside the Supreme Court after Roe v Wade was overturnedafter Roe v Wade was overturned.\\n “When I ran for president four years ago, I said we were in a battle for the soul of America, and we still are,” Biden said, warning voters that the “fight for democracy” was not complete.\\n “The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer.\\n “I know what I want the answer to be and I think you do too. This is not a time to be complacent. That’s why I’m running for re-election.”\\n It’s a bold and risky move on several fronts. After all, Biden is already the oldest president in American history, and the first octogenarian to lead the most powerful country in the world.\\n The previous oldest president was Ronald Reagan, who left office at the age of 77. If Biden were to win in 2024, he would be 82 years old at his inauguration and 86 at the end of a second term.\\n Supporters and those who have dealt with him up close insist he remains sharp and intellectually engaged. Australia’s former US ambassador Arthur Sinodinos, for instance, told this masthead in an exit interview last month: “I’ve seen him conduct two-hour briefings with leaders, like at the Pacific Island summit, and he is totally in control and on top of his brief.”\\n “For someone who people keep underestimating, look at what happened in the midterms. Look at what’s happened in terms of passing bipartisan legislation.”\\n But Biden’s age has nonetheless become an uncomfortable issue for some party insiders, who note his tendency to make gaffes, lose his train of thought, or struggle with names and teleprompters.\\n Much has also changed since the last election, when the pandemic allowed Biden to campaign remotely from his home in Delaware – and even then, he was accused by adversaries of “hiding in his basement” to avoid scrutiny about his fitness for office.\\n This time, his schedule is likely to be far more bruising, and every stumble – verbal or physical – will be used as fodder by conservatives to push the narrative that the president isn’t up to the task.\\n Biden’s election bid comes in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty. While US unemployment is at a 50-year low and inflation is cooling, interest rates remain high and the cost of goods including food and furniture, rent and fuel remains a dominant reason voters continue to rate Biden’s performance poorly.\\n As of April 24, only 42.5 per cent of Americans approved of his job as president, according to polling analysts FiveThirtyEight. Trump, by comparison had a 41.3 per cent approval rating at the same time in his campaign cycle while former president Barack Obama recorded 45.1 per cent.\\n If the economy falls into recession or prices spike again, Biden could struggle to make the case that his policies have helped Americans through the difficult post-pandemic recovery.\\n And then there are other unpredictable factors weighing on Democrats’ minds. How will the federal and congressional probes into the business ventures of the president’s son Hunter Biden, or the investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents, loom over a potential second term?\\n What happens if Trump doesn’t win the Republican nomination, and the party chooses someone who may be more palatable to voters in a general election, such as Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin, former vice-president Mike Pence, or Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, all of whom are considering entering the race?\\n And what if another serious Democratic challenger emerges? This seems highly unlikely as the president has the advantage of incumbency, and so far, his only primary rivals are long-shots: self-help author Marianne Williamson and anti-vaccine activist Robert F Kennedy jnr, the son of former senator Robert F Kennedy and nephew of former president John F Kennedy.\\n But US politics is unpredictable.\\n For now, the 2024 campaign has begun in earnest and so far, it’s looking a bit like 2020. As Biden sees it, there is still much to do: on the economy, gun reform, abortion rights and democracy.\\n “Let’s finish this job,” he said. “I know we can.”\\n Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

Among these, George H.W. Bush, John Adams, Jimmy Carter and John F. Kennedy stand out.\\n The difference with Joe Biden, whom recent polls show has at best even odds of being re-elected next year, is that they were followed by figures who believed in the system. Bush snr was defeated by Bill Clinton; Thomas Jefferson ejected Adams; Ronald Reagan trounced Carter; and JFK, who was murdered after barely 1000 days in office, was followed by his vice-president, Lyndon Johnson.\\n After Biden, on the other hand, could come Donald Trump, who many see as le déluge. A Trump victory would thus make Biden the most consequential single-term president in history – but not in a way he would wish.\\n For that reason, America’s political temperature over the next 12 months is likely to shatter even its own recent highs.\\n In normal elections, the loser can take comfort from the fact they will live to fight another day. With a Trump-Biden 2024 match-up, however, no such reassurance is possible.\\n A group of Trump conservatives, known as Project 2025, has been drawing up plans to prosecute former Trump acolytes whom he now sees as traitors. These include John Kelly, his second White House chief-of-staff; Mark Milley, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff; Bill Barr, his attorney-general; and Ty Cobb, his White House counsel.\\n In most of these cases their sin was to have refused to collude in Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Project 2025 is also drawing up plans for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act on his first day in office, enabling him to put troops on the streets.\\n He would also “go after” Biden and his family. Which means that Biden, who will turn 81 later this month, will be defending more than just his legacy; the US system itself will be on the ballot.\\n Don’t dismiss the polls It should thus be no surprise that Democrats are prone to what insider optimists call “bed wetting” – bouts of existential panic about Biden’s approval ratings, followed by frenzied relief at any contrary evidence.\\n Both the highs and lows were evident last week. On Sunday, despair set in after a New York Times/Siena poll showed Trump leading Biden by several points in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, five of the key swing states.\\n That mood swung to euphoria on Tuesday night (Wednesday AEDT) when Democrats nearly swept America’s off-year state elections in Virginia and Kentucky and comfortably won a referendum enshrining abortion rights in Ohio.\\n It followed the 2022 congressional elections when Biden’s Democrats bucked the usual midterm rebuke to contain the widely expected “red wave”. A relieved Biden said on Wednesday: “Voters vote. Polls don’t.”\\n Unfortunately for Biden, however, there is less comfort to be drawn from Tuesday’s victories than is apparent. Contrary to conventional wisdom, it was a reasonably good night for pollsters. Most predicted these results. In particular, they show high voter motivation to defend women’s right to choose even in red states like Ohio.\\n Polls were also right in the 2022 midterms, as they were in 2020 when Biden defeated Trump. The notion that pollsters keep getting it wrong is itself wrong. Which means that Biden should take the recent 2024 polls seriously.\\n Year of trials He may also have to grapple with a third-party candidacy that could split the vote in unpredictable ways. What the events of the past week imply is that voters tilt more towards Democrats – especially on social issues, like abortion – but are specifically worried about Biden’s age.\\n There is nothing that Biden can do about that. But he can draw hope from historical perspective. First of all, history shows that polls a year away are almost worthless. In 2011, they forecast Obama losing easily to a Republican. He went on to beat Mitt Romney a year later. In late 1979, Carter was also forecast to beat Reagan. He lost badly.\\n If a week is a long time in politics, a year is eternity. The next year is likely to be especially eventful. From March, Trump is scheduled to face two criminal trials – one in Washington over his role in the January 6, 2021 storming of Capitol Hill; another in Florida over his misuse of highly classified documents. A third trial in Georgia over his attempt to reverse its electoral college result may take place before then.\\n The chances that he will be a convicted felon before election day are high. It is conceivable he will even be in jail. Incarceration is no obstacle to running for president, or indeed governing as one. But it ought to have an impact on swing voters.\\n Second, Biden has taken a hit from his handling of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Many Muslim Americans and younger voters have vowed either to vote for Trump next year or not at all in protest at Biden’s backing of Israel’s high-casualty assault on Gaza following the October 7 attack by Hamas.\\n Yet, Trump is egging on Israel to be far more sweeping. He is also vowing to reinstate the Muslim travel ban that he tried and failed to implement the first time he was president.\\n Ironically, the Israel crisis ought to have showcased Biden’s vigour. Only twice in history has a US president entered a foreign war zone – both times it was Biden (in Israel last month and Ukraine in February).\\n For an old man in supposed decline, Biden is doing a great impression of being in charge.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5d44o', 'headline': 'Biden bets against history - and polls - with 2024 bid', 'description': 'The American presidential election of 2024 will feature Joe Biden against the Republican nominee. The polls suggest that person will be Donald Trump.\\n Biden announced his re-election bid on April 25, the fourth anniversary of the start of his previous presidential campaign. Though in fact this will be the fourth time Biden has run for president: his first attempt came before the fall of the Soviet Union or, for those who think in terms of Michael Jackson’s discography, between Bad and Dangerous.\\n Were he to win and complete a second term, he would be 86 when he left office. America’s population is much younger than that of other Western democracies, its economy more vibrant. Its politics, however, are gerontocratic.\\n Those two facts – Biden’s familiarity and his age – help explain why 70 per cent of Americans do not want him to run again, a number that includes 50 per cent of Democrats. Were he an inspiring campaigner, the span between his first presidential bid and his first successful one might not have been 32 years.\\n In 2020 Biden’s candidacy was the answer to a problem the Democratic Party had created for itself. The frontrunner in the primaries, Bernie Sanders, would have been a huge risk for the party to take, given his hard-left policies and the substantial risk that he would have lost to President Trump.\\n Who among the field had the greatest chance of holding off Sanders and then beating Trump? It was the guy who had always been there, the man whose appeal was that, in a time of too much political excitement, he was a bit dull.\\n Four years on, the Democratic Party is stuck with a similar dilemma. Incumbent presidents always run again if they think they will win their primary. The Democratic Party has plenty of talent: Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, Raphael Warnock, a senator from Georgia, Andy Beshear, the governor of Kentucky, to name a few, have all shown the ability to win in places where Republicans are competitive.\\n But Democrats are a more orderly bunch than Republicans these days. No serious candidates wish to destabilise a sitting president’s campaign. And so Biden’s only primary challengers so far are a former spiritual adviser to Oprah Winfrey and an anti-vaccine campaigner. If the field stays like that, there may be no Democratic primary debates next year at all.\\n And yet this is not as sorry a position as it might seem. Yes, most Americans do not want Biden to run again. But reluctant Democrats will line up behind their nominee. And, more importantly, an even higher number do not want another four years of Trump.\\n Approval rating Among voters in general, Biden’s numbers (minus 10 points if you subtract those who feel negatively about him from those who feel positive) beat Trump’s (minus 19). Nor is Biden’s approval rating as bad as it seems if the point of comparison is not just past American presidents but the current presidents and prime ministers of other rich countries. Western voters are hard to lead in the 2020s: Justin Trudeau in Canada, Rishi Sunak in Britain and Emmanuel Macron in France all have even lower approval ratings than Biden.\\n In theory, sitting presidents run on their records. Were that the case, Biden could feel more confident ahead of next year’s vote. He has done more than almost anyone to prevent Russia from taking over Ukraine, without deploying any American troops. At home his big idea has been to pursue an industrial policy aimed at increasing the domestic manufacture of semiconductor chips, thereby easing American dependence on Taiwan, and to hand out subsidies aimed at speeding up the decarbonisation of America’s economy.\\n This may be unwelcome to free-traders (and to some allies), but it goes with the mood of a country that has profited richly from globalisation while remaining convinced that it is under threat from foreign trade. As president, Biden’s boast that he could make deals with the Senate that others could not- because he had spent 36 years working there – turned out to be true.\\n In practice, though, elections are not just referendums on the achievements of the incumbent. Campaigning matters. And Biden is not very good at it. The video announcing his 2024 run was an admission of that: the president is better when chopped into small clips, set against a stirring soundtrack with images of happy Americans, than he is giving a speech in front of a crowd.\\n His vice president, whose autocue sometimes seems to be controlled by Armando Iannucci, the creator of Veep, is not much help either. Voters seem uncomfortably aware that, should Biden die in office, the burden of command will pass to someone who seems unprepared for it.\\n In 2020 Biden hardly had to campaign because big gatherings of people were prevented by the spread of COVID-19. That suited him, as did the economic slowdown brought about by the pandemic. What will matter even more in 2024 is the performance of the economy. Incumbent presidents running with a strong economy almost always win.\\n Which is another way of saying that a Biden-Trump rematch would be much more uncertain than it should be, relying on factors beyond Biden’s control. If Trump is indeed the nominee, he promises a revenge presidency (“I am your retribution,” he declared to fans at a recent conservative conference); and his second White House will be staffed with true believers.\\n The task of preventing that would once again fall on Biden’s octogenarian shoulders. Every stumble he makes over the next year and a half will be a reminder of that burden.\\n The Economist\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5civ5', 'headline': 'Joe Biden’s State of the Union reaffirms an expansive vision of a reformed America', 'description': 'Washington: Joe Biden has used his first State of the Union address before the newly divided Congress to reaffirm an expansive vision for political reform, outlining changes to the economy while calling for law enforcement and immigration policies to be improved.\\n At the same time, he appeared to lay the groundwork for a re-election bid, despite polls suggesting most Democrats would rather see someone else run for the White House.\\n In a speech to a national prime-time audience on Tuesday night (US time), the US President talked up his economic gains as he sought to reassure a fractured nation that “COVID no longer controls our lives” and that American democracy “remains unbowed and unbroken” after the 2021 attack on the US Capitol.\\n Days after a Chinese spy balloon was shot down off America’s east coast, Biden also highlighted Washington’s strategic competition with Beijing, saying: “I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world - but make no mistake about it - as we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.”\\n In front of an often raucous audience, Biden also appealed for political unity, calling on Congress to work together to advance some of his most ambitious policies, such as a ban on assault weapons, higher taxes on billionaires, and greater security at the US-Mexico border.\\n “The people sent us a clear message: fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere,” he said.\\n “That’s always been my vision for the country: to restore the soul of the nation, to rebuild the backbone of America – the middle class – to unite the country. We’ve been sent here to finish the job!” \\n This State of the Union speech was the first since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections in November, and put the partisan divisions of the new Congress on clear display.\\n As the president spoke, Democrats and members of Biden’s cabinet regularly leapt to their feet to applaud him, while Republicans sat in stony silence. \\n He also faced outraged boos after claiming that some conservatives wanted to end Social Security and Medicare.\\n “Contact my office!” Biden responded amid the angry heckles from Republican members. “I’ll give you a copy [of the proposal].” \\n Last year, when Biden delivered his first such address as president, he was flanked by two of his most senior colleagues – Vice President Kamala Harris and then Speaker Nancy Pelosi. This time, new Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy stood behind him from the rostrum in the House of Representatives, in a potent reminder of how the balance has shifted in Washington.\\n Earlier in the day, McCarthy had vowed that Republicans weren’t going to “play childish games” during the speech, referencing the unforgettable moment when Pelosi ripped up a copy of Donald Trump’s address in 2020.\\n And after entering the chamber to a standing ovation, Biden shook McCarthy’s hand and then cracked a joke: “Speaker, I don’t want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to working with you”. \\n Tonight was nonetheless a balancing act for Biden, who has signalled he intends to run for the White House again in 2024 and is likely to make an announcement within weeks. Such a move would pave the way for a potential rematch against Trump, if the former president manages to win his party’s nomination.\\n On the one hand, Biden has achieved a string of policy successes, from cutting prescription drug costs and energy bills, to forging a coalition against Russia’s war in Ukraine. As the president pointed out, unemployment in America has also now fallen to its lowest levels in more than 50 years, inflation is cooling, and petrol prices are continuing to drop.\\n But on the other hand, successive polls show that most voters are still not satisfied with Biden’s leadership.\\n According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released over the weekend, for instance, only 16 per cent of the those surveyed also said they felt better off financially since Biden came to office.\\n Nonetheless, Biden used much of his speech to paint the US as “the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it”.\\n “Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.” \\n He also touted his economic plan, which centres on giving the middle classes a leg up “and investing in places and people that have been forgotten”.\\n “Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible,” he said. “That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind… This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.” \\n After yet another fatal case of police brutality, in which 29-year-old Tyre Nichols was beaten to death over a supposed traffic stop last month, Biden also pushed for “meaningful” police reform, as Nichols’ parents, RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, watched in the audience as the guests of First Lady Jill Biden. \\n “Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car,” he said. “I’ve never had to have the talk with my children – Beau, Hunter, and Ashley – that so many black and brown families have had with their children.”\\n And with the Supreme Court’s justices sitting in the audience, Biden called on Congress to codify Roe v Wade into federal law, “to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose”.\\n Other guests included U2 lead singer Bono, who has spent decades fighting against HIV and poverty; Paul Pelosi, who was violently attacked in his home by an intruder looking for his wife Nancy Pelosi; and Brandon Tsay, who disarmed the gunman responsible for the Lunar New Year mass shooting in the Californian suburb of Monterey Park last month.\\n Oksana Markorova, the ambassador of Ukraine, whose country is about days from its first anniversary of the war against Russia, was also in the audience.\\n Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

Some of it is the economy. Biden’s approval ratings are in the 40s. But most of it is because of his age. That, at 80, he is too old to continue as president.\\n More than half the American people polled on Donald Trump say he should not run for re-election. Many Republicans and independent voters want to turn the page on Trump and find someone who will carry his populist, America First policies but without his chaos, narcissism and fixation on the last election.\\n The United States has not been in such a canyon of unease over the most likely presidential candidates in modern political times. When an incumbent president has exhausted his mandate – such as Jimmy Carter, afflicted with high inflation and interest rates, an energy crisis, an oil embargo, and the humiliation of the Iran hostage crisis, or George H W Bush, who did not see coming or appear to feel the recession across America in early 1992 – the other party’s nominee is seen as the answer. Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton rode waves of approval to renew America’s economy and spirit.\\n Biden v Trump is a different calculus.\\n Why has no serious Democrat – such as Gavin Newsome, the popular and successful governor of California, or Gretchen Whitmer, the compelling new governor of Michigan, or Pete Buttigieg, the super-smart next-gen rising star who struck so many chords in his 2020 tilt for the presidency – stepped up. Why has Biden not been challenged, and the age issue lanced and the Democratic offer to the country rejuvenated?\\n The answer is what happened to Carter in 1980. The country was in terrible shape. Malaise was the word of choice to describe those times and his leadership. Ted Kennedy, the last surviving brother who could reclaim the mantle of Camelot, was begged by many to challenge Carter. It was brutal. It split the party. Carter won that war. Those who saw it will always remember the night Carter won re-nomination, with Kennedy on the stage and Carter trying to raise his arm with Kennedy’s in unity. There was no joint victory salute. That battle left Carter weakened. The result: Ronald Reagan, and his brand of conservatism, smashed the Democrats and romped to a 44-state victory.\\n America faces tough economic challenges today, as does every country. But Biden is among the most successful of presidents and is favourably compared with Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson  because of his achievements in getting more legislation enacted of more consequence, scale and scope on jobs, infrastructure, technology, health care, pharmaceutical prices, renewable energy and climate.\\n For Biden to be torn down by his own party would light the fuse of an outright Republican victory next year. These lessons are in the DNA of Democratic leaders in Congress and across the party today. That history is the principal reason Biden has not been challenged by anyone of consequence for re-election.\\n The question is also asked: Kamala Harris is unpopular. Why is she still on the ticket? The answer is because she excels in the qualities Biden deemed critical when he chose her as his running mate. She has not effectively communicated her achievements, and she is severely underestimated by the pundits. Harris has met every major world leader and engages on that stage. At home, her advocacy on abortion rights, voting rights and gun violence is passionate and fierce.\\n Biden wanted in his vice president what Barack Obama had from him for eight years: absolute confidence and trust from the president that Biden had what it took to fully discharge the office of the presidency if, in a heartbeat, he was thrust into it. That is this president’s view of his vice president, and it is firmly held. She is always in the room where it happens.\\n Kamala Harris is the first woman vice president and the first black person to hold that office. Her selection and elevation are of enormous importance to the black community. Her replacement on the ticket would carry an immense political price, no matter who was selected in her place.\\n This is the ticket for 2024. Is it a winning ticket?\\n While Democrats are more than ready to campaign on all the programs Biden has unleashed to build a strong middle class with more jobs and rising wages, the most likely political effect of his age will be to attract less intense support, with lower turnout in key demographics than in 2020, especially from younger voters. Hispanics are another constituency expressing softer support for Democrats. This could hurt Biden. At the same time, the Supreme Court’s record over the past three years has certainly activated women revolted by the repeal of their abortion rights, of people from all walks of life repelled by out-of-control gun violence, of people of colour angered by setbacks in access to colleges and other opportunities.\\n But in the end it will be Biden against an opponent. Today, Donald Trump is most likely to continue his choke-hold on the Republican Party. Biden beat Trump, narrowly but decisively, in 2020. Biden has every confidence he has Trump’s measure and can beat Trump again – because, if anything, Trump is even more extreme, and more a threat to America’s democracy. Trump as the nominee could cause independent voters and moderate Republicans whose party is hostile to their views to stay home.\\n But what about Florida governor Ron DeSantis? DeSantis wants to take his Florida agenda national. His is a machine-gun assault on a four-letter word: woke. On top of his embrace of Trump policies on immigration, guns and voting rights, DeSantis targets anything that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion, the teaching of racial history, provocative books in libraries, anything associated with gay and transgender rights, and much more. Under his presidency, these culture wars will consume America. Biden believes DeSantis is easier to beat because his extremism is so raw.\\n But in the end, as with Carter and Bush, the economy will prove decisive. A Biden recession could end his presidency. A strong recovery could cement it.\\n Biden is not too old for Australia. Biden is a close and compelling partner with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his government. Their foreign policy programs are in sync, as reflected in AUKUS, the renewed diplomacy across the Indo-Pacific, and on China. The Asia agendas of Trump and DeSantis are not well defined today.\\n Biden is alive. And he’s just 80.\\n Bruce Wolpe is a Senior Fellow at the United States Studies Centre. He has served on the Democratic staff in the US Congress and as chief of staff to former prime minister Julia Gillard and is author of Trump’s Australia.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5ctq4', 'headline': 'AUKUS is a dud deal.

Now that the Australian public is privy to the details of the AUKUS submarine deal, it’s clear what a Faustian bargain it is.\\n As an Australian who has lived for many years in the United States and covered the consequences of American foreign policy around the globe, I can’t think of a worse time to be further entangling Australian defence policy with that of the US.\\n President Donald Trump’s election in 2016 should have been a warning to take a step back, rather than towards, greater military alignment with the United States. It is now unnervingly clear that we survived four years of erratic, uninformed, ego-driven leadership only because of the haphazard efforts of underlings to remove documents from the president’s desk, create informal back channels with military rivals and slow-walk his worst edicts.\\n The presidency of a steady centrist such as Joe Biden may prove to be no more than a breather. His age is alarmingly high, his poll numbers concerningly low.\\n Forty per cent of Americans, and a staggering 70 per cent of Republicans, believe the lie that he is an illegitimate president and that the 2020 election was stolen. This is the nation, a huge section of its population untethered from the reach of truth, to which Australia just zip-tied its military. Trump is running for president again. As of now, he is his party’s frontrunner.\\n If he, or one of his arguably even more dangerous hallelujah chorus is elected, America’s far-right tilt will become steeper, the country’s divisions more bitter and potentially violent, its xenophobic posture towards much of the rest of the world even more pronounced.\\n We’ve jumped into every foxhole the US has chosen to dig, with dire consequences for our soldiers abroad and for social cohesion at home. The next conflict may be even more misbegotten and tragic than Iraq or Vietnam. Will we be able to resist entanglement? There’s no reason to think so. We never have.\\n These eye-wateringly expensive submarines, probably manned in part by American troops, will not make it easier to do so. Consider the erosion of voting rights in key states such as Georgia and Florida. The closing of polling places in black neighbourhoods and on college campuses, the purging of voter rolls, the long lines, the criminalisation of even offering water to waiting voters amounts to suppression on a level unseen since the Jim Crow era.\\n And as the foundation of democracy is gnawed away, the pinnacle also totters, with a Supreme Court stacked with archconservatives and Catholic ayatollahs. The risk of American democracy slipping into autocracy should be extremely concerning to a centre-left leader like Anthony Albanese and a talented foreign minister such as Penny Wong.\\n President Xi Jinping has unquestionably put China on a bellicose and perilous trajectory. Our region is more unstable than it was a decade earlier. The crushing of democracy in Hong Kong has been tragic, the sabre-rattling towards Taiwan alarming, the long hand of repression reaching for dissidents abroad symptomatic of a regime with blatant disregard for both human rights and foreign sovereignty.\\n But as recent mass demonstrations across China proved, President Xi is unpopular at home for his COVID policies and for stifling China’s once-vibrant entrepreneurial economy. If he goes – all tyrants do go, one way or another – and China returns to its former, more pragmatic foreign policy, we’ll be left by AUKUS with immense white elephants, nuclear waste, and expensive capabilities we will never need.\\n If anyone believes the final bill for these submarines will be $360 billion, I have a nice bridge I can sell them, down by The Rocks. Show me the defence contract that has come in on budget, and I’ll show you my pet unicorn. We need those billions. We could use that money to shore up our health system and to help with the clean energy conversion. We could use it to cushion the transition for workers displaced as we do what we know we must do: close the dirtiest coal plants and end logging in our old-growth forests.\\n Instead of making our country a dumping ground for high-level nuclear waste and adding to the risks of proliferation, we could invest more in life-saving green technologies.

Former President Donald Trump’s campaign recorded $17.7 million in fundraising, nearly all of which was transferred from another committee that will not report its donors until later this month.\\n In the meantime, President Joe Biden, his joint fundraising committee and the Democratic National Committee raised almost as much money as all of the Republican candidates for president combined.\\n Some of the more modest Republican earners – such as Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador – appear to have solid support and lean campaign operations built for the long haul. About one-third of the $US1.6 million ($2.3 million) haul by former Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey came from smaller donors, which is high for Republicans and could speak to relatively broad appeal.\\n Warning signs emerged for Republicans beyond DeSantis. Former vice president Mike Pence brought in a paltry $US1.2 million in contributions, raising questions about whether he can draw meaningful backing among Republicans.\\n Then there are the self-funded candidates, whose campaigns will last as long as they are willing to spend their own fortunes – and for now at least, they are certainly spending a lot.\\n Here are some takeaways from the filings, which detail fundraising and spending from April 1 to June 30.\\n DeSantis reliant on big money  In the six weeks between his entry into the race and the end of the quarter, DeSantis raised $US19.7 million for his campaign, $US16.9 million of which came from contributions over $US200, a sign of his dependence on big-dollar contributions.\\n He is also spending that money – quickly.\\n His filings on Saturday showed that his campaign spent nearly $US7.9 million in those six weeks. Top expenditures included $US1.3 million earmarked for travel (several vendors appear to be private jet rental services); more than $US1 million for payroll; and more than $US800,000 apiece for digital fundraising consulting, media placement and postage.\\n It is a “burn rate” of about 40 per cent, which is on the high end compared with the other Republican candidates. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina reported raising nearly $US5.9 million in the second quarter, and spent $US6.7 million. But he had more of a cushion: He carried $US22 million from his Senate campaign into his presidential run.\\n DeSantis reported $US12.2 million in cash on hand at the end of June; Scott had $US21 million. By comparison, Haley’s campaign took in $US5.3 million, spent $US2.6 million and reported about $US6.8 million in cash on hand.\\n Trump’s war chest not yet clear Trump is the runaway leader in polls of Republican candidates, and he has ample financial resources and fundraising ability. But his exact cash situation is complicated.\\n This month, the Trump campaign said the former president had raised more than $US35 million in the second quarter through his joint fundraising committee, which then transfers the money to his campaign and to a political action committee.\\n His campaign’s filing on Saturday reported a total of $US17.7 million in receipts – which includes contributions, transfers and refunds – almost all of which came in transfers from the joint fundraising committee.\\n Where is the rest of the reported $US35 million? The joint fundraising committee is not required to file its report until the end of the month. The New York Times reported last month that Trump has in recent months steered more of the money from the joint committee into the PAC, which he has used to pay his legal bills.\\n Pence joins the stragglers Bringing up the rear of the Republican pack are former Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who raised about $US500,000 in the second quarter, and Will Hurd, a former Texas congressman, who raised just $US270,000.\\n While these long-shot candidates were not expected to raise tonnes of money, observers might have expected more from Pence, who reported just $US1.2 million in contributions.\\n Pence has also spent very little – just $US74,000, his filing shows. His campaign has not said whether he has reached the threshold of 40,000 unique donors, one of the requirements to appear on the Republican debate stage on August 23.\\n Self-funding candidates burn cash On Friday, the campaign of Governor Doug Burgum of North Dakota, a wealthy former software engineer, filed its quarterly report, showing that he had raised $US1.5 million in contributions and that he had lent $US10 million to his campaign.\\n Burgum’s campaign spent more than $US8.1 million last quarter, including an eye-popping $US6 million in advertising, the filings show. He had $US3.6 million in cash on hand at the end of the month.\\n Another Republican candidate, wealthy entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, reported $US2.3 million in contributions last quarter, as well as $US5 million in loans from himself. Ramaswamy has lent his campaign $US15.25 million since he entered the race in February; he has said he will spend $US100 million of his own money on his bid.\\n He may need to if he keeps up the spending. He spent more than $US8 million from April to the end of June, including $US1.5 million on media placement and hundreds of thousands of dollars on travel.\\n Biden’s campaign remains very small It was already obvious that the Biden campaign was running a small operation, but exactly how lean became clear on Saturday. As of the end of June, the president’s re-election effort had a total of four employees.\\n Two other people were listed on Biden’s campaign expenditures as consultants, one for communications and another as an accountant, but so far much of the still-nascent Biden campaign is being run by officials at the White House and in the Democratic National Committee.\\n Biden’s campaign, the Democratic National Committee and its affiliated fundraising committees reported a combined $US77 million in cash on hand at the end of June after raising $US72 million during the three-month reporting period. While the campaign has added a few employees since July 1, it plans to continue outsourcing large portions of its activity to the national committee.\\n This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\\n Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

You’ll know real soon.”\\n On Tuesday, Biden, 80, announced he would seek a second term in office. His goal is to emulate the successes of Barack Obama, George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, while avoiding the pitfalls that befell one-termers such as Donald Trump, George HW Bush and Jimmy Carter.\\n Biden had never left much room for doubt about his intention to seek a second term. But his age and lacklustre approval ratings had generated more questions than usual about whether he can, or should, mount another campaign.\\n In the past few months, some warning signs have been flashing about Biden’s popular appeal. An NBC News poll published on Sunday found that more than two-thirds of voters do not want him to run for a second term, including a slim majority of Democrats. His job approval ratings have recovered somewhat from the doldrums of last summer but remain negative by a significant margin, according to the Realclearpolitics.com average.\\n “Biden’s biggest challenge is that his announcement is not really being greeted with enthusiasm,” said Kevin Madden, a former adviser to Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential bid and a senior partner at Penta, the Washington advisory group. “Instead it’s being met with this overwhelming sense of reluctance.”\\n The president’s re-election prospects were lifted by the better than expected performance of Democrats in last year’s midterm elections, however, which wiped out the possibility of a serious internal challenge within his party. This has allowed him to look past a primary fight and instead prepare for battle against his Republican opponent in the general election, and a possible rematch with Trump — for which many Democrats believe he is well positioned.\\n “Joe Biden has already beaten Donald Trump, and the last thing that the majority of Americans want to do in this country, again, is to have Donald Trump in the White House,” said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist. “Joe Biden will make mistakes, but in a match-up against Donald Trump, Biden wins.”\\n Biden has plenty of first-term accomplishments to tout, including sweeping economic legislation that generated millions of jobs as the US economy recovered from the worst of the pandemic and set the stage for an industrial revival across the country. On the foreign policy front, he marshalled the western alliance to support Ukraine in the wake of last year’s Russian invasion.\\n But there are also weaknesses in his record, from the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan to high inflation that has undercut the benefits of the economic recovery.\\n Biden’s best bet may still be to stress how different he is to Trump, who is now facing criminal charges, and to draw attention to the radical elements of the social agenda embraced by some Republicans on issues ranging from abortion to guns and election denialism. In the midterm elections – even more recently in a closely watched Wisconsin supreme court election that became a bellwether for voter sentiment – the US public turned to Democrats in a rebuke of Trumpian extremism.\\n “Democrats are offering normalcy, and the Republicans are offering a lot of crazy. People didn’t go for it in 2022, and I don’t think they are going to go for it in 2024, either,” said Simon Rosenberg, founder of the New Democrat Network, a liberal think-tank in Washington.\\n Polls show that if Republicans put forward a new nominee in 2024 who manages to beat Trump in the primaries, Biden could face a tougher time.\\n “[Biden] is not where he wants to be right now. He has got to improve his standing in order to make sure that he gets re-elected ...\\u2009but these are do-able things. It is much harder to understand how Donald Trump can go win back voters in Michigan or Pennsylvania, than it is for Joe Biden to get his numbers up a few points,” said Rosenberg.\\n In pivotal swing states, Democratic party officials are already rallying around his candidacy. Charlotte Valyo, the party chair in Chester County, outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said her area was “excited to support” Biden and his “impressive” record.\\n “These are accomplishments that improve the lives of all Americans,” she said.\\n “I think he’s got a great chance to repeat,” said Mindy Koch, chair of the Democratic party in Palm Beach County, Florida, where Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort is based. “I don’t think age really matters, I don’t know why that would be a focus.”\\n Trump, who is 76, “ain’t no young chicken either”, she added.\\n One of the biggest dangers for Biden might be that voters find him as uninspiring as Trump – an equivalency that contributed heavily to Hillary Clinton’s defeat in 2016. But Patrick Gaspard, the president of the Centre for American Progress, a left-leaning think-tank in Washington, said he did not see that dynamic repeating itself.\\n “It was pretty easy to make a caricature of [Clinton]\\u2009... it is far more difficult to do so with Joe Biden,” he said. But Gaspard added it would still be crucial for Biden to carry a positive agenda into his 2024 campaign, as opposed to just highlighting his differences with Trump.\\n “[He should] talk to the accomplishments and talk about the future,” Gaspard said.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5d39j', 'headline': 'The truth about the Biden economy', 'description': 'Now that President Joe Biden has announced he is seeking a second term in office, the most pressing question may be why? After all, every survey of public opinion finds the view of the US economy is somewhere between dismal and dire.\\n What else would you expect in an era when perception drives the prevailing media narrative, feeding what seems like a never-ending doom loop of negativity when it comes to the economy? For all the griping, though, it’s worth remembering George Orwell’s timeless assertion that the hardest thing to see is right in front of one’s nose.\\n Start with the fact that the economy during Biden’s 27 months in the White House enjoyed the greatest and fastest recovery of gross domestic product in modern times, an experience unmatched by any administration in at least half a century, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n That the US has outperformed every major developed economy in recovering from a pandemic that claimed more than one million American lives should dispel any notion the 46th president inherited a situation that was anything remotely like his 12 post-World War II predecessors.\\n Growth in gross domestic product exceeding 3 per cent is three times the average under Donald Trump, paving the way for record corporate earnings, the lowest corporate debt ratios, rising real incomes, surging homeowners’ equity in real estate to go along with the lowest mortgage delinquency rate on record, and household bank accounts flush with some $US5 trillion ($7.5 trillion) of cash. The benchmark S&P 500 Index is up 23 per cent since the November 2020 election.\\n For all that, the labour market is the real star. No president since Lyndon Johnson can match Biden’s record here. He has created the equivalent of six times more jobs than the last three Republican presidents combined.\\n Some 824,000 jobs were created alone in the high-paying manufacturing sector amid the biggest commitment to rebuilding roads, airports, bridges and ports since the Eisenhower administration’s new national highways. The US has a jobless rate that is the lowest in a peacetime economy since World War II, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n Waiting for the downturn Consider that unemployment is at all-time lows in 24 states and less than 3 per cent in 21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The unemployment rate for blacks has never been lower, nor has the gap with the overall jobless rate been narrower.\\n To be sure, the number of economists calling for a recession gets longer by the day as the Federal Reserve continues its unprecedented tightening of credit by raising interest rates to bring the rate of inflation back down to its 2 per cent target.\\n But while we wait – and wait – for the economic downturn that was deemed inevitable and imminent more than a year ago, the cost of living as measured by the Consumer Price Index has eased for nine consecutive months, to 4.99 per cent in March from the recent high of 9.06 per cent in June, and is likely to drop to 3.2 per cent by the end of this year, according to the average of 66 economist forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.\\n As cost pressures moderate, the economy is gaining momentum, with S&P Global’s flash composite purchasing managers index rising to 53.5 for April, the highest since May despite worries about an emerging “credit crunch” stemming from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. This is a direct repudiation of the economic doomsayers (who in their defence could still be proved right if Republicans in Congress refuse to raise the nation’s borrowing capacity that they increased three times with no trouble under Trump).\\n Biden will be hard pressed to build on the unprecedented improvement in the federal budget deficit as a percentage of GDP – shrinking it to 5.52 per cent from 15.6 per cent – during his first two years in office as the effects of the pandemic abate and Republicans controlling the House oppose any new or higher taxes.\\n But the deficit expanded every year under Trump, and Democrats have a superior record pursuing balanced budgets: presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter cut the deficit by 2.4 percentage points and 1.1 points in their first two years, respectively, while it expanded 1.1 points under Trump, 1.3 points under George H.W. Bush, 1.7 points under Ronald Reagan, 3.7 points under Barack Obama and 4.5 points under George W. Bush, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n Renewable energy surge In addition to jobs, Biden also stands alone when it comes to the manufacturing revival, much of it in the Republican-controlled states whose Senators and Representatives voted against legislation enabling companies to spend billions of dollars on new projects because they benefit from government subsidies.\\n The reason the US is experiencing a manufacturing boom is because of the Infrastructure, Chips and Inflation Reduction Acts voted into law during Biden’s first two years in office. Bloomberg News reported last week that renewable power developers alone have already invested more than $US150 billion in large clean energy projects over just eight months, surpassing the total over the five preceding years.\\n Sure, there is much to criticise the Biden administration about, from the crisis at the southern border to the chaotic pullout from Afghanistan and other foreign policy missteps. But as political consultant James Carville will tell you, all those things are just a sideshow to the economy when it comes elections. The key for Biden is finding a way to get voters to ignore perception and focus on reality.\\n Matthew A. Winkler, editor in chief emeritus of Bloomberg News, writes about markets.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5dovt', 'headline': 'America’s new exceptionalism is debt-financed', 'description': 'The buzz around “American exceptionalism” keeps on growing, boosted by the strength of the US economy and markets compared with other developed countries – and to a stumbling China. But this confident talk overlooks the extent to which US growth now depends on deficits and debt.\\n Based on those measures, the US has started to look exceptional in a bad way. Once typical, it is now the biggest deficit spender in the developed world. During the pandemic, the US budget deficit tripled to more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product, more than double the peak in other developed economies.\\n In coming years, the US deficit is expected to average close to 6 per cent of GDP – well above its historic norm, and a full six times the average in other developed economies.\\n How did the US steer so deeply into the red? Most countries have ended the spending programs that were launched to ease the pain of pandemic-induced lockdowns. But all the $US6.7 trillion ($9.8 trillion) in new spending from the Biden administration came after 2020 was over.\\n Most of it had nothing to do with pandemic relief. Instead, Joe Biden used the sense of crisis to launch a latter-day New Deal, building infrastructure and industry ostensibly to compete with China and combat climate change. No other government plans to spend as heavily, leaving the US all but alone on the road to deeper deficits.\\n Fans of Bidenomics see it as smart investment. But they ignore the curve-busting scale of new spending and its potential consequences for US debt, inflation, and growth in the long run.\\n The US has been running deficits almost every year since the 1960s without triggering a serious financial crisis. So the conventional wisdom is that deficits don’t matter. Many economists argue that they pay for themselves if the economic growth generated by new public spending exceeds the government’s interest payments.\\n That feat was easier to achieve when interest rates were near zero, however. Now that rates are rising, it’s almost impossible.\\n Though public debt is at historic highs – more than 100 per cent of GDP across the developed world – it is stabilising in Europe but rising relentlessly in the US. With interest rates rising rapidly at the same time, the interest paid on public debt is increasing, and doing so much faster in the US.\\n More new debt than new growth Within 10 years, US government interest payments will exceed spending on defence and on social programs such as Medicaid. The Bank for International Settlements says developed economies need to bring deficits down sharply in this high-rate environment or end up with more new debt than new growth.\\n The Biden team clearly feels this advice doesn’t apply to the world’s leading economic superpower.\\n Through until 2025, the trillions unleashed by this administration will push government spending up to 39 per cent of GDP, most of it not covered by new revenue. In other big developed economies, spending is poised to fall sharply as a share of GDP, while revenues hold up relatively well.\\n Under pressure from Congress last month, Biden signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, creating the appearance of a new restraint. Despite what look like large spending cuts of $US1.3 trillion over 10 years, the US deficit is still projected to hover near 6 per cent of GDP throughout the next decade.\\n Though inflation dipped last week, it’s still running well above 2 per cent, and Biden’s defenders blame its return on anything but his spending plans, including the lingering effect of global supply chain disruptions. While inflation did spike worldwide, it did so most sharply in nations that spent the most during the pandemic.\\n Few spent more than the US. A recent study from the Federal Reserve attributed two-thirds of America’s recent inflation surge to excess demand, and half that increase in demand to deficit spending.\\n But the positive view on American exceptionalism still dominates. Many favour Biden’s calls for bigger government, dismissing fears of a deficit-driven crisis as crying wolf and preparing for a threat that never comes. They scoff at the idea that foreigners might ever tire of financing US spending habits or buying into US markets.\\n America’s flaws pale and its technology dazzles in comparison to rivals in Europe and Asia.\\n So why should anyone care about the US’s deepening debt and deficits? Because it is now one of the most fiscally irresponsible nations. Its deficit has climbed the ranks to worst in the developed world, its public debt is already the third highest after Japan and Italy.\\n To wilfully ignore this new reality is an exceptionally risky mistake.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5ebxc', 'headline': 'US consumer prices rise at brisk pace for second straight month', 'description': 'Washington | US annual consumer price growth remains stuck at 3.7 per cent, driven by persistently high rental costs, placing pressure on the Federal Reserve’s goal to return inflation to 2 per cent and raising the prospect of interest rates staying higher for longer.\\n Headline inflation rose 0.4 per cent in September, slightly stronger than the consensus forecast for a 0.3 per cent increase.\\n The so-called core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy costs, increased 0.3 per cent in September, the second straight month of increases.\\n While the annual core reading, watched by the Fed, decreased to 4.1 per cent from 4.3 per cent the month prior, the three-month annualised rate, increased to 3.1 per cent from 2.4 per cent in August indicating that inflation is taking longer to subdue than the Fed may want.\\n Recent inflation data underscore how a strong labour market is underpinning consumer demand, which risks keeping price pressures above the Fed’s target of 2 per cent.\\n Citi’s chief US economist Andrew Hollenhorst said the latest core inflation readings show the Fed still has challenges. “The report is likely cause for concern amongst Fed officials who have talked down the potential for a rate hike in November.\\n “Our base case remains for no further rate hikes this cycle, but stronger inflation should keep some probability of a 25 basis point hike in November or December priced.”\\n Macquarie’s US head of economics, David Doyle, also said the latest data demonstrated the challenges in the “last mile” of reining in inflation. “There are challenges that may frustrate progress towards the 2 per cent target.”\\n At their meeting last month, a majority of Fed officials saw a need for one more interest rate hike this year, and they may maintain that bias – despite a recent surge in bond yields – if inflation doesn’t cool further.\\n However, Macquarie is maintaining its view that the Fed will not lift rates again at its next meeting on November 1.\\n Comments from several Fed speakers just this week suggested the central bank may hold interest rates steady at that meeting.\\n While economists took the data in stride, markets opted to reprice immediately for higher rates with losses gathering momentum. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury was 16 basis points higher to 4.72 per cent near 2.10pm in New York. US equity benchmarks fell sharply.\\n Shelter surge Shelter prices, which make up about a third of the overall CPI index, accounted for over half of the increase in the monthly advance and were boosted by the biggest jump in hotel stays in two years.\\n Shelter prices increased by 0.6 per cent, the strongest gain since May. However, many economists think this part of inflation will soon be disinflationary.\\n Michael Pearce, lead US economist at Capital Economics, noted that while rents rose 0.5 per cent, and owner equivalent rents were up a stronger 0.6 per cent, such measures were at odds with private sector indexes of rents on new leases, which suggest the trend in rental growth is “firmly down”.\\n “While the exact timing of how that feeds through to the CPI measures is uncertain, we still think it’s a good bet that the disinflation in rents will resume over the rest of the year,” Mr Pearce said.\\n Excluding housing and energy, core services prices climbed 0.6 per cent from August, the most in a year.\\n Fed chairman Jerome Powell has said the core services measure is a key metric when assessing the nation’s inflation trajectory.\\n Unlike services, goods prices continued to decelerate in the latest data.\\n So-called core goods prices, which exclude food and energy commodities, fell 0.4 per cent, matching the biggest drop since early in the pandemic, according to the CPI data. On an annual basis, they were little changed.\\n Grocery bright spot Grocery inflation slowed to a three-month low and apparel prices fell by the most since May 2020. Piped gas also declined.\\n The persistence of inflation has also dogged Joe Biden’s presidency, with approval ratings hovering around 40 per cent for most of this year.\\n On Thursday (Friday AEDT) Mr Biden again claimed success in having brought inflation down from its 9.1 per cent level last year.\\n “This morning’s report shows core inflation fell to its lowest level in two years. Overall inflation is down by 60 per cent from its peak,” Mr Biden said.\\n The president will face some challenges, though.\\n The unfolding war between Israel and Hamas risks escalating and restricting the flow of oil from the region – which could push up energy costs once again.\\n Health insurance costs could also reverse. They are likely to shift from being a reliable drag on consumer prices to a consistent upward pressure.\\n Last month, the category posted a 37.3 per cent annual decline, the most on record.\\n Mr Biden may also see further slowing in wages. After showing some progress, Americans’ wages are no longer keeping up with inflation. A separate report on Thursday showed inflation-adjusted earnings fell for a second month.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5c62x', 'headline': 'The world in 2023: What to expect', 'description': 'As the new year begins in an atmosphere of economic crisis and uncertainty, our correspondents take a look at the major issues they will be watching around the world.\\n Europe Is this the year the war in Ukraine ends, and by extension the energy crisis that has driven inflation to record highs?\\n Russia’s Vladimir Putin never envisioned he’d still be fighting in Ukraine six months after invading in February last year, let alone a year later, but last month the president conceded the war would be a long one.\\n Ukraine will be hoping the first anniversary of the war will spur a new round of public support for arming and equipping its people to take back Crimea and oust the Russians, the only acceptable outcome according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n Putin, on the other hand, can keep pounding away at Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure from Russian vantage points, making Ukraine unlivable, even as he sustains massive losses on the battlefield.\\n This is the conundrum: the greater the Ukrainian victories, the more spiteful Putin will be in directing his revenge toward ordinary Ukrainians.\\n If the war continues until this time next year, Europeans will have suffered through another 12 months of bitter economic conditions brought on by energy shortfalls, higher interest rates and scarcer food resources with Russia having supplied much of the world’s fertiliser.\\n The International Energy Agency estimates Europe could struggle to procure as much as 30 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas, or 7 per cent of 2021 winter supplies.\\n This is also likely to factor into the next round of climate change talks held in 2023 in Dubai. If voters have been feeling the pinch on energy bills for a good 12 months already, their governments are likely to come under more pressure to guarantee power sources, even if this means turning back to fossil fuels, something we’ve already seen Germany and Britain are willing to do. – Latika Bourke, journalist, London\\n After enduring perhaps its most turbulent year since World War II, Britain’s challenge in 2023 is not only to convince the world of its stability but itself. The country faces a lengthy recession and has struggled more than any other G20 nation (apart from Russia) to rebound following the pandemic. Record inflation and interest rates are hitting families hard, while mass industrial action has also proved a handbrake on economic growth and is testing the patience of a weary nation.\\n Three prime ministers in a year have damaged what little trust in government was left and the latest resident of Number 10 Downing Street, Rishi Sunak, has just 24 months to salvage his on-the-nose ruling Conservative Party.\\n Energy prices have risen to record highs and it remains to be seen whether the UK can avoid rolling blackouts over the winter months. Britain has almost ground to a halt in recent months, with rail strikes as well as industrial action by nurses, teachers, postal workers, barristers and immigration staff at airports. Sunak, who has tried to restore economic stability following the catastrophic 45-day reign of Liz Truss and her disastrous mini-budget, has little room to move when it comes to improving pay and conditions.\\n The one feel-good occasion that Britons have to look forward to is the coronation of Charles III, the first king crowned in Britain since 1937.\\n Charles, and his wife Camilla, Queen Consort, have proven many critics wrong in their first 100 days, with his popularity reaching record levels since the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II in September. Westminster Abbey will be the scene of a slimmed-down but nonetheless lavish ceremony which will have to strike the right note amid a cost-of-living crisis.\\n The ongoing feud between Buckingham Palace and the estranged Duke and Duchess of Sussex threatens to overshadow Charles’ early impact. Their Netflix series has created awkward headlines for the royals and Prince Harry’s autobiography, Spare, is likely to tip the bucket on more family disagreements in January. –  Rob Harris, Europe correspondent\\n South-East Asia Having braved the pandemic, South-East Asia is now strapping itself in to feel the weight of the worsening economic headwinds forecast for 2023.\\n Rising prices for regional staples like rice and cooking oil were a feature this year as were shortfalls of products like eggs in Malaysia and chicken in Singapore, and cost of living pressures are again likely to be a key issue. The return of Chinese travel, if it does indeed transpire, will at least provide a welcome boost to a tourism industry still to get back to pre-COVID levels.\\n Challenges to democracy loom on the horizon, with elections due in two countries that took sharp authoritarian turns in the past decade and in another where a violent military regime remains in power. A changing of the guard is on the cards in Thailand, where the popularity of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha is on the wane ahead of an election due to be called by March. It may be back to the future in Bangkok, with the Pheu Thai Party, linked to exiled former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, ahead in surveys. One of its prime ministerial candidates will be Thaksin’s 36-year-old daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra. But given the governments of both Thaksin and his sister Yingluck were overthrown by military coups, it’s difficult to know what is in store. \\n Whether the election will be free and fair at all is the question in Cambodia, where ballots will also be cast nationwide for the first time since 2018. Last time, the main opposition party was dissolved and Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party won all 125 seats. The landscape hasn’t improved much since, and the new opposition already faces threats and prosecution.\\n The generals in Myanmar have also said they will hold nationwide polls in 2023, two years after tossing out a democratically installed government in a coup. But with ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi facing the rest of her life behind bars, and many of her political allies jailed or in hiding, it would be an election in name only.\\n Voters won’t go to the polls in Indonesia until February 2024 but the jostling to succeed President Joko Widodo when he finishes his second and final term will heat up this year. The contenders are expected to include Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto, a two-time loser to Widodo, Anies Baswedan, who was until recently governor of Jakarta, and Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo. House Speaker Puan Maharani, the daughter of former president Megawati Sukarnoputri and granddaughter of Indonesia’s first president Sukarno, could also mount a bid.\\n Malaysia has just got a new leader but whether a period of much-needed stability ensues is a big unknown. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has had to make serious compromises to put together a government after the election in November, not least appointing a political rival facing dozens of corruption charges as his deputy. Given recent history, it’s certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility that the unlikely union comes unstuck. With a series of state elections in Malaysia in 2023, it will be worth watching whether the Islamic party PAS continues its ascent, having secured the most seats of any party in the federal poll.\\n East Timor, a comparative model of democracy, is the other nation in this region scheduled to choose leaders this year and a familiar face will be a central player in a parliamentary election tipped for May. Former president and PM Xanana Gusmao is angling to return his National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction party to government, a development that would only intensify the push to pipe gas from the Greater Sunrise field to Timor’s south coast and not to Darwin, as Australian project partner Woodside Energy has wanted. – Chris Barrett, South-East Asia correspondent\\n North Asia China is out of the COVID cage and ready to open up after three long years of isolation. This year is make or break for the Asian giant if it is to hit its target of becoming the largest economy in the world. Battered by years of draconian zero-COVID restrictions it has unwound them at a stunning pace. It now faces an infection peak between January and March and its  that are afraid of a resurgence in infections. If it can get through it without a spike in deaths it will be well-positioned to boom. If China succeeds in driving growth back up above 5 per cent, the world’s economy will be better for it, but it will also face a reckoning over how much it is willing to pay to a government that is growing increasingly ambitious and authoritarian.\\n Nowhere will the price of that bargain be felt more than in Taiwan, which will move into presidential election season by the end of 2024. After 12 months of unprecedented military threats from the mainland, few expect it to let up in 2023. The Democratic People’s Party, which has run on a platform of defending the island’s democracy from China, struggled in the midterm elections in November. Its rival, the Kuomintang, could pose an electoral threat for the first time in years.\\n Further north in Japan, the government of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is unpopular and under strain. Kishida has persistently recorded approval ratings below 30 per cent, a number that could put him at risk of exit via the country’s revolving door for prime ministers. Tokyo is becoming increasingly prominent in the global defence and national security arenas as the government pushes a China threat narrative both for domestic political purposes and geopolitical reality. That has drawn it closer to the United States and Australia than at any time in its history.\\n All three will have a major role to play in India at the G20 in September, where members of the Quad alliance will have to grapple with the ongoing fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine and China’s ambitions in the Pacific and South China Sea. – Eryk Bagshaw, North Asia correspondent\\n South Asia India will hit a major milestone this year – recent United Nations projections show it will surpass China to become the world’s most populous country at 1.42 billion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, its dominant political figure for a generation, will be in the spotlight as the nation hosts the powerful G20 summit for the first time in September. A violent clash between troops on the India-China border near the eastern Himalayan town of Tawang in December suggests the frosty relations between the two giants will be another foreign policy preoccupation for New Delhi in 2023.\\n Surging inflation, caused by elevated food and energy prices, caused hardship in communities across the subcontinent in 2022. In Sri Lanka a state of emergency was declared after then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in July, following months of mass protests over skyrocketing prices and shortages of fuel, food and medicines.\\n Further economic difficulties are likely across the South Asia region, including slower growth in India, amid higher global interest rates and the ongoing effects of COVID-19. Pakistan is still reeling from devastating floods in August and September which left about a third of the country underwater. It has also been plagued by political instability since prime minister and former cricket star Imran Khan was deposed following an April no-confidence vote in parliament. Khan and his followers responded with a series of protest marches on the capital of Islamabad seeking to oust his successor, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Khan was wounded in a failed assassination attempt in November. A general election in Pakistan is due by October. Bangladesh, the world’s eighth most populous nation, will also hold elections this year. –  Matt Wade, senior journalist, former South Asia correspondent\\n North America Fresh from a polarising midterm election year, the United States will enter 2023 facing even greater political and economic uncertainty. Much of the first two years of Joe Biden’s presidency was spent trying to reach consensus in a Congress that his party narrowly controlled, but the next two years will involve navigating a newly divided government.\\n While the Democrats held on to the majority in the Senate at the midterms in November, Republicans won back the House of Representatives, giving them the power to thwart Biden’s agenda as he heads towards the next election in 2024. Expect to see plenty of acrimony as the new House works to undo some of the president’s legislative gains – such as higher taxes on corporations or big-spending climate change initiatives – while launching a flurry of probes on everything from the financial dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter, to the crisis at the US-Mexico border.\\n On that front, immigration will be a hot-button issue, as Americans brace for an explosion of migrants illegally crossing into the country seeking asylum. \\n Inflation will also remain a problem, with economists and financial experts predicting that higher prices will last well into the year, if not longer. The Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate rise in December also renewed the vexed question not even chairman Jeremy Powell can answer: will there be a recession in 2023?\\n Biden said he would decide early in the new year about whether to run for a second term – a move that seems increasingly likely amid reports that his wife and closest confidante, Jill Biden, has come around to the idea and is now “all in”.\\n Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been somewhat diminished after his coterie of extremist candidates ended up tanking at the midterms, and he still faces a string of legal woes, including the Justice Department’s probe into the January 6 Capitol attack and his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Nonetheless, history suggests it would be unwise to count “Teflon Don” out just yet. Expect a crowded field of primary candidates jockeying for the 2024 presidential nomination to emerge.\\n Meanwhile, in foreign affairs, the growing strategic competition between the US and China will inevitably challenge America’s alliance with Australia. The partnership was strengthened at the latest round of AUSMIN diplomatic talks in Washington in December, where the US announced it would integrate Japan into Australia’s military activities so that all three countries could push back on Beijing’s coercion in the Indo-Pacific. But the significant pledge came with very few details, so the proof, according to analysts, will be in the pudding. It’s going to be another fascinating 12 months. – Farrah Tomazin, North America correspondent\\n South and Central America The return of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to the helm in Brazil will likely mean a greater role for the country on the world stage, especially on climate change and protection of the Amazon. But first Lula will have to get past his inauguration on January 1 and fears of unrest by supporters of outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro, who has not yet accepted his election loss. Then Lula will need to govern around a Congress full of Bolsonaro-backed members and a divided population, half of which is still in denial over his victory.\\n Fresh from a FIFA World Cup victory, people in Argentina could be forgiven for temporarily forgetting the deep economic crisis the country is in, but the problems will persist at least until a planned October election, when current President Alberto Fernandez will likely be replaced by a leader from further to the right, if not the far-right, given the disenchantment with his administration.\\n Peru enters the new year in crisis after its peasant teacher-turned-president attempted a coup, was removed and arrested last month, and his supporters unleashed protests which culminated in the current state of emergency. New President Dina Boluarte has proposed elections in 2023, but the current climate gives her little room for policies to turn the economy around.\\n Venezuela’s economic crisis continues despite it having faded from the headlines. Strongman Nicolas Maduro survived Washington-backed efforts to remove him, but now the US appears to have gotten used to the idea he will be staying, certainly long enough to celebrate 10 years at the top this year. \\n Chile experienced one of the world’s fastest recoveries from the pandemic last year, growing 11.7 per cent, but an OECD report released in September and quoted by Reuters, expects this growth to slow to 1.9 per cent in 2023 due to growth in consumption, high inflation and the effects of the war in Ukraine.\\n El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua are all battling high crime and unemployment and are likely to continue to lose citizens to the promise of a better life in neighbouring nations and in the United States, presenting an enduring challenge for transit country Mexico and the Biden administration. - Lia Timson, deputy world editor\\n Middle East Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has proved a coin with two starkly different sides for the Middle East.\\n For oil and gas-producing nations, the energy crisis created by the conflict has resulted in a windfall as the world turns to them for fuel. US President Joe Biden, who had vowed to make Saudi Arabia a pariah for its human rights abuses, instead travelled cap-in-hand to Jeddah to urge increased oil production, only to be rebuffed. Even as the European Parliament is rocked by a only to be rebuffed, many European leaders have been anxious to avoid sanctions that might result in Doha withholding gas supplies to the continent.\\n But for those nations that import most of their food and fuel, the interruption in supplies of cereals and edible oils from Ukraine and Russia has put fresh strain on economies already struggling with severe youth unemployment, the COVID-19 pandemic and inflated food prices. Economic problems triggered the wave of uprisings in the Arab world in 2011, and the current mass protests in Iran, while aggravated by abuses of women’s rights, also had their origins in abuses of women’s rights for a population that is mostly under 30.\\n After one of the deadliest years since 2005 for Palestinians under occupation, Israel enters 2023 with a new government, led once again by with a new government, built around an assortment of far-right figures with long histories of incitement to violence and opposition to a two-state solution.\\n Yemen and Libya remain torn apart by war and Lebanon’s economy has collapsed completely. With the West’s attention turned elsewhere, a power vacuum has grown, and with it the prospect of renewed turmoil. - Maher Mughrabi, features editor, The Age\\n Oceania and the Pacific Across the Tasman, things will heat up for Jacinda Ardern as she gears up for an election year (a ballot must be called no later than January 13, 2024). Despite the Jacindamania that propelled her to New Zealand’s prime ministership in October 2017, the leader is facing a barrage of negative polls, worrying crime statistics and a fresher opposition. Having gotten through terror attacks, a pandemic and myriad problems in her first two terms, Jacindamania: tax cuts, childcare and support targeted to the working poor, writes the AAP’s Ben McKay.\\n Elsewhere in the Pacific, expect more jostling for political influence between China, the United States and Australia, especially in Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\\n Africa The outlook for the African continent is grim, with the Economist Intelligence Unit warning that “heightened geopolitical tensions, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing supply chain disruption, business and consumer price pressures, the rising cost of international and domestic finance, disruptive national elections, social grievances and adverse weather events are all present and will create an unsettled backdrop throughout 2023″.\\n Some 17 countries will hold state or parliamentary elections this year, including South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe. Ongoing conflicts in Mali and Burkina Faso, aggravated by the presence of al-Qaeda and Islamic State-affiliated terrorist groups, and food insecurity will pose grave threats.\\n A fragile ray of hope comes from Ethiopia, where a truce was struck in November to end a two-year war with Tigrayans in the north of the country, which also drew in Eritrea on the Ethiopian government’s side. The conflict killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and left millions more hungry and in need of aid. Last week, mediators were locked in negotiations in Tigray’s capital Mekelle, trying to advance the terms of the truce.\\n Morocco may be buoyed somewhat by the country’s unexpected brilliant performance at the FIFA World Cup, which has given the population reason to be cheerful despite it being knocked out in the late stage. \\n Meanwhile, China and Russia’s forays into the continent will continue – China via its mining and Belt and Road Infrastructure projects and Russia via the China via its mining who have, among other things, seized diamond mines and reinforced military government crackdowns. – Lia Timson\\n Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

He is flying into the hornet’s nest of an announcement crisis and putting his own security at peril.\\n But it is also an imaginative and bold move which may help to stop some of the bloodshed. At the very least, Biden’s commitment and gesture has to be applauded.\\n It is hard to think of a hot-headed Bush, a cautious Barack Obama or a crazed Donald Trump undertaking such a visit at a moment like this. Or who would have seen their duty in such bold terms. Few can now doubt the 80-year-old Biden’s determination to be re-elected.\\n The US president will be carrying not only a message of restraint for Tel Aviv, but will take in his teeth the green twig of humanitarian sensibility for the inhabitants of Gaza.\\n And in addition to sitting down with Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Biden will hold talks with King Abdullah II of Jordan, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Critically, at this stage, he is not meeting the Saudi Crown Prince or the leaders of the Gulf States.\\n Biden’s talks will emphasise that his objectives are not just to reassure Israel but to seek, however unlikely, some sort of peace in the region. He will also be saying there is no appetite in the US for escalation into a wider regional war.\\n The visit may yield no dividend but, as well as being able to wrap his caring arm around a traumatised Israeli psyche, Biden will be able to put the message to its new national unity government face to face that it risks alienating world opinion if its response to the ghastly Hamas attacks is disproportionate. A White House spokesperson said earlier that the United States “obviously doesn’t want to see any additional civilian suffering”.\\n Biden will arrive at a time when, with the Hamas attacks occurring over a week ago, there has been a pause by the Israeli leadership over Hamas attacks on a fraught ground invasion of Gaza. The situation has been in a holding pattern since the rapid massing of Israeli forces after the attacks.\\n All this comes as Australia’s prime minister Anthony Albanese is packing his bags for his state visit to Washington, to begin on Monday. There must be at least a partial shadow over whether it will now go ahead, though Washington will be loath to cancel it after Biden’s no-show at the Quad Leaders summit scheduled for Sydney last May.\\n Whatever happens, it underlines that Canberra’s interests must take their due place in the concerns of Washington.\\n Nothing could make that clearer than the priority Biden understandably gives the Middle East.\\n Having been itching to deal with the China challenge since the late 1990s, only to be distracted by 9/11 and wars in the Middle East, only since 2017 has Washington fully trained its policy eye on Beijing. But a superpower is always likely to be pulled into conflicts at every point around the globe – for Biden, first in Ukraine, now in the Middle East.\\n Viewing Washington’s current political atmosphere makes Biden’s task clearer. Trump is seeking to incite American anger at Muslims, uncaring of the possible costs. The US House of Representatives is still trying to sort out who its Speaker will be, and the Right, which may soon dominate the Republican majority in the House, is seriously thinking about disowning Ukraine. As Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping  meet in Beijing, Washington will only come under more pressure.

Around 800,000 of them manufacturing jobs. We’ve created more jobs in two years than any president created in a four-year term,” said Biden. “My predecessor is one of only two presidents in history who entered his presidency and left with fewer jobs than when he entered.”\\n Friday’s job report, though, offered a mixed package, showing US hiring ticking up but wage growth slowing and a higher unemployment rate. The White House event was the latest bid from Biden to tout his economic agenda, dubbed Bidenomics, ahead of next year’s election, with polls showing voters give his handling of the economy poor marks.\\n Biden has travelled the US in the past few months to highlight the impact of his policies on local communities but that pitch has largely fallen flat with voters still worried about lingering inflation and the threat of a softening jobs market. Biden on Friday said inflation over the past three months is closer to where it was before the COVID-19 pandemic and that incomes were higher.\\n August data showed US hiring picking up, with the number of non-farm jobs rising by 187,000 and topping forecasts. The figure includes a drop of 54,000 in the film and trucking industries, with the Hollywood writers’ strike and the bankruptcy of Yellow Corp, weighing on those numbers.\\n The labour market has raised hopes the nation may avert a recession at least in the near term. Hiring and incomes have been firm enough to bolster consumer spending. Still, Friday’s report offered fresh signs that hiring has not been as strong as previously reported. June and July payroll gains were revised lower by 110,000, following data last week.\\n Unemployment rose to 3.8 per cent, reflecting growing labour market participation. That in turn could help soften wage pressures. Average hourly earnings were up 0.2 per cent from July, the smallest increase since early last year, and up 4.3 per cent from a year earlier.\\n Friday’s data is the last jobs report the Federal Reserve will see before its policy meeting this month. Policymakers are expected to keep rates steady but chairman Jerome Powell has signalled interest rates could rise further should the economy and inflation fail to cool.\\n The economy remains a vulnerability for Biden in polls despite positive economic data in recent months, as recent data on a manufacturing boom, job gains, strong gross domestic product growth and easing inflation fail to resonate with voters.\\n At last week’s first Republican presidential debate, candidates on the stage lambasted Biden’s policies on the economy and vowed to undo them if elected.\\n Biden also faces fresh economic concerns with the United Auto Workers threatening a potential strike if they cannot reach a new agreement with Detroit’s legacy automakers. Last week, the union said its rank-and-file members had voted to authorise a strike against General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, maker of the Jeep and Chrysler brands, if a deal is not reached by a September 14 deadline.\\n Biden has said he is concerned about the prospect of a strike, urging both sides to reach a “fair” agreement.\\n The president also faces the risk of a government shutdown. Leaders in both parties on Capitol Hill say a stopgap spending bill will be necessary to avoid a partial shutdown after the current fiscal year ends on September 30, but conservative House Republicans are demanding spending cuts and restrictions on funding for Ukraine in exchange.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5cdei', 'headline': 'Biden’s own messy secret document saga is a gift to Trump', 'description': 'Washington: Joe Biden’s White House is in a mess of its own making.\\n A few weeks ago, Democrats were enjoying – with popcorn and all – the chaos of a Republican right-wing mutiny that popcorn and alland exposed a party that couldn’t get its House in order.\\n Now, the US president is embroiled in a classified documents scandal that is derailing his agenda, blunting his plans to announce another presidential run, and leaving his government on tenterhooks as a special counsel probes the matter.\\n Former president Donald Trump – under investigation over his own handling of classified documents – couldn’t have asked for a better gift.\\n First, some background in case you missed it. On November 2, six days before the US midterm elections, Biden’s personal lawyers unexpectedly found classified documents, from his time in the Obama administration, at the Penn Biden Centre think-tank in Washington, DC, where he had an office after his vice-presidential term.\\n While the records were handed back to the National Archives immediately, it took until January 9 for Biden’s lawyers to make this discovery public, and they only did so after media got wind of the story.\\n But even then, they omitted the fact that additional documents were also found in the garage of Biden’s home in Wilmington, Delaware, on December 20.\\n Indeed, it wasn’t until January 12, after further media reports, that Biden’s lawyers confirmed a “small number” of additional classified documents were found at two locations in the president’s home.\\n Also that day, as documents were being transferred to the Justice Department, another five pages with classified markings were discovered – but this wasn’t disclosed until last weekend.\\n Fundamental questions remain unanswered, driving Republicans and much of the US media into a frenzy.\\n What do the documents contain? Was national security compromised? Who had access to them? What drove the initial search at Biden’s old office in the first place? Why did the White House wait months to disclose the material had been found? Have there been any more searches?\\n To be sure, there are differences between Trump’s case and Biden’s: both in terms of the smaller number of documents in the president’s possession compared to Trump’s and the fact that Biden’s lawyers handed over the material as soon as they were found.\\n In contrast, Trump and his aides repeatedly resisted efforts to retrieve the documents stored at his Mar-a-Lago estate, which is precisely why the FBI took the extraordinary step of raiding his property in August 2022.\\n But the issue has become such a political headache for Biden that it’s drowning out the string of good news he wanted to use as a launchpad for his re-election bid: from cheaper gas prices and the slight easing of inflation, to his record of legislative accomplishments on infrastructure, manufacturing and renewable energy.\\n Now, not only have the Democrats lost the moral high ground over Trump’s handling of classified documents, the fact that Biden is also being probed by a special counsel opens up the possibility of more searches, more material being found, and more leaks.\\n This will give the new Republican House majority – whose leaders have already written to the White House demanding answers and set up a committee to probe the “weaponisation” of the Justice Department – further ammunition to play with.\\n Little wonder Biden is said to be furious about his less-than-ideal start to the year.\\n Part of the headache the president now faces comes as a result of the criticism he levelled at Trump over the classified documents seized by the FBI.\\n Asked during a 60 Minutes interview what he thought when he saw the now-viral photo of top secret documents laid out on the floor of Mar-a-Lago, Biden replied: “How that could possibly happen?\\n “I thought: what data was in there that may compromise sources and methods,” he added. “It’s just totally irresponsible.”\\n Part of it also comes to the White House’s own clumsy public relations strategy, which lacked transparency and made the president look like he had something to hide.\\n Indeed, as former Obama strategist David Axelrod told CNN: “The critical mistake was, in fact, the drip, drip, drip. The essence of crisis communications is: figure out where the story is going, get there as soon as possible, get there as thoroughly as possible.”\\n What happens next is anyone’s guess. While there is no evidence that Biden committed a crime, mishandling of classified documents is nonetheless a serious violation of US federal law.\\n Regardless of there being hundreds of documents (in Trump’s case) or just a “small number” (in Biden’s case), the Espionage Act states that anyone who “through gross negligence” allows sensitive material “to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed” could face a fine, a 10-year maximum jail term or both.\\n The latest documents saga is unlikely to reach that high bar, but the fact that a current and a former president are being investigated for potential violations of the act doesn’t exactly instil confidence in democratic institutions - no matter which side of politics you’re on.\\n Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

The president has a 58 per cent disapproval rating largely on his handling of the economy.\\n The president also faces a hostile Republican House majority that is forcing a high-stakes showdown over the nation’s debt limit and pledges to investigate his administration. For the first time, Mr Biden will deliver his speech with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy sitting behind him.\\n An estimated 38 million people are expected to watch his address, about one third of the total number set to tune into the Super Bowl this weekend. Even so, Mr Biden will, in effect, be launching his campaign for re-election.\\n Support for tougher China stance The president has to be careful not to boast of the economy doing too well as there was still a chance of slowing this year and the good jobs numbers reversing, said David Wessel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.\\n “The president will remind us, I’m sure, that the country has created 12 million jobs since he took office,” Mr Wessel said, “But I think he has to be careful for a couple of reasons. First, people don’t like to be told that they should be feel better than they do.”\\n “Second, chances are the economy’s going to slow from here. It would be very awkward for the president to boast about the economy – to declare mission accomplished – only to see the unemployment light rate rise in the months ahead and maybe even a recession.”\\n Mr Biden is also expected to signal a more hawkish position on China, especially in light of the China spy balloon fiasco that has created a fresh partisan flash point, with Republicans arguing the balloon flying over the US last week should have been downed earlier.\\n Increasing US concerns about China’s assertiveness meant a tougher stance would have wide support, said Brookings International relations expert Constanze Stelzenmüller.\\n “I think there is a bipartisan apprehension about Chinese assertiveness,” Ms Stelzenmüller said.\\n “He’s supported not just by much of his own party, and really large swathes of the GOP, who think he’s not being aggressive enough, but also by the labor unions.”\\n She said Mr Biden would probably reference the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS legislation, aimed at reducing reliance on China, and reviving semiconductor manufacturing in the US.\\n A new The Washington Post-ABC News poll showed this week that 58 per cent of Americans said they disapproved of Mr Biden’s handling of the economy.\\n The poll also found 58 per cent of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents would prefer someone other than Mr Biden as their presidential nominee – almost double the 31 per cent who support him. Only 22 per cent say Mr Biden should run again in 2024, down from 29 per cent last year.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5es38', 'headline': 'Democrats chose Biden because he could beat Trump. But that was then', 'description': 'Last week, President Joe Biden went deep on Donald Trump. “The greatest threat he poses is to our democracy, because if we lose that, we lose everything.” To laughter and applause, he then said, “He didn’t show up at my inauguration. Can’t say I was disappointed. I guess he won’t show up for the second inauguration.”\\n Behind the laughter, Democrats are worried there will not be a second Biden inauguration. It is reported that former president Barack Obama “feels that Democrats very well could lose” the 2024 election. reported are terrible. Biden’s approval is under 40 per cent. In key reported, Trump is leading. Of people who say they voted for Biden in 2020, only 87 per cent are saying they will do so today.\\n Trump has the enthusiastic support of 90 per cent of Republican voters. Biden has just 78 per cent of Democrats. Biden may well be impeached by Republicans in the House of Representatives over his son’s activities.\\n Yes, the economy is performing strongly. GDP growth is higher than the unemployment rate. But prices and cost of living pressures are up dramatically and, just like in Australia, interest rate cuts may be months away. This is why Biden, along with Prime Minister Albanese, have taken hits to their approval ratings.\\n Congress is baulking at urgent military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine and Israel. The foreign policy establishment is reeling from the prospect that Washington may fail to stand by these allies – the first time a president is so threatened by such a political setback since the fall of the Soviet Union.\\n The politics on these issues are invidious. On the aid package, there is this kicker from the Republicans: “Mr President, you want to protect Ukraine’s border? Well, our southern border with Mexico is out of control, and if you want the Ukraine aid we demand you keep asylum seekers out.”\\n The temperature on this is even hotter than the bitter debate in Canberra over detention orders following the High Court decision in November.\\n This issue is treacherous for Democrats. For Latino politicians and voters, a harsh Trump-style immigration law will fracture the party and Hispanic support for Biden.\\n The war and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza are also undercutting Biden’s support, especially among younger voters deeply alienated by Israel’s campaign.\\n Arab Americans are intensely angry over Gaza and Biden’s strong stand with Israel. In each of Michigan, Arizona, and Georgia, there are more Arab American voters than Biden’s 2020 margins of victory in those states. Most will not vote for Trump given his raw hostility to Muslims, but Biden is imperiled if they choose not to vote for him. If Biden loses those three states, and Trump keeps all the states he won in 2020, Biden will lose the election.\\n Despairing Democrats ask: can anyone take Biden’s place on the ticket? No, not unless he steps down voluntarily. Democratic leaders view Biden as a good president with solid achievements. Not one member of his cabinet or any senators or governors have stepped up to take Biden down.\\n But what if Biden, after securing re-nomination, has a freeze moment, and cannot speak for 15 seconds, or has a life-threatening illness and stands down from his campaign? What happens then?\\n The Democratic delegates elected during the primaries – Biden supporters – will gather in Chicago in August. What will they do? Go with Vice President Kamala Harris? Seek Biden’s divination of his successor?\\n In 2020, Democrats landed on Biden for one overriding reason: he was judged as the one with the best chance to beat Trump. If Biden retires in 2024, Democrats will choose the one they are most confident will beat Trump again. The field is likely to include Harris, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and California Governor Gavin Newsom, among others.\\n Will Biden or his successor face Trump, given all his legal trials? The first four Republican primaries, in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, will be done by the end of February. If Trump sweeps those contests, the nomination race is over.\\n In rejecting Nikki Haley, Republicans will lose their best chance of beating Biden. She would attract a swath of independent voters, like the teals do in Australia. Women would be energised to vote for the first female president. Haley is the perfect new vintage: Reagan values with Trumpist notes. She is not scary like Trump. No way would she Nazi talk like Trump about immigrants “poisoning the blood” of America or “poisoning the blood” as Trump has on the “rottenness” of America’s political system.\\n But it is virtually impossible for Haley to get there. Trump’s base is a movement. “When they indict me, they are indicting you,” he tells them. Trump says that if he is taken out, nothing will stop the radical Democrats and the “deep state” from killing their future. So when Haley attacks Trump, she is attacking his voters. That is why she cannot win against him.\\n By the Republican convention in July, Trump may be a convicted felon. If so, there will be an avalanche of calls for the party to remove Trump from the ticket. But like the Democratic convention delegates, the Trump troops are loyal to their general: no way they nail Trump’s political crucifixion.\\n Many across America and in Australia cannot understand how we have Biden and Trump when most voters do not want either of them or that choice. But here we are.\\n Bruce Wolpe is a senior fellow at the United States Studies Centre. He has served on the Democratic staff in the US Congress and as chief of staff to former prime minister Julia Gillard.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5dcui', 'headline': 'Why Trump is very likely to be the Republican nominee', 'description': 'A glitch-plagued chat with Elon Musk, live on Twitter, is an unconventional way to launch a presidential campaign. But with the entry of Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, the race for the Republican nomination is now properly underway.\\n The first states will not vote until January. Primaries are hard to predict, because it is expensive to conduct enough high-quality polls of primary voters in the key states. But, with that disclaimer over, one candidate has a huge, perhaps insurmountable, lead: Donald Trump.\\n Trump thus has a real chance of becoming America’s next president. Betting markets put his odds of returning to the White House at one in three. If you decided to pay less attention to Trump after he lost in 2020, to preserve your sanity, you may be wondering how this can be the case.\\n Parties do not usually stick with losers. Trump led the Republicans to defeats in the 2018 midterm and the 2020 presidential elections. After he encouraged his supporters to “stop the steal”, some of them broke into Congress, with the result that one police officer died of a stroke and four committed suicide. He has since been found liable for sexual assault, too. Would the Republican Party really nominate him again?\\n Yes, it probably would. In 2016 and in 2020 it made some sense to think of the Trump movement as a hostile takeover of the party. In 2023 it no longer does. He is the front runner because a large proportion of Republicans really like him. His supporters have had their hands on the Republican National Committee for six years now.\\n More than half of Republicans in the House of Representatives were elected for the first time since 2016, and therefore under Trump’s banner. Almost all of those House and Senate Republicans who refused to make their peace with him have stood down or retired. Of the ten House members who voted to impeach Trump in January 2021, only two are still there. They are outnumbered in their own caucus by more than 100 to one.\\n Trump’s campaign is also better organised than in either 2016 or 2020. Our analysis of the primaries shows how hard he will be to beat. He has a stunning lead: polling for The Economist by YouGov suggests Republican primary voters prefer Trump to DeSantis by 33 percentage points.\\n He also has a big lead in endorsements from elected Republicans, which are usually a good predictor of what will happen. In 2016, the last time Trump contested a primary, he won the early primaries with much less support than he has now.\\n Other candidates There are still Republican voters who would like an alternative – his 58 per cent poll share means that close to half of primary voters must be open to choosing someone else. Yet the difficulties of co-ordinating the opposition to Trump are daunting.\\n People close to the Trump campaign say privately that the more candidates who enter the primary, dividing the field, the better for their candidate.\\n Some big donors are giving money to non-Trump candidates on the condition that they drop out after South Carolina, an early primary, if told to do so. The idea is to engineer unity around a single non-Trump candidate, just as establishment Democrats united around Joe Biden in 2020 to stop Bernie Sanders, a leftist.\\n Backroom manoeuvring by party bigwigs is less likely to work against Trump, however, for the simple reason that he is the Republican establishment.\\n The way the primary calendar and pending legal cases against Trump intersect is nightmarish. His trial for falsifying records in New York will get underway shortly after Super Tuesday, when more than a dozen states vote. Neither this case nor any of the other investigations he faces are likely to be resolved by the time the primaries are over.\\n It is therefore possible that the candidate of one of the two great parties could be subject to criminal charges when he is on the ballot. America has had badly behaved presidents before. It has never had one who is also the defendant in a criminal trial.\\n Threat to democracy? You might think that, at this point, voters would abandon Trump in large numbers. Maybe. But when, earlier this year, a jury found that he had sexually abused a woman 30 years ago, the verdict had no measurable effect on his poll numbers. Trump, it turns out, is adept at persuading Republican voters that he is the real victim.\\n Democrats, and plenty of America’s allies, think Trump is a threat to democracy. His campaign is already turning this accusation back on the accuser: “The 2024 election”, a recent Trump campaign email announced, “will determine whether we can keep our Republic or whether America has succumbed to the dark forces of tyranny”.\\n Those who accept that these are the stakes will probably overlook Trump’s innumerable and obvious flaws. Imagine, then, that it is November 2024 and Trump and President Biden are having a rematch – the first since Dwight Eisenhower beat Adlai Stevenson back in the 1950s. Could Trump win?\\n The general election will surely be close. The electoral college gives Republicans a slight edge. The most recent landslide was 40 years ago. America has since become evenly divided politically and calcified because voters seldom switch sides.\\n Biden has some under-appreciated strengths, but he is no one’s idea of formidable. Were the country to enter a recession, Trump’s chances would go up. Some mooted post-primary tactics intended to stop him, such as running a third-party candidate, smack of desperation: they could easily backfire and boost him further.\\n All of which means that you should take seriously the possibility that America’s next president will be someone who would divide the West and delight Vladimir Putin; who accepts the results of elections only if he wins; who calls the thugs who broke into the Capitol on January 6th 2021 martyrs and wants to pardon them; who has proposed defaulting on the national debt to spite Biden; and who is under multiple investigations for breaking criminal law, to add to his civil-law rap sheet for sexual assault.\\n Anyone who cares about America, about democracy, about conservatism or about decency should hope that DeSantis or one of the other non-Trump Republican candidates can defy the odds and beat him.\\n The Economist\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5d7iu', 'headline': 'US debt showdown threatens Biden’s plans for Australia visit', 'description': 'President Joe Biden’s visit to Australia for the Quad meeting this month has been placed in doubt because of ongoing negotiations between the White House and the Republican Party in Congress over lifting the US debt ceiling.\\n Asked in a White House press conference if the debt ceiling debate could prevent him travelling abroad for the G7 meeting in Japan, a stop on the same trip to Australia, Biden said: “It is possible, but not likely.”\\n “In other words, if somehow we got down to the wire and we still hadn’t resolved this, and the due date was in a matter of - when I was supposed to be away, I would not go.

By law, the US government has to raise its borrowing limits to cover the $US31 trillion ($47 trillion) of government debt, driven up by robust infrastructure spending and services.\\n In a replay of past battles of the US debt, Republicans are using the impasse as an opportunity to extract cuts in spending from a Democratic presidency. Without congressional action to increase the limit, the US could default on its debt.\\n A default on the US federal government’s debt would be catastrophic for the US economy and financial markets and potentially trigger a global financial panic, threatening the US bond market’s status as the world’s safe haven and the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency.\\n Biden on Wednesday blasted Republican-demanded spending cuts as “devastating,” making his case in a campaign-style speech to voters as representatives met in Washington on raising the government’s borrowing limit to avoid a potentially catastrophic US default.\\n The president is showing an increased willingness to discuss possible budget restraints, yet he insisted anew that any talks on that should occur without the risk of the federal government being unable to pay its bills.\\n As he spoke, negotiators from the White House and Congress met for two hours privately at the Capitol to discuss a path forward.\\n “America is the strongest economy in the world, but we should be cutting spending and lowering the deficit without a needless crisis,” Biden said on Wednesday.\\n His words were a challenge to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who on Tuesday met Biden at the White House, declaring afterward that sharp spending cuts were required for House Republicans to increase the debt limit and stave off the risk of default.\\n Biden laid into that GOP proposal on Wednesday in Valhalla, New York, saying spending cuts recently passed by the Republican House could hurt schools and the country’s “sacred” obligations to military veterans.\\n The face-off comes as the government is rapidly bumping up against its legal borrowing authority, meaning that it may not be able to pay its bills as early as the start of next month unless Congress agrees to lift the limit.\\n Wednesday’s events marked a preview of what the coming 18 months will look like for Biden as he performs his presidential duties while also trying to campaign in the 2024 election.\\nHe went to a region represented by first-term Republican Representative Mike Lawler, whose district Biden won in 2020.

About 30 kilometres will be fenced along the Rio Grande that separates Mexico from the US.\\n “The bottom line is President Biden lied to the American people.”\\n The policy shift was also met with anger by members of Congress, who demanded the administration reverse the decision and come up with meaningful immigration reform.\\n “You could build a great big Trumpy wall on the entire US southern border and it’s still not going to fix this problem,” New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram.\\n “The US and US foreign policy is contributing to this problem, and if we do not address the migrant crisis at its root, it is still going to be a problem.”\\n Common Defence – America’s largest grassroots organisation of military veterans, which represents 200,000 veterans, military family members and civilian supporters – agreed.\\n “We should be creating safe pathways for people instead,” the group’s climate justice director Perry O’Brien told this masthead.\\n “We are deeply disappointed and think that this is just playing into the hands of defence contractors and the xenophobes on the far-right who want to turn the southern border into our next forever war.”\\n The backflip underscores the political and policy challenge that Biden – who has had about 6 million asylum seekers detained or intercepted under his watch – faces ahead of next year’s election.\\n According to a recent Gallup poll, his overall approval rating sits at a low 42 per cent, but Americans view his performance on immigration to be much worse, at 31 per cent.\\n While building a border wall was one of Trump’s signature policies, Democrats have traditionally taken a more cautious approach to immigration.\\n However, the White House has hardened in recent months, coinciding with Republican governors sending scores of migrants to Democratic cities such as New York, Chicago and Washington to goad the president over the crisis.\\n Biden sought to defend the decision again on Friday (Saturday AEDT), telling reporters at the White House that he had wanted Congress to redirect the funds towards other measures, such as more border patrol agents or drug-detecting capabilities.\\n However, the money had been appropriated by Congress in 2019, when Trump was still in power, specifically for the construction of the wall.\\n “I was told that I had no choice,” Biden said.\\n Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

Donors, grassroots, apparatchiks, potential candidates and the man himself should have settled on, if not an individual, then a process for choosing one while governing.\\n Instead, more out of inertia than calculation, the party is set to put a man who looks each and every one of his 81 years through the kind of gruelling nationwide campaign that lockdowns spared him in 2020.\\n If he had a George HW Bush or even an Al Gore as vice-president, Biden’s frailty might not be so off-putting to voters. And so to the Democrats’ second unspinnable problem. Harris is out of her element at this level of electoral politics. She was the first candidate of note to quit the last presidential primaries. Those who outlasted her included the mayor of Indiana’s fourth city. Pointing these things out when Biden selected her was, among liberals, thankless work.\\n Again, the instinct of Democrats is to lose themselves in comms-speak about the need to “relaunch” her, to give her issues to “own”, as though this were a gauche but high-potential rookie and not a person closing in on 60.\\n Harris is about as good a politician as she will ever be, which mightn’t be quite good enough. That, given the actuarial odds that she will assume the highest office on Earth one day, is a fundamental problem, not a presentational snag.\\n There is something of the Versailles court about the Democratic elite. Politesse matters. People walk on eggshells around obvious losers.

Second: the job of beating him should go to the default candidates, to avoid an internal fuss. But their ratings are dire? Ah, what are you going to do.\\n There is something else the Democrats can’t spin or present their way out of: the material experience of voters. Any president who oversaw high inflation would be in electoral trouble.\\n But one who had passed vast spending bills, to which those price rises could be plausibly (even if speciously) attributed, should be doomed. It is a measure of Trump’s unattractiveness, and of public disquiet at the Republican erosion of abortion rights, that Biden is still competitive.\\n The Democrats’ main error since 2020, after the lack of succession planning, was to attempt an economic overhaul for which there was more demand from commentators than voters.\\n Biden’s big-government reforms have been likened to Lyndon Johnson’s, even Franklin Roosevelt’s, but both those presidents won landslides. Biden’s win was smaller than either of Bill Clinton’s. It was never enough for an epochal rupture with “neoliberalism”.\\n He should have been a transitional president whose ultimate service was removing Trump.

The American people deserve to know that public offices are not for sale.\\n “Through our investigations, we have found that President Biden did lie to the American people about his own knowledge of his family’s foreign business dealings.”\\n The move comes after Mr McCarthy faced mounting pressure from allies of former president Donald Trump within the Republican Party to target Mr Biden more aggressively, or risk being ousted from his own leadership role.\\n The Republicans will try to prosecute Mr Biden following witness testimony that he used his influence through phone calls and other interactions resulting in millions of dollars in payments to his son, his son’s business partners and other members of the Biden family.\\n Hunter Biden’s business dealings The House Oversight Committee found last month that when Mr Biden was vice president, the Biden family and business entities related to his son Hunter Biden received more than $US20 million ($30 million) in payments from foreign entities, including from Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs.\\n It also found that Mr Biden used pseudonyms in private emails with his son and business associates to conceal allegedly corrupt activity with foreign leaders.\\n The White House said there was no basis for an investigation. The move sets the stage for months of divisive hearings in the House that could supercharge the 2024 election race, in which Mr Trump hopes to win back the White House from Mr Biden. The hearings could also take public attention away from multiple criminal indictments against Mr Trump ahead of the poll.\\n “Extreme politics at its worst,” White House spokesperson Ian Sams wrote on social media.\\n Three presidents have been impeached in the past, along with one cabinet secretary and one senator, among only 21 impeachments in the US, although more than 60 impeachment investigations have been conducted.\\n Mr Trump is the only US president to have been impeached twice, in 2021 and 2019.

So, Fitch’s black mark against the extreme political dysfunction and division in the US translated into only a limited reaction on global bond markets despite some instant wobbling in sharemarkets.\\n That’s even though the US Treasury announced it would boost the size of its quarterly sale of long-term debt next week by slightly more than expected and US bond yields and the cost of capital may remain slightly higher for a while at least.\\n Sharemarket nerves are more a reflection of fears the resilience of the US economy will mean the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates higher for longer. Yet continued strength of the US economy combined with rapidly falling inflation is still encouraging confidence in Washington that all the predictions of a coming recession later this year – including by Fitch – may not come true. There have certainly been plenty of expert economic forecasts getting it wrong over the last few years.\\n But the muted response on financial markets also reflects the dramatically transformed politics and economics of public debt in the US. The Clinton era of budget surpluses and rhetoric about the responsible balance between spending and taxing seems far more distant than even the closing years of the 20th century.\\n Despite recurring dramatic showdowns in Congress over the US debt limit, neither Republicans nor Democrats care enough about the size of the ballooning deficit to adopt any serious change of approach.\\n That’s even though a world of sharply rising interest rates means interest paid on US debt this year is expected to be close to $US700 billion ($1.07 trillion) – 50 per cent larger than estimates of corporate tax revenue.\\n Last June’s deal to suspend the debt limit until 2025 – conveniently after the election in November 2024 – will supposedly cut federal spending by $US1.5 trillion over a decade, freeze non-defence spending next year and cap it to 1 per cent growth in 2025.\\n But neither party wants to touch the big-spending programs like Medicare and social security, which are set to expand even faster as the population ages and more Baby Boomers retire. Democrats also want to further expand some entitlement programs for various groups, while Republicans rail against any tax increases to pay for the spending surge over the last several years. They prefer the Trumpian formula of big tax cuts supposedly paying for themselves.\\n In Fitch’s view, the “repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management” while the government lacks a medium-term fiscal framework.\\n “These factors, along with several economic shocks as well as tax cuts and new spending initiatives, have contributed to successive debt increases over the last decade,” it stated.\\n None of this will deter either Congress or the Biden administration from continuing down the high-debt path.\\n A Trump-influenced Republican Party as well as the Democrats have far less faith in the traditional market-based virtues of free trade, free markets and deregulation. The notion of small government has been seriously out of fashion for many years, exacerbated by COVID-19. But the agenda of the 2020s is more radical.\\n Polarisation Even though bitter polarisation between Republicans and Democrats has only escalated in intensity on social issues, what is less obvious is their considerable common ground on the economy.\\n This is based on the belief in the need for greater national protectionism and self-sufficiency rather than traditional US support for globalisation and the benefits of leaving it to the market.\\n The Biden administration has more than doubled down on Trump’s Make America Great Again complaints about losing US manufacturing jobs and industries to unfair competition from China. Trump’s anti-China tariffs only went part of the way.\\n Biden is championing public investment and a focused industrial policy to develop economic self-reliance as well as new industries. The Inflation Reduction Act is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to lure domestic and global investment in renewables technology and products made in America. The equally big spending Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2021 to rebuild ageing infrastructure is spreading money and jobs throughout the US heartland.\\n The possibility of a second Trump administration would dangerously destabilise and further divide the US, terrify US allies and lead – at best – to an erratic, unpredictable White House. And that’s without an external crisis suddenly dwarfing all other considerations.\\n But whether Biden or Trump go on to win, the domestic policy direction of massive subsidies and tax breaks to boost jobs and industries is unlikely to change. It’s the supersized version of buy now, pay later.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5ce6d', 'headline': 'Think Biden is too old to run for president again? No, he’s feeling sprightly', 'description': 'There is growing expectation in Washington that, in coming weeks, President Joe Biden will announce that he will seek a second term in the White House.\\n It is only because of Biden’s age that there has ever been any doubt about whether he would run again. The president turned 80 on November 20; were he to serve another term he would be 86 when he left office in January 2029. Yet, health permitting, there is no reason not to expect him to do so.\\n Since the 22nd amendment to the US Constitution which imposes a two-term limit on the Presidency came into force in 1951, every incumbent American president has sought a second term. Six have been successful: Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, George W Bush and Obama. Four have failed: Ford, Carter, George H W Bush and Trump. Lyndon Johnson is difficult to classify: he was re-elected in 1964 having been in office for a year following the Kennedy assassination. Although ultimately he did not run again in 1968, he had every intention to do so, and only withdrew when he was pushed close to defeat in the New Hampshire primary. Kennedy himself made his fatal trip to Texas in November 1963 to lay the foundations for his re-election bid in 1964, which he would almost certainly have won.\\n Nevertheless, no incumbent has been as old as Biden. Will his age make the difference? Subject, always, to the caveat of his health, I doubt it. In Australia, we are accustomed to the idea that even long political careers end in their 60s (if not earlier). Not so in the United States.\\n When considering whether Biden would see his age as an impediment, it is instructive to consider the institution which shaped him: the US Senate. It was designed by the framers of the Constitution to be a body of wise elders (hence the Constitution prescribes a minimum age limit of 30). The etymology of the very word “Senate” is the Latin “senex” (old man). When Americans say “elder statesmen”, they really mean it. It is not uncommon for senators to serve into their 80s, in some cases their 90s.\\n Among the senators elected in last year’s mid-terms was Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, commencing his eighth six-year term at the age of 89. (Grassley has served continuously in elected office, as a State legislator, Congressman and Senator since he was first elected to the Iowa House of Representatives in 1959.) Biden served in the Senate with Grassley for 28 years. His other former Senate colleagues included Orrin Hatch of Utah (who retired after 42 years at the age of 86), Ted Stevens of Alaska (who also served for 42 years until he reached 87), Daniel Inouye of Hawaii (who died in office in 2012 at the age of 88, a fortnight before his 50th anniversary), and Dianne Feinstein of California (incumbent, who turns 90 in June and has not ruled out running again in 2024). But the greatest of them all – at least in terms of longevity – was the legendary Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who died in June 2003 at the age of 100, having retired from the Senate only five months earlier after 48 years’ service. Thurmond began his public life in the South Carolina Senate in 1933; his continuous political service lasted one week short of 70 years.\\n Had Biden not been tapped by Obama in 2008 to be his running-mate, he would very likely still be the senior senator for Delaware – and, like those and others of his senatorial colleagues, he would no doubt be planning to continue. Biden’s long service as a senator is key to understanding his future plans, because we are all shaped by the institutions in which we have our careers. In Biden’s case, it is the Senate, where age confers status, longevity enhances power, and being an octogenarian is no problem at all.\\n Add to that the fact that politics is all Biden has ever done. He was first elected to the Senate half a century ago, in 1972. He was just 29; he was only constitutionally eligible because his 30th birthday fell between his election and the start of his term. He has been a senior political figure ever since. The only time in the last 50 years he has not held elected office was during the Trump presidency; during those four years he devoted himself full-time to running for president.\\n Many US presidents come to the office having made their name outside politics: Wilson (university president), Eisenhower (general), Reagan (film star), the first Bush (businessman) and Trump (property developer and television “personality”). Quite a few have come to Washington from Governor’s mansions: FDR, Carter, Reagan, Clinton and the second Bush. Biden is not one of those. He has no interesting professional hinterland. His entire professional life has been spent as a Washington insider. Nor does he appear to have any interests outside politics: he is an entirely one-dimensional inside-the-Beltway politician.\\n Historical precedent, institutional culture and life story aside, there is one other powerful reason why I expect Biden will decide to run again. He believes he can win. Should he decide to run, he is unlikely to face a primary challenger. Kamala Harris, foisted upon him by the Obamas and generally considered the least effective vice president since Dan Quayle, is no threat at all, nor is any other senior Democrat.\\n With the nomination in the bag, he will face one of three scenarios: his opponent will either be Trump, a Trump surrogate, or a Republican who beats the Trump machine. If it is either of the first two, the mid-terms give Biden every reason to be confident of winning. If it is the latter, expect the MAGA Republicans to run a spoiler candidate to destroy the official nominee’s chances, just as George H W Bush’s re-election was derailed in 1992 by the insurgent campaign of Ross Perot.\\n As he surveys the wreckage wrought upon the Republican Party by Donald Trump, Joe Biden must scarcely be able to believe his luck. And if ever, in a nostalgic moment, he casts his eye down Pennsylvania Avenue towards the institution which shaped him and in which he served for more than half his adult life, he must feel positively sprightly.\\n George Brandis was a Senator for Queensland from 2000 - 2018 and Leader of the Government in the Senate in the Turnbull Government.\\n The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own.

What about a sex abuse finding?', 'description': 'At the outset of his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump famously said, “I could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and not lose any voters.” Today, after being“I could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and not lose any voters.”, Trump can say, “I can beat a rape charge and even sustain conviction of a witch-hunt phoney hoax sexual assault charge on Fifth Avenue, and not lose any voters.”\\n Carroll is very courageous. We know from experience here, with Jarryd Hayne’s case and Jarryd Hayne’s case, how searing and arduous it is for women to obtain a conviction after alleging that they were raped. That a jury substantially believed Carroll about events she related from 30 years ago is proof that justice can prevail.\\n But Trump is somehow able to defy political gravity that would claim other mortals. No chief executive of a listed company in the United States can keep his job if even an accusation of sexual impropriety is made. Just two weeks ago, the head of NBC Universal was forced to resign for an “inappropriate relationship” with a woman in the company. Trump, the former president who was impeached twice, and who is facing further criminal proceedings from New York to Georgia to Washington DC on charges of corrupting political and electoral processes, is not only still in the game to return as the Republican presidential nominee – but is the frontrunner today. It is astonishing.\\n Trump has one playbook: deny, defame, discredit. Never admit, never concede, never retreat. Always appeal. Right after the verdict, Trump posted that the court proceedings were a “disgrace” and a “witch-hunt” comprised of Democratic Party justice from Democratic prosecutors and a Democratic judge in the Democratic city of New York. America’s politics are so infested with rancid hyper partisanship that even deeply scarred candidates for the House and Senate who lie about their careers or who are accused of sexual assault are not denied a place on the ballot by Republican voters.\\n This is the political currency Trump has minted and spends with abandon to keep control and to keep winning. What Trump is in jeopardy of losing, however, is his ability to win back independent voters – the equivalent of teal voters in Australia – in the suburbs around major cities across the country. Moderate voters are absorbing the Carroll judgment. Together with Trump’s extremism on guns, abortion rights and culture war issues, swing states and swing House and Senate seats come into play for the Democrats.\\n Trump’s Republican opponents for the presidential nomination are dying to beat him but, so far, they are unwilling to decisively break with him – because they could lose support from the Trump base if they do. As Peggy Noonan, one of Ronald Reagan’s most gifted advisers and writers, wrote last week: “He’s never been the focus, onstage, of a serious, capable, sustained assault on policy or comportment. No one on his side has ever challenged him to his face on how and why he failed as president. No one knows if he could take it. He doesn’t know. To defeat Mr Trump, you have to attack him. But here, they say, is the problem: If you attack Mr Trump, his base will never forgive you.”\\n Trump leads his principal opponent, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, 51 to 25 per cent. If DeSantis or anyone else wants to take the Republican nomination away from Trump, they will have to take him down. They will have to convince Republican voters in the primaries next year that Trump is unfit to be president, that Trump will lose to Biden and that Trump will keep the Republicans from winning full control of Congress – which is what Trump failed to do in 2018, 2020 and 2022.\\n President Joe Biden is running for re-election for two principal reasons: to “finish the job” he started in his first term of rebuilding America and delivering jobs and more economic security, and defeating Trump again to preserve America’s democracy.\\n Biden believes he can do it. But can he? A shock Washington Post – ABC News poll last weekend sent tremors through the Democrats. Trump is leading Biden 47 to 42 per cent. Forty-four per cent of US adults say they will definitely or probably vote for Trump; only 38 per cent for Biden. Only 32 per cent think Biden has the mental sharpness, at age 80, to do the job. Fifty-four per cent think Trump, at 76, is able. Nearly 60 per cent of Democratic-leaning voters wish another person was the nominee. Biden has an approval rating of just 36 per cent – the lowest of his presidency.\\n Today’s verdict in New York nevertheless does open the character issue on Trump once again. Together with any further indictments in the weeks ahead, this will crystallise the issue of whether Trump can be a full-time president or a full-time defendant.\\n Today, Trump feels he can stroll down Fifth Avenue, saunter into Bergdorf Goodman, and say they will be happy to have such a famous customer shopping again in their store.\\n And the media will be all over it. \\n The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own.

Mr Biden is ahead only in Wisconsin, by 2 percentage points, the poll by The New York Times and Siena College found.\\n Across the six battlegrounds – all of which Mr Biden carried in 2020 – the president trails by an average of 48 per cent to 44 per cent.\\n Although the polling is worrisome for the president, Mr Biden still has a year to campaign, which his team emphasised on Sunday (Monday AEDT). They noted that polls have historically failed to predict the results of elections when taken a year ahead of time.\\n “Gallup predicted an eight-point loss for President Obama only for him to win handily a year later,” said Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for Mr Biden’s campaign. “We’ll win in 2024 by putting our heads down and doing the work, not by fretting about a poll.”\\n Still, the results of the poll, and other recent surveys showing similar results, are prompting public declarations of doubts by Democrats.\\n David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who has expressed concerns about Mr Biden before, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the new polling “will send tremors of doubt” through the party.\\n “If he continues to run, he will be the nominee of the Democratic Party. What he needs to decide is whether that is wise; whether it’s in HIS best interest or the country’s?”\\n Multiracial groups doubt Biden Discontent pulsates throughout the poll, with most voters saying Mr Biden’s policies have personally hurt them. The survey also reveals the extent to which the multiracial and multigenerational coalition that elected Mr Biden is fraying.\\n Demographic groups that backed Mr Biden by landslide margins in 2020 are now far more closely contested, as two-thirds of the electorate sees the country moving in the wrong direction.\\n Voters younger than 30 favour Mr Biden by only a single percentage point, his lead among Hispanic voters is down to single digits, and his advantage in urban areas is half of Mr Trump’s edge in rural regions. And while women still favoured Mr Biden, men preferred Mr Trump by twice as large a margin, reversing the gender advantage that had fuelled so many Democratic gains in recent years.\\n Black voters – long a bulwark for Democrats and for Mr Biden – are now registering 22 per cent support in these states for Mr Trump, a level unseen in presidential politics for a Republican in modern times.\\n Add it all together, and Mr Trump leads by 10 percentage points in Nevada, 6 in Georgia, 5 in Arizona, 5 in Michigan and 4 in Pennsylvania. Mr Biden held a 2-point edge in Wisconsin.\\n In a remarkable sign of a gradual racial realignment between the two parties, the more diverse the swing state, the further Mr Biden was behind, and he led only in the whitest of the six.\\n Mr Biden and Mr Trump are both deeply – and similarly – unpopular, according to the poll. But voters who overwhelmingly said the nation was on the wrong track are taking out their frustrations on the president.\\n Mr Biden still has a year to turn the situation around. Economic indicators are up even if voters do not agree with them. Mr Trump remains polarising. And Mr Biden’s well-funded campaign will aim to shore up his demographic weak spots. The president’s advisers have repeatedly noted that Democrats successfully limited the party’s losses in 2022, despite Mr Biden’s poor approval ratings at the time.\\n For Mr Biden, who turns 81 later this month, being the oldest president in American history stands out as a glaring liability. An overwhelming 71 per cent said he was “too old” to be an effective president – an opinion shared across every demographic and geographic group in the poll, including a remarkable 54 per cent of Mr Biden’s own supporters.\\n In contrast, only 19 per cent of supporters of Mr Trump, who is 77, viewed him as too old, and 39 per cent of the electorate overall.\\n This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5egxz', 'headline': 'Netanyahu is an albatross around Biden’s neck', 'description': 'Lawyers are taught never to ask a witness a question to which they do not know the answer. That logic also applies to wartime alliances.\\n US President Joe Biden has hitched his fortunes to a man — Benjamin Netanyahu — who is co-creator of the ghastly dilemma with which Israel is now faced. The problem with Biden’s bear-hug strategy is that he has no veto on the Israeli prime minister’s actions.\\n The tool Biden wields is influence. Everything about Netanyahu suggests that behind-the-scenes suasion is not a method that works.\\n Were it not for Israel’s discredited leader, Biden’s strategy would be reasonable. Israel feels wounded and threatened; public hectoring by its chief supporter in Washington would only deepen that sense of isolation; that in turn would raise the likelihood that Israel would take blind measures that would further damage its security.\\n Unfortunately, that is happening anyway. Biden’s well-intentioned case is already being belied by Israel’s actions.\\n White House officials say Biden’s pressure has led Israel to restore internet services to Gaza and permit a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the enclave. It is also possible the Israel Defence Forces would have entered Gaza sooner and in a more heavy-handed way than is happening. Counterfactuals are hard to prove.\\n Biden’s staff say his approach is working even though it will be hard to convince the world of that. But their rationale is deteriorating. The case for a sterner Biden approach is made by Netanyahu nearly every day. Last week, Netanyahu cited the prophecies of Isaiah in defence of the coming war.\\n This was a biblical reference to God’s protection of the Jewish people. It also served as a dog whistle to Netanyahu’s allies in America’s evangelical movement. One of them, Mike Johnson, is now speaker of the US House of Representatives.\\n Two-state solution Such talk from Israel’s leader and America’s de facto leader of the opposition deprives Hamas of its dark monopoly on theocracy. In a social media post since deleted, Netanyahu talked of a war between “the children of light and the children of darkness”.\\n From Biden’s point of view, such imagery is disastrous. More than 3000 Palestinian children are estimated to have died already and that toll is set to grow.\\n But in crisis there is opportunity. Biden has reiterated that America’s goal remains the two-state solution. On the theory that it is darkest before dawn, Hamas’ barbaric slaughter and Israel’s retaliatory actions have reinforced the case that only a Palestinian state can guarantee Israel’s security.\\n The alternatives – a binational secular state, or the status quo – can respectively be dismissed as fantasy and unacceptable. Yet Netanyahu’s life work has been about making the two-state solution impossible.\\n One of the reasons Israel’s security services were caught napping on October 7 is because the IDF’s forces were focused on the occupied West Bank. Over the past two years the territory has endured its worst violence since the end of the second intifada in 2005, as Israeli troops have launched almost daily raids.\\n So combustible is the situation in the West Bank that the IDF was nowhere to be found when Hamas unleashed its unspeakable terror. That negligence belongs to Netanyahu.\\n By some measure, Netanyahu is Israel’s worst leader. But Biden does not have the luxury of waiting for history’s verdict. Israel’s military plan to remove Hamas has to be linked to the political settlement that will come afterwards. Netanyahu stands in the way of Biden’s two-state goal.\\n Assuming it is feasible, can eliminating Hamas be done in a way to increase Palestinian support for a non-violent alternative? Who will administer Gaza?\\n The likelihood is that Israel’s levelling of parts of Gaza, pressuring Egypt and other Arab states to take its 2.2 million people as refugees, and then retreating behind a more fortified garrison, will only increase Palestinian support for extremism. Israel’s next battle front would then be the West Bank.\\n This is where Biden’s approach could turn to disaster. Unless he can pressure Netanyahu into an improbable change of heart, Israel is set to proceed with what will look to the world like collective punishment, even if it takes every precaution to minimise civilian deaths.\\n Biden will be held responsible. Those who know Biden, rightly say his approach is sincere. It is also effective politics against a Republican Party that is urging biblical revenge on the Palestinians. But that does not make it wise. Like a good lawyer, Biden needs to control his witness. Yet Netanyahu answers to nobody but himself.\\n While Netanyahu remains, Biden’s presidency is hostage to a man who will never repay the favour.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5c9td', 'headline': 'After the storms of 2022, we should expect a calmer 2023', 'description': 'There are two things we like to do at the beginning of a new year. First we like to make a series of New Year’s resolutions that are almost impossible to keep. And secondly, we tried to predict what will happen in the following year. So every year starts off with this difficult-if-not-fruitless exercise!\\n Let’s start with this year’s predictions. And just to put that into some context, my predictions for 2022 were good but not great! I didn’t think China would invade Taiwan and I thought in time China would realise the errors of its wolf-warrior diplomacy and start to soften its attitude to the outside world. That proved to be right. I thought there would be inflationary pressures coupled with rising interest rates coming from the $14 trillion of extra global spending in response to the COVID-19 crisis. That prediction turned out to be right.\\n Where I was wrong was this: I thought President Vladimir Putin would be too cautious to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. My prediction was that if he did, he would get bogged down there for years to come and be subjected to expensive and damaging western sanctions. Common sense suggested Putin wouldn’t want that fate. As it turned out, Putin was more foolish and reckless than I had imagined! But I was right, he did get bogged down in Ukraine!\\n So what about 2023?\\n Let’s start with Ukraine. My prediction is that Putin’s troops will remain bogged down there throughout the year. There will be no lasting peace agreement because there is not a rational basis for such an agreement. Russia would have to be prepared to withdraw from all the territory it has occupied in Ukraine for President Volodymyr Zelensky to think an agreement was acceptable to the Ukrainian public.\\n What will this mean for the global economy? It will gradually adjust to life without Russian oil and gas supplies and that is already happening. Many predict that the current easing of oil and gas prices is a temporary lull but I’m not sure. It seems to me a gradual increase in production of gas outside of Russia will help keep prices more stable than they have been over 2022.\\n But expect interest rates to remain either at or slightly above current levels because although global inflation may ease during 2023, it will still remain a problem.\\n After all, the great COVID-19 panic that led to an estimated $14 trillion being spent on COVID-19 related measures worldwide will take a long time to wash through markets. Don’t believe incumbent politicians when they tell you inflation and rising interest rates as a function of the Ukraine war. That had some impact, but the core cause lies in the massive COVID-19 spending binge and quantitative easing by central banks. And in Australia, don’t expect Albo to stop the binge.\\n Politically, 2023 is likely to be a more stable year than 2022. The only election in Australia of great interest will be the NSW state election. That will be hard for the Liberal Party to win, but anything is possible.\\n Internationally the only elections of real interest will be the Turkish presidential election which is likely to be won, by hook or by crook, by the incumbent president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Nigeria has a presidential election. That doesn’t register in the Australian media, but Nigeria is by far the most populous country in Africa, and it matters. The incumbent president is retiring because of term limits, so this will be an election to watch as it will have implications for the stability and prosperity of Africa.\\n In the US, two things will become clear: will President Joe Biden recontest the presidency in 2024, and will Donald Trump still be embraced by a majority of Republicans to contest the 2024 election?\\n Many think Biden will contest the presidency on the grounds that he is the Democrat with the best chance of winning. I’m not sure. He would beat Trump (again), but if the Republicans have any sense – and in recent times they’ve shown collectively a lack of sense – then they will run one of the other attractive candidates available such as Ron DeSantis of Florida or Nikki Haley.\\n By the end of the year, it will look as though President Biden is no longer credible as a candidate for 2024 and Republicans will realise that Trump could never again win a presidential election. This will trigger excited analysis of whom the new next candidates for the Democrats and the Republicans are going to be in the 2024 presidential election.\\n Morally repugnant racists There will, of course, be black swan events in 2023: negative events (natural or man-made) which will have significant global consequences, and they are by definition entirely unpredictable. But globally, 2023 is likely to be a calmer year than 2022 or the years before which were consumed by the great COVID-19 panic.\\n As for New Year’s resolutions, perhaps all Australian public figures could commit to using more civilised arguments as we deal with one very contentious issue: the referendum on the Indigenous Voice to parliament.\\n This will inevitably arouse passions on both sides and it will be a test of goodwill and national maturity if participants in the debate can restrain from accusing each other of being morally repugnant, racists and even worse.\\n I find it very hard to make a prediction about how that referendum will go. I imagine as the moment gets closer and the debate gets hotter support for the Voice will start to decline particularly if people become uncertain about what it really will entail.\\n A wiser approach would be to legislate the Voice and see how it works and then, if it runs as smoothly and elegantly as its proponents say, put it to a referendum.\\n As for other national issues, let’s hope the name-calling can be dispensed with.\\n Denigrating Australia’s greatest sportsman, Don Bradman, as a racist and a “nut job” because he voted Liberal in the 1975 election, which most people did, was a new low in national discussion. I assume Phillip Adams, who led that abuse, now realises he has damaged his own reputation.

For people in rural areas, that figure is 66 per cent.\\n In July 2021, Biden famously rebuffed inflation warnings, saying “there’s nobody suggesting there’s unchecked inflation on the way – no serious economist”.\\n The comments proved not only wrong but damaging to his electoral credibility as inflation soared to the highest level in 40 years.

That’s a lot less than the increase in the White House’s Independence Day barbecue checklist.\\n “Hot dog, the Biden economic plan is working.

Strawberries have continued to rise, with two punnets costing $US13.98, up from $US10 last year.\\n Two pounds of ground beef jumped to $13.98 this year, up from $8.98 last year. The cost of two pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breast kept rising to $US13.98 this year, up from $US11.98 in 2022 and $US6.74 in 2021.\\n A pound of sliced cheese held steady at $US4.30, down from $US4.32 in 2022, but up from $US4.05 when the White House used the US Farm Bureau to compile its analysis.\\n The cheapest bag of eight hamburger buns cost $2.19, much cheaper than the $US3 last year, but still up on $US1.66 in 2021. And there was some refreshing relief, with the price of lemonade down to $3.38 this year, from $4.80 last year.\\n With consumer prices still sticky, economists such as former Treasury secretary Larry Summers believe the Federal Reserve will need to keep lifting interest rates further to dampen economic activity and further ease inflation.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5el77', 'headline': 'Biden’s ‘prick’ insult to Democrat loyalist a sign of his decline', 'description': 'David Axelrod is not a prick.\\n Truly.\\n I’ve known him since 2007 and if I had to pick a noun to describe him, it would be mensch.\\n So when President Joe Biden privately employs that epithet for Axelrod, according to Politico’s Jonathan Martin, it’s bad for a few reasons.\\n The ordinarily gracious president is punching down at the strategist who helped elevate him onto the ticket with Barack Obama in 2008 and who thinks he was “a great vice president” and has done a lot of wonderful things as president.\\n When some in the Obama camp chattered in 2011 about switching Biden out for Hillary Clinton, Axelrod said, he protested: “That would be an incredible act of disloyalty to a guy who has done a great job for us.”\\n Surely, Biden does not want to lower himself to the vulgarity of the growling, brawling, thieving Republicans in the Hieronymus Bosch hellscape of our Congress.\\n (As Seth Meyers noted, George Santos, who spent campaign money on Hermès, Ferragamo, Botox, Sephora and OnlyFans, had “the shopping list of a 98-year-old oil tycoon’s 20-year-old wife”)\\n Trump’s ahead Axelrod drew Biden’s ire because he urged the president to consider stopping at one term, throwing open the race to younger Democrats while there’s still time, and leaving as a hero.

I remember Hillary doing that, too.”\\n The president’s flash of anger indicates that he may be in denial, surrounded by enablers who are sugarcoating a grim political forecast.\\n Like other pols, Biden has a healthy ego and like all presidents, he’s truculent about not getting the credit he thinks he deserves for his accomplishments.\\n And it must be infuriating that most of the age qualms are about him, when Trump is only four years younger.\\n Mar-a-Lago Dracula No doubt the president is having a hard time wrapping his mind around the idea that the 77-year-old Mar-a-Lago Dracula has risen from his gilded coffin even though he’s albatrossed with legal woes and seems more deranged than ever, referring to Democrats with the fascist-favoured term “vermin” and plotting a second-term revengefest. Trump’s campaign slogan should be, “There will be blood”.\\n For Biden, this is about his identity. It’s what he has fought all his life for, even battling his way through “friendly fire,” as Hunter Biden told me, in the Obama White House, when some Obama aides undermined him. It must have been awful when Obama took his vice president to lunch and nudged him aside for Hillary to run in 2016. Biden craves the affirmation of being re-elected. He doesn’t want to look like a guy who’s been driven from office.\\n But he should not indulge the Irish chip on his shoulder. He needs to gather the sharpest minds in his party and hear what they have to say, not engage in petty feuds.\\n If Trump manages to escape conviction in Jack Smith’s Washington case, which may be the only criminal trial that ends before the election, that’s going to turbocharge his campaign. Of course, if he’s convicted, that could turbocharge his campaign even more.\\n It’s a perfect playing field for the maleficent Trump: He learned in the 2016 race that physical and rhetorical violence could rev up his base. He told me at the time it helped get him to No. 1, and he said he found violence at his rallies exciting.\\n He has no idea why making fun of Paul Pelosi’s injuries at the hands of one of his acolytes is subhuman, any more than he understood how repellent it was in 2015 when he mocked a disabled Times reporter.\\n He gets barbaric laughs somehow, and that’s all he cares about. In an interview with Jonathan Karl, Trump gloated about how his audience on January 6 was “the biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken in front of by far.”\\n Never mind that it was one of the most dangerous, shameful days in our history. To Trump, it was glorious.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5d38s', 'headline': '‘Finish the job’: Biden announces 2024 re-election bid', 'description': 'Washington DC | President Joe Biden formally announced he will run for re-election in 2024, with only a slightly higher approval rating at this point in his presidency than Donald Trump had with his at the same time.\\n Mr Biden, who would be 86 at the end of a second term, faces a smooth path to winning his party’s nomination, with no serious Democratic rivals, but will likely take on Republican Trump in a rematch of the 2020 election.\\n Mr Biden’s announcement on Tuesday night (AEST) came in a three-minute video that received just 39,000 hits in the first four hours.\\n In the announcement, which came on the four-year anniversary of when he declared for the White House in 2019, President Biden asks voters to give him more time to “finish the job” and to set aside their concerns about extending the run of America’s oldest president for another four years.\\n His message made frequent references to Republican extremists and Mr Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan with images of the January 6 attack on the Capitol building.\\n “Around the country the MAGA extremists are lining up to take on bedrock freedoms, cutting social security that you paid for your entire life while cutting taxes for the wealthy,” Mr Biden said.\\n “I said we are in a battle for the soul of America, and we still are. The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer.”\\n While the question of seeking re-election has been a given for most modern presidents, that’s not always been the case for Mr Biden, as a notable swath of Democratic voters have indicated they would prefer he not run.\\n The latest polling from FiveThirtyEight shows Mr Biden’s approval rating among Americans is only 43 per cent, slightly above the 41 per cent Mr Trump had at this stage in his presidency, but higher than the rock-bottom polling Mr Biden had last US summer when his approval fell below 40 per cent.\\n Mr Biden’s political standing within his party stabilised after Democrats showed a stronger-than-expected performance in last year’s midterm elections. His improvement in polls also has a strong correlation to the falling rate of inflation which has been top of mind for voters.\\n The president’s campaign launch message, however, was strongly focused on personal freedoms and democracy, not the strength of the economy which many believe could enter recession this year.\\n “Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There’s nothing more important. Nothing more sacred,” Mr Biden said in the launch video.\\n “This is not a time to be complacent,” he added. “That’s why I’m running for re-election.”\\n Mr Biden, speaking over brief video clips and photographs of key moments in his presidency and flashes of his outspoken Republican foes, including Mr Trump, Florida governor Ron DeSantis, and conservative politician Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, exhorted supporters that “this is our moment” to “defend democracy”.\\n A strong record Mr Biden’s first appearance after the launch was at the Washington Hilton, where he addressed the North America Building Trades Union, discussing how his investing in America’s agenda is bringing manufacturing back, rebuilding the middle class, and creating good-paying union jobs.\\n Mr Biden is likely to campaign on strong jobs growth under his watch as well as his first two years as president combating the coronavirus pandemic and pushing through $US1.5 trillion ($2.3 trillion) in legislation on infrastructure, high-tech manufacturing and climate measures.\\n With Republicans now in control of the House, Mr Biden is still keen to make sure voters credit him for the big spending legislation, despite a showdown with Republicans over raising the nation’s debt ceiling.\\n The president also has multiple policy goals and unmet promises from his first campaign that he’s pitching voters on giving him another chance to fulfil.\\n “Let’s finish this job. I know we can,” Mr Biden said in the video, repeating a mantra he said a dozen times during his State of the Union address in February, listing everything from passing a ban on assault-style weapons and lowering the cost of prescription drugs to codifying a national right to abortion after the Supreme Court’s ruling last year overturning Roe v Wade.\\n Mr Biden also plans to point to his work over the past two years shoring up American alliances, leading a global coalition to support Ukraine’s defences against Russia’s invasion and returning the US to the Paris climate accord. But public support in the US for Ukraine has softened in recent months, and some voters question the tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance flowing to Kyiv.\\n The president faces lingering criticism over his administration’s chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, which undercut the image of competence he aimed to portray to the world, and he finds himself the target of GOP attacks over his immigration and economic policies as well hypocrisy over his handling of classified documents in his private residence, which he had earlier chastised rival Trump for doing.\\n The oldest president Biden is acutely aware of voters’ concerns about his age.\\n “Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,” Mr Biden said in March 2020, as he campaigned in Michigan with younger Democrats, including now-Vice President Kamala Harris, 58. “There’s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.”\\n Mr Biden, on multiple occasions, has brushed back concerns about his age, saying simply, “Watch me.”\\n To prevail again, he will need to revive the alliance of young voters and Black voters — particularly women — along with blue-collar Midwesterners, moderates and disaffected Republicans who helped him win in 2020, while protecting his position in Georgia and Arizona, longtime GOP strongholds that he narrowly won in his last campaign.\\n Mr Biden is not expected to dramatically alter his day-to-day schedule as a candidate and if he follows the Barak Obama playbook, he may not hold any formal campaign rallies until well into 2024. Mr Obama didn’t hold a re-election rally until May 2012.\\n Presidents typically try to delay their re-election announcements to maintain the advantages of incumbency and skate above the political fray for as long as possible while their rivals trade jabs. But the leg up offered by being in the White House can be rickety — three of the last seven presidents have lost re-election, most recently Mr Trump in 2020.\\n With AP\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5e7vw', 'headline': 'Inside the plan to stop Biden falling over before election', 'description': 'President Joe Biden has been wearing tennis shoes and having physiotherapy as part of a plan to stop him falling over before the election, according to reports.\\n Concerns over Biden’s age have become a thorn in the side of his re-election campaign and his team are understood to be fearful another tumble could shatter his November 2024 hopes – especially if it happens weeks before voters go to the polls.\\n News of the precautions emerged as the 80-year-old became the first president in modern history to join a picket line on Tuesday, as he spoke to striking workers protesting low pay in the car manufacturing industry.\\n In what historians called an “absolutely unprecedented” move, Biden told members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) trade union in suburban Detroit to “stick with it” and hold out for “a significant raise and other benefits”.\\n The industrial action, and battle for union support, have become political flashpoints in the 2024 campaign, which has also seen questions raised over Biden’s fitness for re-election come to the fore in recent months.\\n In June, Biden tripped and fell over a sandbag at the US Air Force Academy graduation in Colorado.\\n The moment was quickly seized on by his Republican rivals.

Hamas branded the allegations “false”.\\n Asked about the president’s remarks, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House took “very, very seriously the need to be as factual and certainly as truthful as we can possibly be”.\\n But he also said the public should not lose sight of the bigger picture: “The utter depravity and the barbaric nature with which these terrorists murdered and butchered innocent Israeli civilians.”\\n ”And that further underscores why – and this is what the President’s specific point was – that we’ve got to stay with Israel,” Kirby added. “We’ve got to continue to make sure they have the support that they need.“\\n The administration’s full-throated backing of Israel is hardly surprising given the parallels to the 9/11 terrorist attack and the fact that Americans are among those killed and believed to be taken hostage by Hamas.\\n But Biden’s relationship with Israel also dates back decades. He first visited the country as a young senator in 1973 and often tells the story of an hour-long gathering with then-prime minister Golda Meir, which he has described as “one of the most consequential meetings” he’s ever had.\\n And as a president whose life has been steeped in tragedy – his first wife Neilia and their 15-month-old daughter Naomi were killed in a car crash in 1972; his eldest son Beau died of cancer four decades later – the horrors of the Holocaust also resonate.\\n In fact, one of Biden’s most powerful moments during the roundtable meeting with Jewish leaders last week was when he recounted how he would bring each of his children to the Dachau concentration camp in Germany after they turned 14.\\n “I wanted them to see!” he yelled, suddenly pounding the lectern in front of him as he shook with emotion. Some of the leaders in the room froze in response; others choked back tears.\\n The Israel-Hamas war now presents one of the most complicated geopolitical situations of Biden’s presidency.\\n It undercuts his campaign for normalisation between Israel and Saudi Arabia, adds another unwanted war to his list of pre-election challenges, and deepens divisions in an already fiercely fractured America.\\n With so much at stake, adding to the disinformation and misinformation surrounding the conflict doesn’t help.\\n Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

He said Denver applied to the federal government for a further $US11 million to meet the ongoing demand, but had only received $US900,0000.\\n “We’re at the breaking point, particularly with regards to resources in terms of capacity and space, as well as money,” Hancock told MSNBC.\\n And in New York, more than 4200 asylum seekers arrived in the past week alone, according to Mayor Eric Adams’ office. The city has already taken in about 65,000 new arrivals who await immigration court hearings, housing many of them in Manhattan hotels that used to cost tourists about $US400 a night, but  have since been converted into emergency relief shelters.\\n However, with room running out, Governor Kathy Hochul has called on President Joe Biden to identify federal land to house asylum seekers, such as military or naval spaces, or federally owned fields and reserves.\\n Adams, meanwhile, is pushing to house some migrants at hotels further north, in Rockland County and Orange County. However, this sparked outrage and legal threats from local officials, and in the case of Rockland Country, also resulted in a temporary restraining order being issued.\\n “Quadrupling the number of homeless in this county overnight, as the city is intending to do, will only compound our housing crisis and lead to more people living in these dangerously inhumane conditions that we are fighting to fix,” Rockland County Executive Ed Day said in a statement.\\n America’s immigration system has been under strain for years, but the issue came to the fore last week when Title 42, which allowed authorities to swiftly expel people at the border in order to stop the spread of COVID 19, ended at 11.59pm on Thursday night (US time).\\n Ahead of the policy being lifted, thousands of people from South and Central America surged to the border that separates Mexico from the US, resulting in an average of 10,000 crossings a day into Texas towns such as El Paso and Brownsville.\\n Department of Homeland Security spokesman Blas Nunez-Neto said that figure has since dropped to an average of 5000 per day, although the situation was “still very fluid” and could rise again at any time.\\n Processing centres where people generally stay before being released back into the community and onto “sanctuary cities” were still at capacity. Sanctuary cities, such as New York, Denver and DC, are so called because they protect those seeking to migrate.\\n The border is one of the biggest challenges in the US, largely due to global shifts in migration caused by economic and political decline across many South and Central American nations, such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.\\n But with 18 months until the next election, the issue has become a political powder keg for Biden, who has had about six million asylum seekers detained or intercepted under his watch – more than any other president in history.\\n He also came to office halting construction of his predecessor Donald Trump’s border wall and suspended a Trump-era policy requiring some asylum seekers to be sent back to Mexico to await immigration proceedings.\\n Last week on CNN, Trump suggested that, if he returns to the White House next year, he may reintroduce his “zero tolerance” family separation policy, which resulted in thousands of children being separated from their parents at the border.\\n Some remain separated due to the lack of record keeping processes at the time.\\n “Well, when you have that policy, people don’t come. If a family hears they’re going to be separated, they love their family, they don’t come,” Trump told CNN host Kaitlan Collins.\\n One of the main problems underpinning the broken immigration system is that there is no efficient and effective pathway to help people seek asylum, leaving many in a state of limbo.\\n While many of the people who cross the border are fleeing poverty, violence, or authoritarian rule in their own country, the process of getting through the courts to validate their claims can take months, if not years.\\n And for much of that time, they aren’t allowed to legally work (although many find “unauthorised” employment to make ends meet).\\n Ilze Thielmann is one of many volunteers who have been greeting migrants since they started showing up at New York’s Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, after being bused from border states such as Texas, Arizona or California.\\n She said desperate people were always going to come to the US in search of a better life; therefore governments should do what they can to help them get work sooner.\\n “We’re always going to keep seeing people coming in, so the city, the federal government and the state really need to step up and take responsibility,” she said.\\n Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

He was energetic, in command of his message and determined to speak to the American people.\\n At times throughout his 72-minute speech, he even looked like he was having fun goading Republicans as they heckled him, in defiance of their leader.\\n Speaker Kevin McCarthy had earlier cautioned his members to behave, telling them in a closed-door meeting that the “mics are hot” and the cameras were likely to pick up their every move. Clearly, they didn’t care.\\n Last year’s address drew a prime-time audience of about 38 million Americans. This one, the first since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, the stakes were even higher.\\n But despite the partisan divisions on clear display, Biden struck a more cooperative tone, calling on his adversaries to work with him in the interest of the nation: on gun reform, on border security, on the fentanyl crisis.\\n “To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress,” he said.\\n “The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere... We’ve been sent here to finish the job!”\\n Finishing the job is a big ask in a divided Congress. And with less than two years until the next presidential election, the clock is ticking.\\n Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

Another said that Washington is “sinking [its] own boat”.\\n From the left, former foreign minister Bob Carr said it showed that “Australians have been enormously gullible and optimistic about our American partner”.\\n “Act like a client state, get treated like one,” Carr warned.\\n From the right, The Australian columnist Peter Jennings linked the decision to what he regards as the Albanese government’s lacklustre defence funding. “That type of complacency garners no presidential visits when other priorities are pressing.”\\n These criticisms are overblown, overwrought and, in some cases, simply wrong.\\n Of course, it’s a shame that President Biden isn’t visiting next week. The image of the leaders of the United States, India, Japan and Australia assembling at the Sydney Opera House would have been a coup for Anthony Albanese and a show of solidarity by four democracies in the face of China’s challenging behaviour.\\n Biden’s speech to the Australian parliament would have been a notable moment in the history of the alliance.\\n More significantly, his visit to Port Moresby would have been the first by a sitting president to a Pacific Island country and a chance to finalise the new US-PNG security agreement.\\n So, Washington has missed an opportunity this week. But let’s keep things in perspective.\\n In America’s messy and disaggregated political system, the executive doesn’t control the legislature. Biden’s top priority in the coming week is to prevent the US government from defaulting on its debt, which would cause global financial instability and undercut American economic leadership. Biden judged that his presence in Washington was required to avoid that outcome. Should he have taken a chance with the global economy in order to save our blushes?\\n Americans need to take care that their domestic problems don’t spill over into foreign policy. But Biden’s cancellation is not a symptom of post-imperial decline. Bill Clinton cancelled a trip to APEC to avoid a government shutdown in 1995, when America was in the full flush of its unipolar moment.\\n Neither is it a sign of presidential “frailty”. Biden is a serious political figure and a potent foreign policy president.\\n In 2020, Biden did America’s allies a great service by marching the appalling and dangerous Donald Trump out of the White House.\\n His administration has responded to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine with strength and subtlety. It has brought consistency to the US relationship with China. Last week, Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spent two days in Vienna talking sense to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.\\n The White House’s decision does not “raise questions about the reliability of the United States as a regional ally”, as political editor of The Australian Financial Review Phillip Coorey reported on Thursday. \\n On the contrary, Biden has restored America’s regional alliances after the trauma of the Trump years. He has deepened diplomatic and defence links with Japan.\\n Last month, he closed a deal with the president of South Korea to counter the nuclear threat from Pyongyang and prevent Seoul from pursuing its own nuclear deterrent.\\n This month, Biden hosted Ferdinand Marcos jnr – the first Philippines president to visit the Oval Office in a decade – and reinvigorated US-Filipino military ties.\\n It was Biden who first convened the Quad countries at the leaders’ level. Hopefully, the four leaders will now meet in Hiroshima and advance the Quad’s agenda.\\n What about Australia? As part of AUKUS, Biden agreed to share one of America’s most advanced technologies – its naval nuclear propulsion system – to enable us to build a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.\\n This is a “big bet” on Australia, Jake Sullivan told the Lowy Institute in 2021. “We trust you, we believe in you. And we believe even more importantly in our collective combined capacity to produce greater stability, security and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region.”\\n Some commentators seem to have a case of nerves. They should take their lead instead from the Australian public.\\n Over the course of nearly two decades of Lowy Institute polling – and even at the depths of the misbegotten Iraq war – strong majorities of Australians have seen the US alliance as “very” or “fairly” important for Australia’s security. In the 2023 Lowy Institute Poll, which will be released next month, eight in 10 (82 per cent) continue to see the alliance as important to our security. One presidential no-show won’t change that long-held view.\\n The US presence in Asia gives structure to the region, which would otherwise be dominated by one giant authoritarian power. Through our active diplomacy in South-East Asia and the Pacific, as well as through the alliance, AUKUS and the Quad, Australia is contributing to a stable balance of power.\\n Nothing has changed this week. The sky remains in place.\\n'}, {'asset_id': 'p5e8bq', 'headline': 'The US needs a good president, and Biden’s been good for us', 'description': 'It’s true: Joe Biden is not a young man. Ideally, candidates for high political office should be in the prime of their lives. But, there is an unbalanced quality to the debate about Biden’s age.\\n For starters, it’s odd that there is more media coverage of Biden’s fitness for office than that of his predecessor Donald Trump, who has now been indicted four times, including for the subversion of American democracy.\\n We should judge Biden on his performance. He has been an effective leader, especially on foreign policy and particularly when viewed through the prism of Australia’s interests.\\n The first argument for Joe Biden is Donald Trump. In 2020, Biden burst the big fat orange Trump balloon – the only time Trump has been defeated in a national election.\\n Unlike Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, Ron DeSantis and all the other supposed Trump-slayers, Biden took care of business.\\n In so doing, Biden did a great service to us all. Trump was bad for the United States, undermining its institutions and turning Americans against each other. But he was also bad for the rest of the global West.\\n The interests of the world’s democracies are served when the US is well-governed, cohesive, appealing and strong. During the Trump presidency, America was poorly governed, divided, ugly and weak.\\n In office, Biden has been a foreign-policy president of the first rank. The biggest international shock since the end of the Cold War has been Russia’s brutal, immoral and illegal invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration responded with a masterclass in statecraft and alliance management, using intelligence to knock Vladimir Putin off balance and dispatching vast flows of military equipment, training and aid to Kyiv.\\n Along with Britain, the European Union, Australia, and other nations, the US has supplied democracy’s arsenal. Of course, it is Ukrainians, with their immense moral and physical courage, who are serving as democracy’s bodyguard.\\n Biden’s policies have helped to weaken Putin’s regime and strengthen NATO. Eighteen months ago, Putin was seen as a geopolitical chess grandmaster. Now the frailties of authoritarian governments are more obvious, as are the qualities of democracies.\\n In the Indo-Pacific, Biden has created a situation of strength. In less than three years, the president and his skilful foreign policy team have consolidated Washington’s Asian alliances, brought Japan and South Korea closer together, quickened America’s connections with India and Vietnam, stood up AUKUS and convened the Quad – even as they have stabilised the US-China relationship.\\n Take America’s Asian alliances, which constitute Washington’s key comparative advantage over China. Trump threatened repeatedly to withdraw US forces from the Korean peninsula; this year Biden reached an agreement with the South Korean president to counter the nuclear threat from Pyongyang and prevent Seoul from pursuing its own nuclear weapon.\\n In August, Biden brought together the leaders of South Korea and Japan at Camp David. He is helping to unpick the historical enmities between Seoul and Tokyo that have impeded co-operation between these two key Asian allies.\\n Trump’s grisly bromance with former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte didn’t stop Duterte from courting China. In May this year, by contrast, Biden hosted Duterte’s successor Ferdinand Marcos Jr in Washington – the first such visit in a decade – and renewed US military ties with Manila.\\n Biden has brought together the leaders of the Quad countries, including treaty allies Japan and Australia as well as India.\\n He has signed up to AUKUS, by which the US and the UK are assisting Australia to develop a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.\\n Many experts argue that given the size and location of the Australian continent, nuclear-powered boats make sense for us. They will provide immense capability in terms of lethality, speed, range, and stealth. These submarines will give Australia significant deterrent power. They will help us to deter rash actions by adversaries and contribute to the strategic equilibrium in our region – if we carry through with the plan successfully. It will be a big lift for us.\\n The Biden administration has also worked hard to maintain a stable relationship with China, despite Beijing’s bluster.\\n In the aftermath of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, critics claimed that America had lost interest in its allies, and its allies had lost confidence in America. NATO’s solidarity on the issue of Ukraine, and the establishment of AUKUS, are conclusive defences against both charges.\\n Biden is a fine president whose policies have favoured Australia’s interests. There is no compelling alternative Democratic candidate to Biden. Trump is the likely GOP nominee for president next year. His return to the White House would be a nightmare for Australia and the West.\\n Let’s keep these facts in mind when we make judgments on fitness for office.\\n Michael Fullilove is the executive director of the Lowy Institute.\\n Get a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own.

The cartoon uses caricature, humor, and symbolism to critique the perceived hypocrisy of the situation.\\n\\n**Composition and Visual Elements:**\\n\\nThe cartoon is divided into two distinct sections, with Trump on the left and Biden on the right.  A large, ornate gold frame, reminiscent of a doorway or picture frame, separates them.  This frame bears the Presidential Seal of the United States and the acronym \"POTUS\" (President of the United States), symbolizing the office and its inherent power and responsibility.\\n\\n* **Donald Trump:** Trump is depicted shirtless, wearing a crown and a pink, fur-trimmed jacket.  His exaggerated physique, with a large belly and small hands, is a common caricature used in political cartoons. He is wrapped in numerous strips of paper labeled \"CLASSIFIED,\" \"ASSIFIED,\" and variations thereof. These strips are strewn around his feet and trail behind him, creating a visual representation of the classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort. He holds a red-and-white striped staff, possibly alluding to a circus ringmaster or a jester\\'s scepter, further emphasizing the cartoon\\'s mocking tone.  A speech bubble above Trump\\'s head reads, \"OOH!! THE HYPOCRISY… ANOTHER WORD I INVENTED. BTW,\" satirizing Trump\\'s frequent claims of being unfairly targeted and his tendency to coin or misuse words. A small heart-shaped patch on his jacket reads \"Moi,\" a French word for \"me,\" highlighting his perceived self-centeredness. A tattoo on his torso reads \"Me, the People,\" a distorted version of \"We, the People,\" the opening phrase of the U.S. Constitution, mocking Trump\\'s populist rhetoric.\\n\\n* **Joe Biden:** Biden is depicted in a dark suit and sunglasses, a more conventional representation of a president.  He appears to be tiptoeing away from a strip of paper labeled \"CLASSIFIED,\" also trailing from the POTUS frame.  Above Biden\\'s head are the words \"C\\'MON MAN,\" a common phrase he uses. This suggests a more cautious and perhaps embarrassed response to the discovery of classified documents in his possession.\\n\\n* **The POTUS Frame:** The frame acts as a central dividing point between the two figures, symbolizing the presidency and the shared responsibility for handling classified information. The documents trailing from the frame towards both Trump and Biden imply that both are implicated in the mishandling of classified materials.\\n\\n* **The Background:** The background is a washed blue, possibly representing the turbulent political climate surrounding the issue.  The loose, watercolor style adds to the cartoon\\'s informal and satirical tone.\\n\\n**Meaning and Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe cartoon\\'s central theme is hypocrisy, specifically regarding the handling of classified documents.  It highlights the seemingly contradictory positions of Trump and Biden, both of whom have faced scrutiny for possessing classified materials after leaving office.\\n\\n* **Trump\\'s Portrayal:** The cartoon portrays Trump as brazen and unapologetic about the classified documents found in his possession.  His crown and the scattered documents suggest a disregard for the rules and regulations surrounding classified information. The speech bubble further emphasizes this, with his claim of inventing the word \"hypocrisy\" coming across as ironic given the situation.\\n\\n* **Biden\\'s Portrayal:** Biden\\'s depiction is more subdued, suggesting a degree of embarrassment or an attempt to downplay the situation. His tiptoeing and the smaller number of documents associated with him imply a lesser degree of culpability, but the cartoon still implicates him in the mishandling of classified information.\\n\\n* **The Overall Message:** The cartoon\\'s juxtaposition of Trump and Biden emphasizes the perceived hypocrisy of both sides of the political spectrum. It suggests that while the specifics of each case may differ, both figures have ultimately failed to uphold the standards expected of those who have held the highest office in the land. The cartoon invites viewers to consider the broader implications of the issue and the potential double standards applied to political figures based on their affiliations.\\n\\n**Target Audience and Purpose:**\\n\\nThe cartoon is likely aimed at a politically aware audience familiar with the classified documents controversies surrounding both Trump and Biden. Its purpose is to satirize the situation and provoke reflection on the political climate and the handling of classified information. The cartoon\\'s humorous and exaggerated style makes it accessible to a wider audience, while its underlying message encourages critical thinking about political accountability.\\n\\n\\n**Keywords for Retrieval:**\\n\\n* Political cartoon\\n* Donald Trump\\n* Joe Biden\\n* Classified documents\\n* Hypocrisy\\n* Presidential Seal\\n* POTUS\\n* Satire\\n* Caricature\\n* Watercolor\\n* Political commentary\\n* Mar-a-Lago\\n* C\\'mon man\\n* Double standard\\n* Political accountability\\n\\n\\nThis extended description provides a detailed analysis of the cartoon\\'s visual elements, meaning, and intended audience, making it easier to retrieve the image based on relevant keywords and themes.\\n'}]\n",
