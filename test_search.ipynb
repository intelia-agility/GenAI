       "     'value': {'string_value': 'HOLLYWOOD\\nBurn It Down: Power, Complicity and a Call for Change in Hollywood \\nMaureen Ryan\\nHarperCollins, $60\\n Maureen Ryan is as mad as hell about what’s been happening in Hollywood. And the Vanity Fair contributing editor has written Burn It Down to tell readers why. “What should be assessed is not just the creative product, its financial cost, and its efficiency (or lack thereof),” she writes, “It’s also how productive and nurturing an environment it is.” Something that she goes to great lengths to explain isn’t happening now and never has been.\\n Her book, which deals mainly but not exclusively with the world of television, was written before the recent strikes by the American Writers and Screen Actors Guilds and doesn’t deal directly with the specific issues that have provoked them. But it does point to a range of resentments that have been simmering away for years, to do with how workplaces that ought to service the needs of employees have frequently become hellholes.\\n To most readers, much of this won’t come as a surprise. Hollywood has long been infamous for what was once seen as routine behaviour but is now regarded as disreputable. The public testimonies of the courageous survivors of sexual assaults by men in powerful positions have exposed some of the darker activities hidden behind the surface gloss of the American film business.\\n Ryan mentions in passing that she herself suffered this fate at the hands of an unnamed TV executive. She wrote at some length about it in Variety in October 2017, and her smouldering anger about what happened permeates the book.\\n Drawing on the experiences of a young actress, she even goes so far as to liken what goes on in Hollywood to the way cults conduct themselves. “How is a cult that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day all that different from a set (or a workplace) that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day?“\\n Her overall approach is messy, featuring long-winded attempts to explode myths about the Hollywood business, most of which were blasted to smithereens long ago. But she also provides compelling, detailed accounts of the failures and moral breakdowns that have occurred behind the scenes on the long-running series, Lost (2004–2010) and Sleepy Hollow (2013–2017), and that (contrary to the view that emerges, fictionalised, in Curtis Sittenfeld’s irresistible novel, Romantic Comedy) allegedly continue at NBC’s Saturday Night Live, the late-night sketch comedy show that has been around for almost half a century, and elsewhere.\\n Some of her sources allow her to use their names; others choose to remain anonymous whistleblowers, fearful of the consequences for their careers if they become known as troublemakers. She manages to get a few of those accused – “the sinister forces in the shadows” – to go on the record with their responses, but most ignored her requests for interview.\\n Stories abound of nightmare situations arising in writers’ rooms, on sets and in private offices, around racism, sexism, homophobia, inequitable returns for efforts, and the systemic abuse of those without power. Ryan’s crusader-like passion sometimes leads to overkill, the litany of sins that she uncovers providing more examples than required to make her points when a more selective approach would have been more effective.\\n But it does mean that many of those that the system has turned into victims do get an opportunity to have their voices heard, even if only as “Joyce” or “Hannah”, or any of the other names she attaches to those who wish to avoid reprisal.\\n Ryan is especially illuminating in her examination of some of the disturbing developments at Saturday Night Live. In this context, she cites journalist Seth Simons’ astute but unfashionable notion that stand-up comedians have long occupied a space for an ugly culture, one “where it has been OK to be a horrible person” (a point that becomes especially pertinent in the light of the coverage of Russell Brand’s transgressions).\\n In the final section of the book, acknowledging that there’s no magic fix for the problems she’s identified, Ryan proposes several ways in which it might be possible to repair “the damage created by allowing toxic people – and systems – to run amok”.\\n She quotes The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer about the best way to go about it: “The hope for a more equitable, democratic and prosperous society does not lie with enlightened corporations but with organised workers.” And, in line with this, she points to the need for writers, actors and others to work together to establish grassroots alliances and respectful workplaces in which to do their creative work.\\n She ends by explaining that she’s no revolutionary, that she doesn’t actually want to burn Hollywood down. What she really wants is a business equivalent of a “prescribed burn”, one that can help prevent a wildfire. “Fire can be rejuvenating,” she writes, creating a neat analogy courtesy of National Geographic. “It returns nutrients to the soil … and can help young trees and other plants start to grow.”\\n Burn It Down sometimes labours its points, but the urgency with which Ryan champions her cause is both affecting and effective.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

She wrote at some length about it in <em>Variety</em> in October 2017, and her smouldering anger about what happened permeates the book.</p> <p>Drawing on the experiences of a young actress, she even goes so far as to liken what goes on in Hollywood to the way cults conduct themselves. “How is a cult that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day all that different from a set (or a workplace) that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day?“</p> <p>Her overall approach is messy, featuring long-winded attempts to explode myths about the Hollywood business, most of which were blasted to smithereens long ago. But she also provides compelling, detailed accounts of the failures and moral breakdowns that have occurred behind the scenes on the long-running series, <em>Lost</em> (2004–2010) and <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> (2013–2017), and that (contrary to the view that emerges, fictionalised, in Curtis Sittenfeld’s irresistible novel, <em>Romantic Comedy</em>) allegedly continue at NBC’s <em>Saturday Night Live,</em> the late-night sketch comedy show that has been around for almost half a century, and elsewhere.</p> <p>Some of her sources allow her to use their names; others choose to remain anonymous whistleblowers, fearful of the consequences for their careers if they become known as troublemakers. She manages to get a few of those accused – “the sinister forces in the shadows” – to go on the record with their responses, but most ignored her requests for interview.</p> <p>Stories abound of nightmare situations arising in writers’ rooms, on sets and in private offices, around racism, sexism, homophobia, inequitable returns for efforts, and the systemic abuse of those without power. Ryan’s crusader-like passion sometimes leads to overkill, the litany of sins that she uncovers providing more examples than required to make her points when a more selective approach would have been more effective.</p> <p>But it does mean that many of those that the system has turned into victims do get an opportunity to have their voices heard, even if only as “Joyce” or “Hannah”, or any of the other names she attaches to those who wish to avoid reprisal.</p> <p>Ryan is especially illuminating in her examination of some of the disturbing developments at <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. In this context, she cites journalist Seth Simons’ astute but unfashionable notion that stand-up comedians have long occupied a space for an ugly culture, one “where it has been OK to be a horrible person” (a point that becomes especially pertinent in the light of the coverage of Russell Brand’s transgressions).</p> <p>In the final section of the book, acknowledging that there’s no magic fix for the problems she’s identified, Ryan proposes several ways in which it might be possible to repair “the damage created by allowing toxic people – and systems – to run amok”.</p> <p>She quotes <em>The Atlantic’s</em> Adam Serwer about the best way to go about it: “The hope for a more equitable, democratic and prosperous society does not lie with enlightened corporations but with organised workers.” And, in line with this, she points to the need for writers, actors and others to work together to establish grassroots alliances and respectful workplaces in which to do their creative work.</p> <p>She ends by explaining that she’s no revolutionary, that she doesn’t actually want to burn Hollywood down. What she really wants is a business equivalent of a “prescribed burn”, one that can help prevent a wildfire. “Fire can be rejuvenating,” she writes, creating a neat analogy courtesy of <em>National Geographic</em>. “It returns nutrients to the soil … and can help young trees and other plants start to grow.”</p> <p><em>Burn It Down</em> sometimes labours its points, but the urgency with which Ryan champions her cause is both affecting and effective.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>'}},\n",

The Academy Award winner was the subject of a civil suit in a Utah court regarding a so-called ski-and-run accident in 2016. The actress was accused of running into a fellow skier while holidaying with her family. She said au contraire – he ran into her.\\n The court found in Paltrow’s favour (#Gwynnocent) but no one really cared about the nuts and bolts of the case. Instead, the world binged it like a Netflix drama, tuning in to check out Paltrow’s daily court looks (she’s wearing a turtleneck!) and quoting her most iconic one-liners, including the new meme: “Well, I lost half a day of skiing.”\\n It’s the latest in a long line of celebrity court battles to have captured the public fascination, stretching back to 1995 and OJ Simpson’s “trial of the century”. Last year delivered Johnny Depp v Amber Heard, which spawned a parallel trial on TikTok in which social media users declared Depp the innocent party and Heard guilty of, well, everything. A timely reminder, perhaps, that treating the courtroom as soap opera can have troubling real-world consequences. One worth remembering, given the next celebrity to take the stand will be one Donald Trump – a man who knows the power of performance better than anyone.

Drinkers buy a cup, which come in a range of sizes, from a participating cafe (8oz cup in charcoal or natural, $20) when ordering their caffeine fix, then return it when placing their next order (no need to even wash it). The “deposited” cups are sanitised and put back in rotation, with customers leaving with their fave brew in a “new” one. In due course, all cups, lids and saucers can be returned to Huskee or its swap partners – an app shows their locations – for end-of-life recycling.

It’s Indian but also French, said to have been created by the French colonists of Pondicherry (now Puducherry) on India’s south-eastern coast, and it will take your salmon kedgeree to the next level. Beat it into butter to pan-fry fish and melt over carrots, or just sprinkle over your weekend eggs for an instant wow factor. Jill Dupleix\\n READ / Role reversal Ever wondered why good-looking, talented women often date average-looking but interesting guys, while the reverse rarely happens? In Romantic Comedy by American novelist Curtis Sittenfeld, Sally is a divorced 30-something writer for a hit TV comedy show. Fed up with seeing gorgeous female celebrities hook up with the show’s dorky male writers, she writes a sketch about it. Enter Noah, a handsome rock star and guest on the show. The sexual tension escalates as they banter their way through lockdown via email. Among the book’s pithy one-liners: “Hot eventually gets boring but funny never does.” Sittenfeld has form in analysing relationships: she’s the author of bestselling 2020 novel Rodham, which reimagined the life Hillary Rodham would have had if she’d not married Bill Clinton. Nicole Abadee\\n WEAR / Step right up How many pairs of shoes does a man need? Four, according to the founders of shoe company Etymology – Gabriel Abi-Saab and brothers William and Albert Phung. A loafer or two, an Oxford and something not black. The Sydney-based trio founded the company during the pandemic and this month released their four-pair debut collection, which leans heavily into the loafer. The all-leather shoes are handcrafted in family-run workshops in the Spanish shoe-making capital of Almansa, and retail here online for $425 a pair. The inspiration? Abi-Saab’s Lebanese-Australian heritage: “My dad always wore this pair of loafers he found in Lebanon, even when going to the greengrocers. He took pride in the way he dressed.” Taking following in dad’s footsteps to a whole new level. Melissa Singer\\n WATCH / Dead Ringers It’s always a concern when a TV series or film casts an actor to star opposite themselves; the double-up can be great but can also be a gimmick used to paper over a thin plot. It worked a treat for Eddie Murphy in Coming To America but not in The Nutty Professor, while John Malkovich proved there is no such thing as too much Malkovich in Being John Malkovich. Thankfully, British actress Rachel Weisz is so charming in Dead Ringers (Amazon Prime) that you never get sick of seeing her star alongside herself. In this modern take on David Cronenberg’s 1988 thriller, Weisz plays twin gynaecologists whose desperation to change how women give birth pushes them into ethically questionable territory.

And the Vanity Fair contributing editor has written Burn It Down to tell readers why. “What should be assessed is not just the creative product, its financial cost, and its efficiency (or lack thereof),” she writes, “It’s also how productive and nurturing an environment it is.” Something that she goes to great lengths to explain isn’t happening now and never has been.\\n Her book, which deals mainly but not exclusively with the world of television, was written before the recent strikes by the American Writers and Screen Actors Guilds and doesn’t deal directly with the specific issues that have provoked them. But it does point to a range of resentments that have been simmering away for years, to do with how workplaces that ought to service the needs of employees have frequently become hellholes.\\n To most readers, much of this won’t come as a surprise.

And the<em> Vanity Fair</em> contributing editor has written <em>Burn It Down</em> to tell readers why. “What should be assessed is not just the creative product, its financial cost, and its efficiency (or lack thereof),” she writes, “It’s also how productive and nurturing an environment it is.” Something that she goes to great lengths to explain isn’t happening now and never has been.</p> <p>Her book, which deals mainly but not exclusively with the world of television, was written before the recent strikes by the American Writers and Screen Actors Guilds and doesn’t deal directly with the specific issues that have provoked them. But it does point to a range of resentments that have been simmering away for years, to do with how workplaces that ought to service the needs of employees have frequently become hellholes.</p> <p>To most readers, much of this won’t come as a surprise. Hollywood has long been infamous for what was once seen as routine behaviour but is now regarded as disreputable. The public testimonies of the courageous survivors of sexual assaults by men in powerful positions have exposed some of the darker activities hidden behind the surface gloss of the American film business.</p> <p>Ryan mentions in passing that she herself suffered this fate at the hands of an unnamed TV executive.

And while you might not be familiar with his name, it’s likely that you’ve seen, and perhaps even loved and admired, some of his work. It’s most recently on display in Shrinking and Ted Lasso (both Apple TV+), but stretches back to Spin City (Stan*) and Scrubs (Disney+).\\n Dubbed “Television’s Anonymous Mogul” in a Los Angeles Times profile, Lawrence has been working steadily for decades. Although in his early days he was sacked from the writing team on Friends – “I was a kid. I misbehaved a bit,” he subsequently explained – he soon rebounded. Teaming up with Gary David Goldberg (Family Ties), he created Spin City (1996-2002), the first of his beautifully balanced ensemble comedies.\\n In a long career, he’s had some misfires (remember Whiskey Cavalier, Undateable, Surviving Jack or Life Sentence? No? Not surprising). But the good ones are memorable and display a capacity to create vibrant communities in an array of settings: the New York mayor’s office in Spin City; a Sacramento hospital in Scrubs (2001-10); a fictional Florida district in Cougar Town (2009-15); an English soccer club in Ted Lasso; a Pasadena psychology practice in Shrinking.\\n Sometimes, his series feature workplace families with artfully jumbled bags of diverse personalities; sometimes they’re biologically connected families, along with their friends, neighbours and work colleagues. In classic sitcom style, each character contributes a distinctive note to the whole: a dumb one, a daffy one, a pompous one, a smart and sassy one, a neurotic, etc.\\n Wherever they live and whatever they do, in the best of Lawrence’s work these ensembles present vibrant, idiosyncratic and very funny characters in productions distinguished by clever casting and pitch-perfect tones. As neatly illustrated by Shrinking and Ted Lasso, they can bounce confidently from laugh-out-loud physical gags and goofy humour to more tender moments where the multi-dimensional characters reveal their vulnerabilities.\\n Lawrence isn’t a one-man band: often his comedies are created and produced with others. Ted Lasso was developed with Jason Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt and Joe Kelly, and there’s a phalanx of producers, including Brett Goldstein, who plays Roy Kent. But there’s a discernible thread running through Lawrence’s productions, no matter who he’s working with, and that’s the strength of the communities that he constructs.\\n One indicator of how well they’re structured is how many of the supporting characters become scene-stealers, even when the shows are ostensibly built around a prominent lead, such as Michael J. Fox in Spin City, Sudeikis in Ted Lasso or Jason Segel in Shrinking. That’s because the writing is so strong and the casting is spot on. The focus of Spin City might be Fox’s deputy mayor, but as well as giving us the wonderful Connie Britton in a feisty early role, there’s the joy of Richard Kind’s sweet, bumbling, perpetually flustered press secretary. Scrubs follows the misadventures of Zach Braff as the caring, adorably discombobulated Dr John “J.D.” Dorian. But Sarah Chalke’s contribution as the delightfully ditzy Dr Elliot Reid would be right at home in a classic 1930s Hollywood screwball comedy (which is high praise).\\n My litmus test of a great ensemble is that it’s hard to pick a favourite character. In Ted Lasso, for example, there’s robust competition for that distinction: is it the magnificently monosyllabic Roy Kent? Indomitable, effervescent Keeley (Juno Temple)? Sweet Nigerian winger Sam Obisanya (Toheeb Jimoh)? Perhaps Dani Rojas (Christo Fernandez) with his sunny smile and gleeful pronouncement that “Football is life!” Titular Ted might be the main man, but, while taking nothing away from the nominal protagonist, the wealth of talent around him makes the series stronger.\\n That’s also true of Shrinking, where co-creator and co-producer Segel plays Jimmy, a psychologist and widower grieving the recent death of his wife (Lilan Bowden) and destructively spiralling. As it begins, he’s seeking comfort in drugs and casual sex, and failing to be the parent that his wounded teenage daughter, Alice (Lukita Maxwell), desperately needs.\\n Jimmy works in a practice with a trio of therapists and each of them is as much in need of supportive counselling as their patients. Gaby (Jessica Williams) is dealing with divorce and blithely maintaining she’s fine, when clearly she isn’t. Paul (Harrison Ford) is trying to manage a health issue and is troubled by a strained relationship with his adult daughter (Lily Rabe).\\n Beyond the core characters is a skilfully fleshed-out community, among them Jimmy’s nosy neighbour, Liz (Christa Miller, Lawrence’s wife, who also appeared in Scrubs and Cougar Town), his best friend, hilariously fast-talking gay lawyer Brian (Michael Urie), and his patient, war veteran Sean (Luke Tennie), who’s suffering from PTSD and dealing with anger-management issues. Notably, too, Ford is in his element as the grumpy elder of the practice, a terse type who protectively guards his personal space only to find it continually invaded by his colleagues.\\n As with Ted Lasso – whose fourth season has been the subject of fervid speculation – Shrinking was originally pitched with a three-season structure, with the first to focus on grief, the second on forgiveness and the final one on moving forward.\\n The first season has set the bar high, with a line introduced in the first episode and repeated in the final one to significantly different effect neatly illustrating the quality of the writing. Initially, Jimmy looks lovingly at Alice and tells her how much she reminds him of her mother, an observation that’s filled with pain. In the final episode, when the line is repeated, there’s only love and pride. Without labouring the point, the series illustrates how far the pair has come.\\n It’s classic Lawrence.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nPet\\nCatherine Chidgey, Europa, $32.99\\n Writing the young is hard, and worst when they are in an abusive situation. Catherine Chidgey’s novel tells of innocence becoming experience, gradually, and her form is the psychothriller. Justine is 12, and has a crush on her charismatic teacher, Mrs Price. What anchors the book is the precise details of a New Zealand childhood from late last century, the games, lessons and lolly cigarettes. Sinister is a constant undertone, from petty thefts and casual racism to the school’s Catholic doctrines. Mrs Price has more than her class in thrall, for Justine’s widowed father has also fallen in love with her. The tension rises, page by page, with abortion clinic picketing and finally murder. Chidgey maintains momentum, her narrative hooking the reader’s attention. It should make one hell of a movie.\\n Strangers at the Port\\nLauren Aimee Curtis, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, $29.99\\n Sydney-born Lauren Aimee Curtis has already been named as a Best Young British novelist in Granta this year, so this second novel comes with expectations. It consists of three parts: the narrations of Giulia and Giovanna, two peasant sisters born on an island off Sicily, and that of a tourist, an Austrian Archduke. In the late 19th century the island follows immemorial rhythms, but change arrives. First come convicts, then the devastating phylloxera virus. It will force emigration, ending in Australia as an academic seeks the elderly Giovanna’s first-hand testimony. The parallels between modern eco-disaster and dislocation are clear, if not belaboured. The difficulty is that the pacing is languid, the lissom prose somehow lacking the urgency of what it describes. And quick Googling establishes that Archduke Ludwig Salvador, a “loose” model for Curtis, was rather more interesting than his fictionalisation, being a travel writer and early ecologist.\\n The Invisible Hour\\nAlice Hoffman, Scribner, $32.99\\n American writer Alice Hoffman has a long and successful career of bending genres. This novel uses the trope of travel into the past, not as young adult fare, but as high literary fandom. Teenage Mia has been reared in a patriarchal cult, where what is verboten for women includes libraries. Of course she disobeys, and discovers Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter. She sees the parallels with her life; it radicalises her. That is one half of The Invisible Hour, the other being struggling writer Hawthorne himself. That Mia should enter the past, his present, is dandy; less is their affair, which pushes the book into historical romance territory. Hawthorne was a Victorian male, who memorably complained of “damned scribbling women”, authors of trash that prevented his literary success. Despite the evocative writing, the two halves of the book work against each other.\\n The List\\nYomi Adegoke, Fourth Estate, $32.99\\n It’s rare that a modern novel is bang up-to-date. The List comes with maximum hype and a television series in production. Its angle? How cancel culture affects a relationship. Michael and Ola are a young power couple in London, scaling the internet to success. What is different is that both are African. The novel begins with them engaged, out on the town drunk and happy. Next comes crisis, when Michael is named on an e-list of abusive males. At stake is their planned wedding, an extravaganza costing thousands of pounds, and also their love. The book adroitly details consumer and pop culture, gender and racial identity. Nothing is simple, least of all self-examination and remaking a life. Yet despite the book’s craft, the vitality of Bernardine Evaristo or Nnedi Okorafor seems missing: it becomes a bit of a slog.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nBetter Than Happiness\\nGregory P. Smith, Penguin, $35\\n After 10 years living alone in a rainforest in northern NSW, Gregory Smith was sitting on a park bench longing for a friend when he experienced a “full-blown vision”. Suddenly, he was in the middle of a smouldering battlefield surrounded by the ruins of his life. Sword in hand he stood ready for attack – only to realise that he was the enemy. He had been fighting himself for too long. In that moment of grace, he swore off the alcohol, drugs and cigarettes he’d used to dull the pain of his traumatic childhood. It was the beginning of a remarkable journey of transformation and acceptance that lead him from homelessness to a fulfilling job as an academic, from emotional isolation to unconditional love. The epiphanies that allowed him to turn his life around make this wise and self-searching memoir an invaluable handbook for those looking for a path out of their own dark forest.\\n Close to the Subject\\nDaniel Browning, Magabala Books, $34.99\\n “I am a storyteller – nothing more,” says Daniel Browning. He might well have said “nothing less”, as the pieces in this collection from his three decades of work as a Bundjalung and Kullilli journalist, radio broadcaster and writer reveal storytelling to be the most expansive, all-embracing of forms. This understanding of storytelling coheres around the presence of the storyteller as interpreter, medium, editor, critic, commentator and showcaser of Indigenous voices, whether he is talking to Doris Pilkington, author of Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, teasing out the tale behind the plaster cast found in Lyon of an Aboriginal man from Fraser Island, reflecting on Warwick Thornton’s documentary about the uses and abuses of the Southern Cross or offering his own forceful critique of nationhood. “Australia is a shadow ... It plays out like an in-joke; no one is quite sure when to laugh.”\\n A Clear Flowing Yarra\\nHarry Saddler, Affirm Press, $29.99\\n So accustomed have Melburnians become to disparaging the Yarra that a joyful book about this waterway would have seemed, not long ago, to be a contradiction in terms. Then came the COVID lockdowns and we started to see the river and its tributaries in a different light. Harry Saddler takes this new appreciation to even greater heights in a book that exudes an infectious and giddy delight for its subject. There are encounters with platypuses from the riverbank in a suburban park. There are evenings spent listening to and eyeballing powerful owls. There are sightings of Salvatore, the adventurous seal. As he immerses himself in the river and its environs, he also gets to know the human creatures – from the Yarra River keeper to the community groups – who share his love of it, swim in it and care for it. If you thought you knew the Yarra, Saddler will make you think again.\\n Love, Dad\\nLaurie Steed, Fremantle Press, $32.99\\n Of the trials that heroes undergo in classical mythology, becoming a dad tends not to be one of them – which says a lot about traditional notions of masculinity. Laurie Steed believed he’d fashioned a workable “warrior-self” along the lines of the “tough, silent kind of manliness [that] was sold to us as boys”. Until fatherhood exposed his fault lines. As he stares into the eyes of his newborn son, he is struck by the fact that although he’s now a dad, he has not yet worked out how to be a man. Love, Dad is an open letter of gratitude to his sons for initiating him into a richer, more emotionally attuned version of manhood that fits his particular circumstances and deepens his relationship with his own father. This more nuanced self is not afraid to acknowledge his struggles, shortcomings and anxieties as a dad and a writer, while lovingly celebrating the wild ride of parenthood.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

If you thought you knew the Yarra, Saddler will make you think again.</p> <p><em><strong>Love, Dad</strong></em><br/><strong>Laurie Steed, Fremantle Press, $32.99</strong></p> <p>Of the trials that heroes undergo in classical mythology, becoming a dad tends not to be one of them – which says a lot about traditional notions of masculinity. Laurie Steed believed he’d fashioned a workable “warrior-self” along the lines of the “tough, silent kind of manliness [that] was sold to us as boys”. Until fatherhood exposed his fault lines. As he stares into the eyes of his newborn son, he is struck by the fact that although he’s now a dad, he has not yet worked out how to be a man. <em>Love, Dad</em> is an open letter of gratitude to his sons for initiating him into a richer, more emotionally attuned version of manhood that fits his particular circumstances and deepens his relationship with his own father. This more nuanced self is not afraid to acknowledge his struggles, shortcomings and anxieties as a dad and a writer, while lovingly celebrating the wild ride of parenthood.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>'}},\n",

The business climate is, however, going to be more difficult, with spending more subdued.”\\n Macquarie Group’s Shemara Wikramanayake said Australia’s immigration profile and strength in key industries should keep the country out of recession in 2024; however, slower economic growth should bring inflation back to the Reserve Bank’s targeted range by the end of the year.\\n “Broad-based inflationary pressures, driven by relatively strong economic demand and a tight labour market, will likely abate in the face of this slower growth,” Ms Wikramanayake said.\\n Commonwealth Bank boss Matt Comyn said there was only low risk of a recession next year, although that would increase should high inflation persist and the RBA needed to increase official interest rates further.\\n “Given the sharp rise in interest rates over the past 18 months, we think we are at, or very close to, the top of the current rate cycle,” Mr Comyn said.\\n The comments were made as part of The Australian Financial Review’s annual Chanticleer survey of more than 50 top ASX CEOs. Nearly all said higher interest rates and inflation were likely to slow growth; however, they pointed to immigration and infrastructure spending as reasons why Australia would avoid a recession.\\n Wesfarmers CEO Rob Scott said the homegrown cost pressures, including staff costs and raw materials, were the “greatest challenge to inflation” in the coming year.\\n “We are seeing significant increases in supply chain costs, wages, power and other services,” said Mr Scott, whose company owns hardware retailer Bunnings Warehouse, discount retailer Kmart and a big industrials chemicals business.\\n “There are risks of further pressures in 2024 with additional regulation and compliance costs, and less flexibility in the workplace to adjust to dynamic changes in the market will ultimately increase costs if we are not careful.”\\n CEOs with consumer-facing businesses said cost-of-living pressures would keep customers rethinking their spending habits and choices. Even so, they kept referring to the economy as “resilient”.\\n “I think most people have been surprised at how resilient the economy has been this year in spite of global shocks and interest rate hikes, so we’re cautiously optimistic that resilience continues,” said Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson, who took over from Alan Joyce in September.\\n “What we’re seeing is that demand across Jetstar and Qantas remains above pre-COVID levels, despite cost-of-living pressures.”\\n Coles CEO Leah Weckert, also new to her role, agreed customers were feeling the fiscal pinch: “Overall, we are optimistic about the resilience of the Australian economy and, in particular, non-discretionary sectors like supermarkets,” she said.\\n Woolworths’ Brad Banducci was reluctant to make any economic predictions, but said the government’s revised approach to skilled migration had helped address labour shortages that should ease cost pressures in the economy.\\n “It will allow Australia to better attract the talent we need to fill critical skills gaps and labour shortages across the economy, in turn supporting productivity growth,” Mr Banducci said.\\n “The ‘Skills In Demand’ visa is a big step forward and will help bring experts with emerging skills and expertise into Australia to help train and develop local team members.”\\n Elliott Rusanow, who runs Westfield owner Scentre Group and is a major landlord to the likes of Coles and Woolworths, said consumers were still spending up big at the shops.\\n “When you look at the consumer, aggregate consumer spending is also high,” Mr Rusanow said. “We’re seeing this play out in our business partner sales which are at record levels.”\\n Seven Group’s Ryan Stokes was one of only a few outliers who said there was a “high risk” of a hard economic landing and there was little room for further interest rate tightening.\\n “The resilience shown to date can only withstand so many shocks inflicted by the RBA,” Mr Stokes said.\\n “The RBA’s approach to the cash rate will eventually trigger the economic contraction they are targeting ... In short, rates have already moved too far too quickly. Patience needs to be demonstrated. Further rate increases are not required in the near term.”\\n Newmont CEO Tom Palmer, an Australian whose company bought Australia’s biggest listed goldminer Newcrest Mining this year, said it was too early to declare victory in the fight against inflation.\\n “Until there is a sustained and honest effort to increase productivity in Australia through genuine reform, the RBA has little option but to use the blunt instrument of cash rate increases to try and reduce inflation,” Mr Palmer said.\\n With Ciara Seccombe and Edmund Tadros\\n'}},\n",

Melissa Lucashenko’s electrifying new novel draws on recent research suggesting that “There were more dead on the Queensland frontier than Aussies killed in World War One”, making notions of Australia’s’ “peaceful” history now seem almost wilfully blind.\\n Lucashenko’s title is a portmanteau of Edinburgh and Glasgow, and was the name given to the penal colony that became Brisbane. Edenglassie opens in 2024, whenan ageing Aboriginal woman, Eddie, takes a fall and lands herself in hospital. Sceptical of the medical profession, given the history of her mistreatment by authorities, Lucashenko tells us, “she had been concerned with dirt all her life, and with being dispossessed of the same, not to mention treated like dirt, which is to say, trampled over and disregarded as a general rule”.\\n While in hospital, she is attended-to by Doctor Johnny, who has recently learned via DNA testing of his Indigenous ancestry, but Eddie’s granddaughter, the plain-speaking Winona, is quick to scuttle any idea that he can identify as Indigenous, without a thorough cultural education. Winona is something of a firebrand for Indigenous rights; in one particularly amusing incident, Winona confiscates the didgeridoo of a busking white man and wields it as a weapon against him.\\n In a second narrative strand set in the mid-1800s, we learn about Mulanyin, who belongs “to the five Yugembeh rivers which fell like wide blue ribbons from the western range”. Travelling with his law-brother Murree, Mulanyin encounters Nita. Nita was “rescued” from slavery by the Petrie family, working as a maid, but ultimately taken on as the family’s ward (though she continues to provide their domestic labour.)\\n The love affair between Nita and Mulanyin, as well as the depiction of kinship, shows the intimate ties these characters have to the land, defining not only their culture but notions of selfhood. In one scene, Mulanyin attempts to fish a female mulloway, but is directed by his elders to return it to the sea. Mulanyin then has “the electric realisation that all his life he had been eating the decisions of his ancestors”.\\n Edenglassie shows etiquette and respect as central to the Indigenous way of life, belying prevailing colonial attitudes. Mulanyin observes that a young Yugambeh boy was “quite rude not to stop and yarn”.\\n In 2024, Eddie encounters a presence in her hospital room, masterfully named by Lucashenko as “the Voice”. The omniscient narrator in Edenglassie serves Lucashenko particularly well, hovering between characters, enacting with nuance a variety of Indigenous perspectives: the moderate Eddie, who is more ready to reconcile herself to a peaceful solution, and Winona, who is understandably angry on behalf of her people.\\n Eddie explains to Winona at one point that the Petries’ son Tom was actually initiated, and thus “part of the tribe”, explaining that “things could have been different alright. If the whitefellas had just asked.” Throughout Edenglassie, the hope offered by Lucashenko, who won the Miles Franklin award in 2019 for Too Much Lip, is that despite the various injustices meted out by white settlers, understanding across cultural boundaries remains nonetheless possible through communication and respect.\\n In the earlier time-stream, the oppression of Indigenous people is extreme: we learn about a curfew announced by the cracking of a “stockwhip”. In an unforgettable scene, Lucashenko enacts the execution of Dundalli, an Indigenous warrior and resistance fighter whose death was horribly botched. At one point we learn that “the Kurilpa and Magandjin had been rudely shoved back from their river, often at gunpoint”.\\n Even the well-meaning Dr Johnny unwittingly commits a number of faux pas. When he points out a plaque in Brisbane, acknowledging an Indigenous warrior named Mulrobin, Winona derides this as tokenistic given Indigenous people have had to fight for every minor gain, which for her and her family has been “exhausting”. Dr Johnny also doubts the presence of the Voice and considers it a manifestation of Eddie’s cognitive decline, but to Indigenous characters this ancestral presence is very real.\\n Given the historical research Lucashenko deploys here, it’s not surprising that Mulanyin’s story involves a shocking brutality, and the depiction of the events of Mulanyin’s life are only made more poignant by the story of his love for the land, particularly the “saltwater”, and his palpable connection to kin.\\n It is through the dual time streams that Lucashenko emphasises the importance of truth-telling to contemporary Indigenous Australians. Eddie needs the truth to be recounted and acknowledged so that these past injustices may be healed, and the lack of truth is hauntingly evoked by Lucashenko as a profound absence.\\n Lucashenko’s meticulously researched novel speaks to a deep-seated violence not just in the past, but in the way our colonial history continues to be represented.

Putting together the platform’s essential scripted shows required difficult choices, but the list is illustrious.\\n Abbott Elementary\\nThe great American sitcom is not dead, it’s just morphed into this delightfully witty mockumentary about the ever-burdened staff at a primary school in West Philadelphia. Creator and star Quinta Brunson delivers 22-minute episodes that sing with character humour and absurd machinations. Janella James, as the school’s questionable principal, is the best scene-stealer on television right now.\\n The Americans\\nWhat began as a sharp Cold War thriller, following a pair of Russian spies (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) living as a couple complete with children in Washington DC, became a masterful study of what we will and won’t reveal to those closest to us. Deception has rarely been so intensely intimate, culminating in a note-perfect finale after six seasons.\\n Andor\\nThe rough equation is Star Wars with less Jedi and more John le Carre, but that doesn’t do justice to Tony Gilroy’s brilliant prequel series about how the dedicated spy from 2016’s Rogue One movie (Diego Luna), found his calling as a revolutionary. Dispensing with nostalgia but staging gripping set-pieces, this is a galaxy far, far away reimagined for adults.\\n Arrested Development\\nIgnore the subsequent Netflix revival, the original three seasons of this wonderfully loopy comedy about a dysfunctional family’s downfall constitute one of the funniest shows of this century. Jason Bateman is the dutiful son trying to hold everything together, but he’s surrounded by self-sabotaging kin whose antics are perfectly shaped by dry digressions, meta-commentary, and brain-bending ramifications.\\n Atlanta\\nDonald Glover’s surrealist-tinged comedy about a struggling college graduate (Glover) who works as the manager of his rapper cousin (an immense Brian Tyree Henry) was one of the most ambitious shows television has witnessed, and mostly it succeeded. The implications of being Black in America spiralled into uncomfortable realities, otherworldly horror, and soulful self-recognition.\\n The Bear\\n”Yes, chef!” A blackly comic drama about a fine dining savant (Jeremy Allen White) returning to run his late brother’s Chicago sandwich joint, the two seasons to date of this series have been defined by corrosive tension, whiplash humour, and family dynamics that are painfully gripping. Watching creativity and renewal take hold for these characters is both a blessing and a curse.\\n Bob’s Burgers\\nIt took a season to get going but Loren Bouchard’s animated sitcom about the family behind a New Jersey burger joint has become one of television’s enduring pleasures. The Belcher clan are a wonderful mix of characters, driving a winning sense of humour that eschews pop-culture references for a depiction of the everyday that is charmingly plausible.\\n Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\nThe original slay queen, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Geller) is a Californian high school student chosen to battle the forces of evil. It’s the first of many inspired mash-ups in this deeply influential supernatural adventure, which shines as a tale of feminist empowerment, a goofy serial, and a homage to friendship powered by rat-a-tat dialogue.\\n Desperate Housewives\\nIs it a soap opera or a satire of a soap opera? Marc Cherry’s blockbuster comedy about the many intrigues surrounding a group of neighbouring married women was both and much more. Upending how network television depicted wives, life on Wisteria Lane was wild, insightful, and given to almighty twists.\\n Homeland\\nEpisodic television has rarely seen a performance as fierce and finely judged as the one Claire Danes delivers in this spy drama, playing an obsessive CIA agent with bipolar disorder. The early seasons, with Damian Lewis as a possible foe hiding in plain sight, are a sinewy two-hander, before Danes’ Carrie Mathison becomes the focus of a taut, globe-trotting study of betrayal and sacrifice.\\n How I Met Your Mother\\nIf you crave the reassuring familiarity of a multi-camera studio sitcom, the nine seasons of this Hollywood comedy about the loves and laughs of a group of (initially) twentysomethings will hit the spot. The punchlines are sharp but the casting is perfect: Jason Segel, Cobie Smulders, Alyson Hannigan, and a fearless Neil Patrick Harris shine.\\n Loki\\nThe one television spin-off of Marvel’s movie blockbusters that mattered follows the titular brother of Thor, Tom Hiddleston’s capricious, arrogant Loki, who finds himself caught up with the agency regulating time itself and its representative, Owen Wilson’s laconic investigator. The unlikely duo’s double act is the show’s selling point, a give and take that is verbally dexterous and emotionally primed.\\n Lost\\nThe network drama that didn’t so much kick the door in for grandiose ambitions as knock the entire house down, the 121 episodes of this science-fiction laced epic gave us smoke monsters, temporal shifts, labyrinthine conspiracies and a handful of finely revealed characters. The mysterious island they were trapped on was a puzzle box of vast possibility, somehow kept in motion through six seasons.\\n Mrs America\\nCate Blanchett, Rose Byrne, and Uzo Aduba headline an exemplary cast in this historical drama about the 1970s battle in America between second-wave feminists and the conservative women who opposed them. This is a vivid, telling recreation, with depictions of real-life figures that are anything but textbook – these public and private conflicts are both nuanced and prescient.\\n The Muppet Show\\nAs the oldest show on this list – it ran between 1976 and 1981 – there are certainly dips in Jim Henson’s ground-breaking reinvention of the variety show, but Kermit, Miss Piggy, and their iconic fellow hand puppets thoroughly transcend the era. The best guests gave the backstage absurdity an artful, idiosyncratic charge, with guests like Elton John, Gilda Radner, and John Cleese.\\n NYPD Blue\\nControversial when it debuted in 1993, Steven Bochco and David Milch’s police procedural about a fictional Manhattan precinct raised the bar for the cop drama with intertwining storylines, pungent dialogue, and reflections on trauma. David Caruso ducked out after one season, but the pairing of Jimmy Smits and Dennis Franz gave the show a memorable core that carried it to classic status.\\n One Mississippi\\nDebuting in 2015 and unfairly cancelled after just two seasons, comedian Tig Notaro’s semi-autobiographical series has her playing a breast cancer patient who returns to her hometown to care for her dying mother. The observational comedy that ensures is deeply personal, heartbreaking in its misunderstandings, and willing to suspend reality to grasp deeper truths. This hidden gem is ripe for rediscovery.\\n Only Murders in the Building\\nSteve Martin, Selena Gomez, and Martin Short are aces together in this farcical crime caper about a trio of true crime podcast addicts who start recording when a neighbour in their NYC apartment block is murdered. It’s a rapid-fire satire and deadpan comedy of manners, but its secret weapon is a melancholic undertow that makes the motives tragic and the investigators dedicated to their unlikely friendship.\\n The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\\nThe murder trial that transfixed America 30 years ago is re-examined in a limited series that reveals the distorting nature of fame, rampant ego, and sexist double standards. In an all-star cast none surpass Courtney B. Vance as defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran: a showman created by the very system he despises.\\n Pose\\nBoisterous with a bittersweet chaser, this drama recreates in stunning detail the ball subculture in 1980s New York, where Black and Latino drag queens competed for recognition in private tournaments while representing their unofficial families. It’s hectic and not always subtle, but the show does what its historic subjects did: it claims space for the marginalised and lets their stories resonate.\\n Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.

Each night, Cosgriff solicits her audience to find out their top 10 likes – all of which she notes down in a self-professed “book of tiny delights”.\\n Interspersed with this gentle form of audience participation are humorous anecdotes and highly infectious, clever, original songs that Cosgriff belts out about her own likes while her hands move across her keyboard at a dizzying pace. Cosgriff’s a whip-smart, quick-witted, confident performer.\\n It becomes clear towards the end that what undergirds the show is a simultaneous sense of sorrow and joy – it’s a credit to Cosgriff that she can hold space for both, leaving audiences with an incredibly affirming (and funny) show that marvels in the tiny profundities that make up our lives.\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n COMEDY\\nPatrick Golamco | Pork Adobo\\nTrades Hall, until April 23\\n Patrick Golamco is surely a lock for a Best Newcomer nomination this festival.\\n Having come runner-up in the 2021 RAW Comedy National Grand Final, and storming Comedy Zone in 2022, his debut Melbourne solo show is loosely tied together by a story of visiting his 99-year-old grandmother in Manila to let her know he loves her while she may be on her deathbed.\\n Through song, breakneck-speed jokes and tales of therapy gone awry, he harnesses the neurotic, introverted nature of Luke McGregor, the shake-your-head puns of Tim Vine and the pull-the-rug-from-your-feet energy of Mitch Hedberg all at once.\\n There are sharp jabs at Catholics, his Chinese upbringing, and of course, tales of the titular recipe – all which are delivered with the aplomb of a festival veteran.\\n At only 40 minutes in length it’s on the leaner side of shows this year. But for those who prefer quality over quantity, you simply can’t miss it.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nComedy Zone\\nTrades Hall, until April 23\\n A five-dish taster, the hand-picked lineup of Comedy Zone decided by festival staff is a glimpse of the future stars of Australian comedy.\\n Hosted by AJ Lamarque, he turned the camp up to a degree that would make Joel Creasey blush with stories of coming out and being mixed-race. Ben Hunter shared his love of playing goal defence in netball and hesitation to hang out his clothes; Samuel Gebreselassie delivered deeply dark material of why Ethiopia is now famous for aviation disasters rather than famine; and Annie Boyle’s delivery was so dry that it left the audience parched. That said, a brilliantly employed dance move quenched the thirst in mere moments.\\n Alexandra Hudson delivered the strongest set of the evening honing in on her disabilities. However, 80% of her material was verbatim from her televised RAW Comedy-winning performance last year. If you’re yet to see it – don’t until after the show.\\n A well-rounded evening, but not as strong as previous years.\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nDaniel Kitson | I Shall Have a Good Think When Everybody’s Gone Home\\nMalthouse Theatre, until April 23\\n If you know, you know.\\n In 2002, Daniel Kitson took home the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 2007, he won the top gong at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. If the rules allowed you to win more than once, he’d have another half-dozen on his mantelpiece.\\n Make no mistake – Kitson is the greatest comedian of his generation. Even if his aversion to press, media and podcasts means the majority have never heard of him. When other comedians see him perform, often they consider quitting the art form, knowing that they’ll never reach the same heights. It’s known as a term within the cognoscenti as “the Kitson effect”.\\n Does this all sound sycophantic? Probably. But is it hyperbole? Absolutely not.\\n A poll conducted by Dave, a TV channel that is a subsidiary of BBC, saw British comics including the ilk of Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee, Tim Vine, Mark Watson, Jason Byrne and Greg Davies all agreeing that he reigned supreme.\\n The sold-out audience for the stuttering Brit’s latest 90-minute show at 12pm on a Sunday is filled to the brim with other award-winning comics from the festival watching on.\\n The show is a masterclass of delivery, quips and callbacks. Be it comparing his own work to a pavlova, keeping an audience member as a time-keeper or heartbreakingly cutting observations on the human condition – he’s armed with a vocabulary and wit that could rival Shakespeare.\\n All are delivered with rapid-fire articulation and multi-layered gags – and the interspersed crowd-work and reactionary exchanges are phenomenal.\\n Melbourne has long been his testing ground. If this is what he’s calling (read: deliberately underselling) as a work in progress, it’s near impossible to think how good the final product will be.\\n This is stand-up at its very finest. All for a measly $20.\\n Book yesterday, thrice.\\n Then you’ll know.\\n★★★★½\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n CABARET\\nAlice Tovey | Not Like the Other Ghouls\\nMalthouse – The Tower, until April 9\\n Channelling the wounded rage of Carrie, doused in pig blood, and the extreme camp of Courteney Cox’s absurd fringe in Scream 3, Alice Tovey, in a Ghostface leather corset dress, is not having a good night.\\n Playing a version of herself that’s hosting a spooktacular dinner theatre show at Frankenstein’s Palace, she has to cope with headliners dying en route. Now a meta one-woman show, Tovey stitches her generously vulnerable cabaret into a musical ode to teenage years of self-doubt, when she sought refuge in the queer otherness of horror movies.\\n Tovey’s mum pulled her out of school to read Twilight finale Breaking Dawn, after all, and she was just as much into mopey vampire boyfriends \\xadas fight-back final girls. But just who is that demanding, discombobulated voice in her head that sounds a lot like a Aussie Hollywood A-lister? There’s a lot going on here, and it’s all ghoulishly good.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nScout Boxall | Turbo Lover\\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 23\\n Scout Boxall is what happens if you’re raised on a diet of educational media, including the nightly news, Oregon Trail, the history channel, and Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing: an adult with a true crime and conspiracy theory obsession – one not killed off by working for five years as a court reporter.\\n Who doesn’t love conspiracy theories and true crime? Not this audience, who are thrilled to banter about their favourites and hear about Boxall’s.\\n This night was heavy on audience interaction. Boxall managed to take even the most banal responses and weave magic.\\n Turbo Lover is broadly about romance and love which Boxall claims are a mystery to them, but their material about being a non-binary bisexual finds favour with the crowd that loves it all, from the relateable to the risqué.\\n Their take on this universal material provides weird and wonderful truisms you can’t imagine any other performer pulling off.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY & THEATRE\\nLou Wall | vs. The Internet\\nACMI, until April 9\\n At six foot four, dripping Y2K vibes and geometrically precise braids, Lou Wall could be the Eureka Tower of Melbourne comedy. If only our architecture was as weird, queer and extremely online.\\n Of course this country kid was denied the internet until their mid-teens. Who else could nail the sorry-not-sorry ambivalence we all feel towards digital life? Wall’s envy of a schoolmate was turbo-charged by social media, but this is theatre, not therapy, and that jealous energy fuels a 120bpm multimedia onslaught that refuses to settle into any one genre, tone or voice.\\n Example: an early bit about an innocent Insta post seamlessly shifts into a hilarious exchange with an online foot fetishist that again morphs into a Lizzo-esque musical number as wrong as the whole thing is real.\\n The show’s Shyamalan-level twist ending proves that for all its high-wire lunacy, Wall is as sure-footed as they come.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by John Bailey\\n COMEDY\\nLaura Davis | Well Don’t Just Stand There Dancing\\nCampari House, until April 23\\n “If you’ve seen me before, I’ve changed,” says Laura Davis standing before us in pale chinos, denim shirt, red kerchief, and wide-brimmed hat. It’s not just the outfit.\\n Since last performing in Melbourne, Davis has been altered, as many of us have, by a pandemic and the curveballs of this new world we live in. Things are less predictable, more disorienting. Alarming things happen.\\n With a hectic pace, Davis veers between topics as varied as Jurassic Park, collecting rocks, and dispatching spiders, dropping in and out of character while delivering laughs that seem only tangentially related. It’s anarchic and the audience is with her all the way.\\n As the show unfolds, unravels, tangles, untangles and turns back on itself, we are brought full circle and Davis’ skill at weaving a story you didn’t know you were being told is unveiled. It’s remarkable and gratifying in equal measure.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nClara Cupcakes | Yee Howdy Rides Again\\nMalthouse Theatre, Playbox, until April 9\\n With looks like American drag queen Trixie Mattel and zany humour like Lucille Ball, Clara Cupcakes’ Yee Howdy Rides Again is a knee-slapping good time.\\n Dressed in a red hat, pink plaid shirt, denim shorts, cow-print boots, dark leather holster with a banana, then topped off with a bolo tie fastened with a cupcake slide, this camp one-woman show is a theatre western riding high on its theme.\\n The production incorporates a cardboard cactus called “Clara Cactus Face”, animated projector fire, elaborate costumes and whiplash sound effects, transporting audiences on a thrilling adventure that uses patriarchal cowboy culture and “cowpitalism” as a metaphor for feminist ideals.\\n Cupcakes is a versatile performer, transitioning between clowning, burlesque, improvisation, song and mime, adapting to sound and prop mishaps without faltering. Reliance on audience participation is always a risk, but Cupcakes’ guided cues enable a comfortable interaction.\\n So, giddy up! You’re in for a wild ride.\\n★★★★½\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nJames Nokise\\nCampari House, until April 23\\n One performer, one microphone, and one hour of straight stand-up resulting in sore cheeks for the audience. This is a ripper of a show.\\n Nokise, eponymous fancy man, makes it look easy as he freewheels between tales about himself, his Samoan family and his home country of Aotearoa (New Zealand) as only a performer with this level of skill can do. These deeply personal stories demonstrate a remarkable ability to draw the political from the personal in a way that avoids proselytising and endears him to the audience.\\n In his home country, he is known not only as a brilliant stand-up but as the host of mental health podcast Eating Fried Chicken in the Shower. His material about this potentially difficult topic is empathetic, well-handled and, yes, funny. No small feat.\\n Nokise’s years of experience delivering award-winning performances are evident in his comfort on stage and disarmingly charming delivery. A delight.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY & CABARET\\nMel & Sam | High Pony\\nThe Toff at Curtin House, until April 12\\n A line of purple netball bibs strung against the back curtain sets the scene for a show-stopping introductory song-and-dance number about sports culture.\\n Award-winning performers and podcast hosts Samantha Andrew and Mel O’Brien deliver a high-energy, seamless cabaret show with non-stop laughs that’ll make your cheeks hurt. Dressed in ’90s girl band-inspired outfits with high ponytails, black midriff halter necks, flared black and neon pants and bright eye shadow, they deliver musical hit after hit that has the audience in fits of laughter.\\n Featuring tunes about Where’s Wally, babies being cancelled and lesbians not getting “the ick”, they hilariously mock queer stereotypes from their own perspectives and experiences. Swift and simple costume changes also ensure limited respite from the lols.\\n A fitting sequel to Shit-Wrecked! (2022 MICF), Andrew and O’Brien have great on-stage synchronicity, chemistry and banter.\\n A chart-topping parody pop duo in the making.\\n★★★★★\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nDiana Nguyen | Going All In\\nMelbourne Town Hall – The Flag Room, until April 23\\n Stereotypes harm us all, but the joyous Diana Nguyen is empowered – thanks to expensive breathing classes and an extensive range of dildos – to reclaim the “Asians can’t swim” slur.\\n She’s leapt headlong into roiling oceans to feign surfing proficiency to net not one, but two boyfriends (at separate times), all while being a prime candidate for Bondi Rescue who can’t float in a swimming pool. Often snort-laughing at her own (saucy) jokes, Nguyen is a hoot who can sweep even the most blush-prone audience into her silliness.\\n If the show’s a bit loose, it all hangs (10) together in the end, with a powerful undercurrent beneath the surface of this generous-hearted hilarity. A trigger warning that there will be intergenerational trauma content washes up in the final lap, as the threads of family and the indomitable spirit of her Vietnamese mum, who came to Melbourne as a refugee, leave you beaming.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nBrendan Wan | Yummy Yummy Cha Cha!\\nTIC Swanston (The Nicholas Building), until April 9\\n Brendan Wan isn’t interested in dissecting the Chinese-Australian migrant experience in his debut solo sketch comedy show – and fair enough. There are plenty of comedians who do just that.\\n His interests lie more in the realm of the absurd and surreal, manifesting in the 10-plus sketches that make up his high-energy, hour-long show.\\n A member of the Chinese crime syndicate Hutong Dragons delivers a presentation on how the group can make themselves more inclusive (a definite standout of the show that has the audience in stitches). A rendition of a perennial favourite karaoke song goes wrong. Appearances by Wan’s “stuntman” Rusty Lopez are another highlight – his spot-on impersonation of a certain Australian comedic trio is so startlingly accurate, it elicits uproarious laughter.\\n The punchlines of many of Wan’s sketches are in the set-up, but certain premises feel underdeveloped and go on for too long. However, as a debut comedy show it shows promise – Wan is a sketch comedian to watch.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n COMEDY\\nLuke Heggie | Grot\\nMorris House, until April 23\\n “This country’s built on theft,” quips Luke Heggie, positioning himself as an anti-left, anti-right, no-BS anthropological commentator who has a few things to get off his angry chest.\\n There is no knowing wink. No applause breaks. No sip of water.\\n Grot is line after line of lacerating truth about this ridiculous, ugly and (sure) lucky country we inhabit. Following last year’s magnum opus, Lowbreed, Heggie’s new set is another scathing critique on Australia’s class system, face-palm hypocrisy and the way we’ve veered into an era where the most flexible people in the country – those who do yoga etc – “are also the most useless”.\\n The crowd were in hysterics at what a mental health day really is (I won’t spoil it) and, apart from a spotty bit on Indonesia (which will be ironed out across the 42 performances he’s doing), this is a perfect hour of sharp, slaying-them-in-the-aisles, stand-up comedy.\\n Surely, an early contender for most outstanding show of the festival.\\n★★★★½\\nReviewed by Mikey Cahill\\n COMEDY\\nStephen Hall | Letters From My Heroes\\nACMI, until April 23\\n Never meet your heroes. Or in Stephen Hall’s case, never write to them.\\n Over 50 minutes, Hall reads the fictitious responses from celebrities that he has reached out to for advice: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jack Nicholson, Rodney Rude, Billy Connolly and a host of deceased names – Thomas Edison, Sean Connery.\\n It’s a flimsy concept at best. At its worst, it’s nothing more than an excuse for Hall to deliver an abundance of impressions.\\n Ironically, the strongest moment of the show highlights its weaknesses – when Hall screens a real impromptu vox pop with his father who abandoned his family during his childhood. It’s a bittersweet moment of sincerity that no impression could ever match.\\n While his ability to manipulate his voice is impressive, those hoping to witness the type of satirical whiplash that he’s previously delivered on arguably Australia’s best comedy of the past decade (Mad As Hell) will be left underwhelmed.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nAnne Edmonds | Why Is My Bag All Wet?\\nComedy Theatre, until April 23\\n All it took was an apocalypse for Helen Bidou’s real-life alter-ego to capture her Welsh boyfriend.\\n When lockdowns lifted, she held onto him the good old-fashioned way: by getting pregnant. Her words, not mine, in a riotous hour of “I’m a mum now, can you believe it?” that sees the award-winning comedian reach heights almost as delirious as her Get Krack!n counterpart, including a lesson in how best to slouch down a wall drunk.\\n She’ll whip you from doom-scrolling Facebook Marketplace through to sequestering a defective high-chair from a troll coven in Edinburgh, and on to a regrettable incident in a two-storey Coles Local in the NSW capital that has her pondering why they don’t just drain the harbour for more real estate?\\n If new motherhood isn’t the freshest show idea, then Edmond’s hurricane-force edge-of-hysteria humour sells it, delivering the kind of high you get from the good drugs in hospital.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nChloe Petts, Rob Auton, Huge Davies | New Order\\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 23\\n New Order brings three of the UK’s newest, most original and best unknown-to-Australia comedians to the festival.\\n Chloe Petts delivers the most straightforward set of the trio, opening the night describing the joys of being a masculine lesbian in self-deprecating fashion. Having good-naturedly made herself a target, she then turns her attention towards the English-Australian relationship, sports fans, and bantering with the frankly odd audience.\\n Rob Auton has a lackadaisical presence, dispensing observational material with a side-serving of the absurd. Add in a dash of poetry combining melancholy and humour, and you have a unique fusion that leaves the audience pleasurably baffled.\\n Huge Davies ends the night with deadpan delivery and a keyboard that he wields to deliver musical comedy and comedy about music, both of which have a delicious dark streak.\\n With 15-20 minutes per performer, the material is tight and the variety proves a strength.\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nSam Campbell | Every Single Emotion\\nMax Watt’s, until April 23\\n Sydney crackpot Sam Campbell is on a tear.\\n In the past five years he’s scaled the highest heights in comedy by winning the top gongs at Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2018 and last year’s Edinburgh Fringe.\\n Every Single Emotion is not so much a return to earth as a madcap hour of swerving, unnerving LOLs that needs lots of tightening up but is still undeniably Cambo (read: utterly brilliant, constantly wrong-footing and spectacular value for money).\\n Playing his biggest room yet, Campbell’s demonic voice modifier and extra shouty approach engage the crowd well.\\n A mid-show cameo from a fellow comic lands nicely as he bags out The Hundred with Andy Lee and professes a desire to be on another more successful panel show. Just imagine.\\n He’s on fire when he riffs on Jason Statham’s culinary skills and Christian O’Connell’s odd level of fame, while a Pet Barn bit needs to be neutered. Wait for his call-back to The Three Ls – it’s classic Campbell, where you think everything has gone pear-shaped but in fact it’s all cool bananas.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Mikey Cahill\\n COMEDY\\nKirsty Webeck | A Bit of Fun\\nThe Westin Three, until April 23\\n If you’ve accidentally been hoodwinked into going to the ballet by anyone pulling the “fun voice”, the last thing you’ll want to do is squish into a pair of tights, get up on stage and perform a pas de deux.\\n Kirsty (never Kristy, maaaybe Kransky) knows this, and that Swan Lake is too long. So if you love short and snappy comedy gigs with a great deal of heart but are terrified of audience participation, relax, you’re in safe hands.\\n An animal farm of content, from shocking rat attacks to the unfortunate fate of sperm whales, unfolds. Webeck’s obsessed with naming our furry friends and will take it personally if you don’t let her, even if it’s your second birthday (firsts are just dumb). There are busloads of LOLs to be had in a show that, unlike the ballet, isn’t flashy but will leave you wheeze-laughing a great deal more.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nDane Simpson\\nComedy Republic, until April 10\\n Dane Simpson named his show Always Was, Always Will Be…Funny on a whim, but it’s easy to imagine the funny kid he was when watching the cheeky, likeable performer he is now.\\n The show centres on Simpson’s recent life experiences and relationships, and his material remains personal even when it explores the more political aspects of life as a Gamilaraay man.\\n He sometimes uses short videos and pictures to help illustrate his material, but this is essentially a classic stand-up show with wordplay, callbacks and quippy one-liners in between longer stories.\\n He isn’t the only funny one in his family, and his delight in sharing their antics is contagious. Simpson appears to be having as much fun as the audience as he giggles at his own jokes, inviting the room to laugh along with him.\\n His personable delivery creates a natural rapport that results in steady laughter and applause.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nLucinda Price and Louis Hanson | Besties\\nTrades Hall – Solidarity Hall (show’s run is now complete)\\n Besties is an intimate slumber party filled with storytelling, confessions, witty banter and deliberately dorky singing and dancing.\\n Originally from Melbourne, comedians and creators Lucinda Price and Louis Hanson return home to a loving audience of social media fans, childhood friends and family. Dressed in Hello Kitty pyjamas, Price and Hanson get vulnerable, sharing parts of themselves yet to be disclosed – even on their respective Instagram and TikTok accounts. Price’s divulgence about a sexual encounter with an unnamed celebrity will leave audiences googling on the trip home.\\n From footage of embarrassing gigs to a fake image with an ex’s ex, their wizardry in video editing and Photoshop adds a meme aspect to the show, representative of their work at Pedestrian TV and as online personalities.\\n Witnessing Price and Hanson’s close-knit kinship feels like a warm hug, inviting the audience into a three-way call that you never want to end.\\n★★★★★\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nNina Oyama and Jude Perl | We Should Hang Out!\\nThe Westin Three, March 31 (show’s run is now complete)\\n Six comedians, one hour. What better way to spend three nights at the comedy festival? (n.b. this show’s run ended on April 1).\\n Nina Oyama, with her effortless charm and affable on-stage persona, and Jude Perl, with her virtuosic combination of dark humour, remarkable keyboard skills and a killer voice to match, are the hosts of a “loose and live” late-night variety show – featuring four comedic acts as divergent in their styles as their hosts are.\\n The jokes come a mile a minute in Suren Jayemanne’s confident set, spanning topics as varied as gentrification, rescue dogs and accents. Heath Franklin has the crowd on edge by deliberately wading into taboo territory, but subverts expectations in surprising ways. Aurelia St Clair’s languid, ASMR-pleasing delivery is responsible for perhaps one of the best mental health jokes of the festival thus far. And rounding it out is Frankie McNair as the sultry, chain-smoking Tabatha Booth, cleverly interweaving her off-kilter humour with burlesque.\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n COMEDY\\nRose Bishop | Feral\\nChinese Museum, until April 9\\n Rose Bishop is a feral.\\n What is a feral? In Bishop’s view, it’s a term to depict the lower-socioeconomic class that she grew up around in regional Western Australia. Ferals will get drunk enough to ruin Christmas (but not bash anyone); ferals will get vaccinated as long as it’s covered by Medicare.\\n Directed by festival mainstay Claire Hooper, Bishop’s debut solo hour is a patchwork of stories about her own feral-ness – be it tales of an amorous kangaroo that she took in as a pet, looking after a greyhound allergic to its own teeth, aiming to always have sex on the first date or inheriting trauma instead of property.\\n Oh, and a frankly absurd anecdote about spending time on a billionaire sheikh’s super-yacht with snarky Russian sex workers. We’ve all been there, right?\\n While there is an over-reliance on expletives for laughs, Bishop’s well-structured storytelling and confident delivery makes for an impressive debut.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY & CABARET\\nAli McGregor | Late-Nite Variety-Nite Night\\nThe Famous Spiegeltent at Arts Centre Melbourne, March 31 (on until April 9)\\n At an indeterminate point in time, Ali McGregor’s Late-Night Variety-Nite Night reached cult status.\\n For 16 years, the soprano has plucked a melange of comedy and cabaret acts from a massive trove for a 75-minute showcase. Each evening, there’s a different haul.\\n A tight band of keyboards, drums and bass welcomes McGregor into the hazy lights of The Famous Spiegeltent – an ideal venue for such a show.\\n Not quite seamlessly, the acts pour onto the tiny stage.\\n First-up is comedian-actor Diana Nguyen, followed by hyper-expressive acrobat-artist Jess Love and her jaw-dropping hula-hoop set.\\n Comic/songwriter Gillian Cosgriff enchants with a keyboard takeover, skipping through a joyous observational score that lets rip.\\n Stand-up Carl Donnelly entrances with a 12-minute shower gel discussion.\\n McGregor, interspersing the acts with soaring, melodic mash-ups, describes it as a “bargain of a show”. Spot on.\\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\\n COMEDY & THEATRE\\nOsher Gunsberg | Night Time News Network National News\\nMalthouse Theatre – Beckett Theatre, until April 9\\n Osher Gunsberg drops his sanitised reality TV host persona for an evening of participatory theatre that satirises live news.\\n Performing alongside a ragtag Sydney-based improv troupe, unique headlines are written prior to each show, acting as a live prompt similar to Whose Line Is It, Anyway?\\n Gunsberg is dressed as a Ron Burgundy-esque news anchor in a pink suit and orange-rimmed glasses. His prologue – projected loudly in signature fashion – contextualises the show, laying the groundwork for a future commercial television pitch.\\n Incorporating live crosses and crew interactions, there’s inconsistency across the performers in their ability to deliver convincing news segments. Alex Reynolds and Orya Golgowsky are standouts in their world building, characterisations, facial expressions and physical comedy – getting the largest laughs in any sketch.\\n Reminiscent of The Chaser, this is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy show that could be ripped (but for liability reasons is not) straight from the headlines.\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nOpening Night Comedy Allstars Supershow\\nPalais Theatre, March 29\\n\\n A 150-minute melange of taste-testers, the annual Allstars Supershow delivers the audience bite-sized teasers to satiate every form of the comedic palate. This year, to mixed results.\\n Hannah Gadsby took on compering duties, and warmed the crowd with reflections of her recent marriage to her former tour manager. Anne Edmonds opened proceedings with her regular polemic style – shooting daggers at D-grade celebrities who seek fame on reality TV and commercial radio. Dilruk Jayasinha followed by bringing up the cricket rivalry between Australia and his home country of Sri Lanka – and the uneasy fact that his mother fancied the late Shane Warne.\\n On the international front, the beat-boxing skills of the Icelandic Ari Eldjarn landed soundly; American Kyle Kinane took shots at himself when referencing the January 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol and the social faux pas that comes with buying a telescope; and New Zealander Guy Montgomery skewered the Bechdel test and explained the difficulty of implementing it into his everyday life. All to uproarious effect.\\n Similarly, Douglas Lim, Anirban Dasgupta, Leo Reich and The Lucas Bros all easily won over the crowd – albeit it with a vastly ranging difference of styles.\\n Best Newcomer at Edinburgh Festival Fringe Lara Ricote delivered the most risque gag of the evening – regarding cysts in her reproductive organs and an abortion. It slayed the room. If the ABC actually air it during their broadcast next week, I wouldn’t want to be working in their complaints department.\\n Among all the well-placed bullseyes, there were of course a few that failed to hit the board.\\n David O’Doherty’s ongoing cheap keyboard shtick elicited yawns; Bronwyn Kuss’ never-ending repetitions about Tina Arena well overstayed its welcome; and Huge Davies’ barbs and impressions about modern-day dance music read the room about as well as Tommy Wiseau.\\n Georgie Carroll’s anecdotes about rotator cuff tears went down like a balloon over the seas of South Carolina; and headline grabber Reuben Kaye doubled down upon his recent controversy with Catholics by employing juxtapositions about the church, priests and drag queens. Clever enough, but you could see the punchlines coming from St Kilda Road.\\n Concluding the evening, Dave Thornton scored the highest decibels of applause of the night with a sharp attack at King Charles and for a proposition of vasectomies versus IQ levels.\\n A few lulls aside, inevitable in such a gargantuan event, the merriment of this year’s Allstars Supershow lit the fuse to set off the celebratory firework of more than 600 shows across the city over the next month.\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nElyce Phillips | Pretends to Be On Tropical Holiday For 50 Minutes (Definitely Not A Scam)\\nThe Butterfly Club, until April 7\\n Elyce Phillips has only been staying at premium luxury resort Poseidon Sands for a day. Or has she?\\n Featuring an elaborate mix of gross-out hijinks, well-crafted props and costumes, and sophisticated multimedia (no doubt drawing on Phillips’ other hat as an illustrator), nothing is immune from censure in Phillips’ delightfully chaotic, multilayered show.\\n The show’s episodic structure has Phillips oscillating between a bikini-clad tourist, a sea cucumber and the unwilling assistant of a chauvinistic big wet ham – among other characters – while the sound and light design effortlessly shifts the tonal register between sequences.\\n Phillips is a master at pulling the rug out from under her audience – nothing is what it seems at the ramshackle Poseidon Sands, too far from the beach to be anything other than the ‘jewel of the inner coast’.\\n The Butterfly Club, with its tightly packed pews and haunted tiki bar vibe, is the perfect setting for its unravelling.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair \\n COMEDY\\nBec Petraitis | Merry\\nCampari House, until April 9\\n The carols are pumping, the decorations are hung and the stage is set for the tale of Bec Petraitis’ Christmas Day, 2021, her worst on record.\\n It’s true, the Christmas in question was not that bad – something Petraitis is quick to point out when she promises at the outset nobody died. However, amid the COVID years, our tolerance for disappointment was low, and Petraitis is quite the Christmas fan.\\n What follows is a series of unfortunate events told with the aid of dramatic inner monologues, neat stagecraft, and a knack for storytelling.\\n With her expressive face and charming style, Petraitis’ tally of dissatisfactions brings frequent laughs of both recognition and sympathy. There are understated punchlines dispensed with dry wit and the occasional diversion into silliness, which delight the audience.\\n Here’s a performer who keeps the laughs rolling, the snark light and the atmosphere warm – just like a good Christmas.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nCourtney Crisfield | Cult Classic\\nQueen Victoria Women’s Centre, until April 18\\n You know that friend who always speaks in film quotes?

Each night, Cosgriff solicits her audience to find out their top 10 likes – all of which she notes down in a self-professed “book of tiny delights”.</p> <p>Interspersed with this gentle form of audience participation are humorous anecdotes and highly infectious, clever, original songs that Cosgriff belts out about her own likes while her hands move across her keyboard at a dizzying pace. Cosgriff’s a whip-smart, quick-witted, confident performer.</p> <p>It becomes clear towards the end that what undergirds the show is a simultaneous sense of sorrow and joy – it’s a credit to Cosgriff that she can hold space for both, leaving audiences with an incredibly affirming (and funny) show that marvels in the tiny profundities that make up our lives.<br/><em>Reviewed by Sonia Nair</em></p> <p><strong>COMEDY</strong><br/><strong>Patrick Golamco | Pork Adobo</strong><br/><a href=\"https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2023/shows/pork-adobo\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trades Hall, until April 23</strong></a></p> <p>Patrick Golamco is surely a lock for a Best Newcomer nomination this festival.</p> <p>Having come runner-up in the 2021 RAW Comedy National Grand Final, and storming Comedy Zone in 2022, his debut Melbourne solo show is loosely tied together by a story of visiting his 99-year-old grandmother in Manila to let her know he loves her while she may be on her deathbed.</p> <p>Through song, breakneck-speed jokes and tales of therapy gone awry, he harnesses the neurotic, introverted nature of Luke McGregor, the shake-your-head puns of Tim Vine and the pull-the-rug-from-your-feet energy of Mitch Hedberg all at once.</p> <p>There are sharp jabs at Catholics, his Chinese upbringing, and of course, tales of the titular recipe – all which are delivered with the aplomb of a festival veteran.</p> <p>At only 40 minutes in length it’s on the leaner side of shows this year.

Ferals will get drunk enough to ruin Christmas (but not bash anyone); ferals will get vaccinated as long as it’s covered by Medicare.</p> <p>Directed by festival mainstay Claire Hooper, Bishop’s debut solo hour is a patchwork of stories about her own feral-ness – be it tales of an amorous kangaroo that she took in as a pet, looking after a greyhound allergic to its own teeth, aiming to always have sex on the first date or inheriting trauma instead of property.</p> <p>Oh, and a frankly absurd anecdote about spending time on a billionaire sheikh’s super-yacht with snarky Russian sex workers. We’ve all been there, right?</p> <p>While there is an over-reliance on expletives for laughs, Bishop’s well-structured storytelling and confident delivery makes for an impressive debut.<br/>★★★½<br/><em>Reviewed by Tyson Wray</em></p> <p><strong>COMEDY &amp; CABARET</strong><br/><strong>Ali McGregor | Late-Nite Variety-Nite Night</strong><br/><a href=\"https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2023/shows/ali-mcgregor\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Famous Spiegeltent at Arts Centre Melbourne, March 31 (on until April 9)</strong></a></p> <p>At an indeterminate point in time, Ali McGregor’s <em>Late-Night Variety-Nite Night</em> reached cult status.</p> <p>For 16 years, the soprano has plucked a melange of comedy and cabaret acts from a massive trove for a 75-minute showcase. Each evening, there’s a different haul.</p> <p>A tight band of keyboards, drums and bass welcomes McGregor into the hazy lights of The Famous Spiegeltent – an ideal venue for such a show.</p> <p>Not quite seamlessly, the acts pour onto the tiny stage.</p> <p>First-up is comedian-actor Diana Nguyen, followed by hyper-expressive acrobat-artist Jess Love and her jaw-dropping hula-hoop set.</p> <p>Comic/songwriter Gillian Cosgriff enchants with a keyboard takeover, skipping through a joyous observational score that lets rip.</p> <p>Stand-up Carl Donnelly entrances with a 12-minute shower gel discussion.</p> <p>McGregor, interspersing the acts with soaring, melodic mash-ups, describes it as a “bargain of a show”.

His prologue – projected loudly in signature fashion – contextualises the show, laying the groundwork for a future commercial television pitch.</p> <p>Incorporating live crosses and crew interactions, there’s inconsistency across the performers in their ability to deliver convincing news segments. Alex Reynolds and Orya Golgowsky are standouts in their world building, characterisations, facial expressions and physical comedy – getting the largest laughs in any sketch.</p> <p>Reminiscent of <em>The Chaser</em>, this is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy show that could be ripped (but for liability reasons is not) straight from the headlines.<br/><em>Reviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar</em></p> <p><strong><b>COMEDY</b><b><br/>Opening Night Comedy Allstars Supershow</b><b><br/>Palais Theatre, March 29</b><br/></strong></p> <p>A 150-minute melange of taste-testers, the annual Allstars Supershow delivers the audience bite-sized teasers to satiate every form of the comedic palate. This year, to mixed results.</p> <p>Hannah Gadsby took on compering duties, and warmed the crowd with reflections of her recent marriage to her former tour manager. Anne Edmonds opened proceedings with her regular polemic style – shooting daggers at D-grade celebrities who seek fame on reality TV and commercial radio. Dilruk Jayasinha followed by bringing up the cricket rivalry between Australia<i> </i>and his home country of Sri Lanka – and the uneasy fact that his mother fancied the late Shane Warne.</p> <p>On the international front, the beat-boxing skills of the Icelandic Ari Eldjarn landed soundly; American Kyle Kinane took shots at himself when referencing the January 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol and the social faux pas that comes with buying a telescope; and New Zealander Guy Montgomery skewered the Bechdel test and explained the difficulty of implementing it into his everyday life. All to uproarious effect.</p> <p>Similarly, Douglas Lim, Anirban Dasgupta, Leo Reich and The Lucas Bros all easily won over the crowd – albeit it with a vastly ranging difference of styles.</p> <p>Best Newcomer at Edinburgh Festival Fringe Lara Ricote delivered the most risque gag of the evening – regarding cysts in her reproductive organs and an abortion. It slayed the room. If the ABC actually air it during their broadcast next week, I wouldn’t want to be working in their complaints department.</p> <p>Among all the well-placed bullseyes, there were of course a few that failed to hit the board.</p> <p>David O’Doherty’s ongoing cheap keyboard shtick elicited yawns; Bronwyn Kuss’ never-ending repetitions about Tina Arena well overstayed its welcome; and Huge Davies’ barbs and impressions about modern-day dance music read the room about as well as Tommy Wiseau.</p> <p>Georgie Carroll’s anecdotes about rotator cuff tears went down like a balloon over the seas of South Carolina; and headline grabber Reuben Kaye doubled down upon his recent controversy with Catholics by employing juxtapositions about the church, priests and drag queens. Clever enough, but you could see the punchlines coming from St Kilda Road.</p> <p>Concluding the evening, Dave Thornton scored the highest decibels of applause of the night with a sharp attack at King Charles and for a proposition of vasectomies versus IQ levels.</p> <p>A few lulls aside, inevitable in such a gargantuan event, the merriment of this year’s Allstars Supershow lit the fuse to set off the celebratory firework of more than 600 shows across the city over the next month.<br/><i>Reviewed by Tyson Wray</i></p> <p><strong>COMEDY<br/>Elyce Phillips | Pretends to Be On Tropical Holiday For 50 Minutes (Definitely Not A Scam)</strong><br/><a href=\"https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2023/shows/elyce-phillips\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Butterfly Club, until April 7</strong></a></p> <p>Elyce Phillips has only been staying at premium luxury resort Poseidon Sands for a day.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\n Firelight\\nJohn Morrissey, Text, $32.99\\n\\nFirst Nations fiction and sci-fi might sound like strange bedfellows, although anyone who saw the Shadow Spirit exhibition at Melbourne’s Rising festival this year (which featured First Nations Star Wars characters alongside ancient stories and cultural knowledge) will know how fertile their conjunction can be. Kalkadoon author John Morrissey has produced a suite of short stories – some of them sci-fi, most within the realms of magical realist or speculative fiction – that investigate colonialism and identity with a keen eye and an uninhibited imagination. It’s a volume that features a little green man and the colonisation of the Moon, fraught attempts by scientists to reconstruct a thylacine, and a Gothic-tinged revenge fantasy in which an Aboriginal warrior haunts the white explorer responsible for his murder. An elegant and unpretentious narrative style allows Morrissey to reach for outlandish or bizarre elements with the irreducible impact of a lucid dream. It’s a fable-like, inventive, and well-crafted collection.\\n Serengotti\\nEugen Bacon, Transit Lounge, $32.99\\n Eugen Bacon’s Serengotti follows Ch’anzu, a gender-nonconforming narrator, on a day from hell. Ch’anzu loses hir job, and walks in (totally hungover) on hir wife Scarlet having pneumatic sex with a guy half her age. The opening chapters are set in contemporary Melbourne but there’s a hyperactive buzz of disorientation and dislocation in the prose, which has a futuristic feel and surges forward using the unusual second-person perspective. You’re put into Ch’anzu’s shoes as hir life crisis leads first to the wisdom of Aunt Mae, and on to a migrant African community, Serengotti, deep in the Australian bush. Eugen Bacon has a propulsive experimental style that voraciously incorporates idiom from urban, internet, Australian and African contexts to forge something new. Momentum builds quickly in this rush of a novel, which illuminates questions of gender and race as they are experienced, and has a sharper focus on how the world turns in urban Australia than most new fiction.\\n Prophet\\nHelen Macdonald & Sin Blache, Jonathan Cape, $34.99\\n Co-written during lockdown by Helen Macdonald (H is for Hawk) and Sin Blache, Prophet literally weaponises nostalgia. The title refers to a military-grade chemical that causes those exposed to it to fall into a nostalgic trance, creating figments of the past from treasured memories. Naturally, such a weapon could be disastrous in the wrong hands. And perhaps there are no right hands, as two agents – super-buff American action hero Adam, and dissolute but sharp-minded Rao, a former British intelligence operative – discover. Following Prophet’s destructive trail from Britain to the American West, it seems Prophet has new properties waiting to be unleashed. This sci-fi queer romance espionage thriller smashes together a bewildering array of genre fiction tropes, but it’s obsessively crafted, and has the kind of philosophical underpinning that makes it read more like postmodern fabulism than fanfic.\\n Temperance\\nCarol Lefevre, Wakefield, $34.95\\n It’s 1963 and widowed café owner Stella Madigan struggles to make ends meet after the death of her husband. The arrival of unconventional artist Mardi Rose promises a reprieve from working-class life for Stella and her young children, Fran and Theo, but when they embark upon a road trip to Byron Bay, they make it only as far as the tiny hamlet of Temperance in the Australian Outback. There, a horrifying and half-remembered incident turns the family back, and it will plague the children into their adult lives. Award-winning writer Carol Lefevre has a deft touch for psychological drama and the intricacies of domestic relationships. Here she takes a tightly stretched working-class canvas and loosens it into an evolving mystery (and a deferred coming-of-age tale) spanning decades. Lefevre is particularly good at showing the subtle effects of trauma, and the intensity of repressed emotion.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nBeeswax and Tall Tales\\nJane Crowley with Athol Salter, Ventura Press, $32.99\\n This polished collection of tales from the antiques trade could easily have been sub-titled “Life’s Little Ironies”, for the way it reflects human foibles in all their variety. Jane Crowley’s father, Athol Salter, has spent a lifetime buying and selling antiques and throughout that time continually shared the stories he gathered along the way with his daughter. Written from her father’s point of view, the stories are full of intriguing characters, from shifty types who get their comeuppance, a sad widower in Wagga whose last wish before suiciding is denied him by big-city lawyers, and a Welsh collector whose dying business is, to an extent, emblematic of the trade. And all of them revolving around selling artefacts, be it a bath, a chiffonier or an old farm table. Lovingly crafted and sure-footed, this could become a collector’s item.\\n Girls [Don’t] Play Sport\\nChloe Dalton, Allen & Unwin, $34.99\\n When Chloe Dalton was young watching her brothers play rugby she would practise kicking at half-time, often being told by adults that she should play the game. Her reply was, “Girls don’t play rugby”. In 2016 she won Olympic rugby gold in Rio. Her journey, her successes and her experience inform this combination of treatise and memoir. It also provides a snapshot of women in sport, citing, say, the struggle that swimming legend Fanny Durack had to get to the 1912 Olympics. In what is basically a call to arms she highlights the achievements, and prejudices that women’s sport still faces: pay, training facilities, misogyny, trolling and the reaction to the now iconic photo of Tayla Harris goaling from the 50-metre mark. Deeply passionate, her enthusiasm is infectious, and we can only hope one day nobody will think twice about girls playing footy – or any other sport, for that matter.\\n The Chipilly Six: Unsung Heroes of the Great War\\nLucas Jordan, NewSouth, $34.99\\n It takes a certain type of larrikin daredevil to do what six Australians soldiers did in the middle of the Battle of Amiens in August 1918. The allied offensive had been stopped by a line of German machine gunners on the spur above the Somme village of Chipilly. Repeated frontal assaults had failed. During the morning sergeants Jack Hayes and Harold Andrews went for a “stroll” into the village looking for souvenirs – as you do. That night they led a patrol of six, flanked the German gunners and took them out, capturing 71 prisoners and nine machine guns – achieving what an entire army couldn’t. It’s impossible to read this ripping, vivid recreation of events without shaking your head in disbelief. For years history paid scant attention to the “six”. This account (covering post-war years) and drawing on firsthand testimony corrects that.\\n The Shrinking Nation\\nGraeme Turner, UQP, $32.99\\n This is a sort of report card on Australian politics over the past 15 years, and it’s not good. The phrase “must try harder” comes to mind. Australia and the world have changed enormously in that time, but our national governments have gone missing in vital areas such as climate change, social welfare and closing the gap. The period, especially from Tony Abbott’s government on, was marked by what we might call policy paralysis, the ship of state was left to drift and the country has shrunk, so it’s “less than it was, less than it should be”. Graeme Turner’s clear, emphatic, convincing examination is a big-picture study of a time when the big picture deserted our politics. It’s also a searing indictment of decades of neo-liberalist hypocrisy. But there’s also hope, with Turner seeing positives in the busyness of the Albanese administration.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'This photograph captures a candid moment of two men, seemingly musicians David Byrne and Brian Eno, inside a Chemist Warehouse, a prominent Australian pharmacy chain. The image is rich in detail, showcasing not only the individuals but also the vibrant, bustling atmosphere of the store.\\n\\n**The Men:**\\n\\n* **David Byrne (left):**  Recognizable by his distinctive features and attire, Byrne stands slightly to the left of the frame. He is known as the former lead singer and guitarist of the influential new wave band Talking Heads. His musical career spans decades, marked by innovative work in various genres, including rock, funk, and world music.  He is also a visual artist, writer, and cyclist, known for his advocacy for urban cycling.  In the photograph, he wears a dark blazer over a dark, subtly patterned shirt and dark denim jeans. His expression is relaxed and approachable, almost as if he\\'s engaged in conversation.\\n\\n* **Brian Eno (right):**  Standing to the right, Eno, a renowned music producer, composer, and visual artist, complements Byrne\\'s presence.  Eno\\'s career is marked by pioneering work in ambient music and electronic music production. He has collaborated with numerous artists, including David Bowie, U2, and Coldplay, and is considered a highly influential figure in the music industry.  In the image, Eno wears a dark fedora, a dark blue plaid blazer, a black undershirt, and dark trousers.  He sports a full beard and a calm, almost contemplative expression.\\n\\n**The Setting: Chemist Warehouse**\\n\\nThe backdrop of the photograph is unmistakably a Chemist Warehouse. Several key visual elements confirm this:\\n\\n* **Bright Blue and Yellow Signage:** The dominant colors are the signature bright blue and yellow of the Chemist Warehouse branding. These colors are visible on the shelves, price tags, and promotional signs.\\n* **\"Cheaper @ Warehouse Prices\" Slogan:** This iconic slogan is clearly visible on yellow signs hanging from the ceiling, reinforcing the brand identity.\\n* **Product Placement and Pricing:** The shelves are stocked with a variety of health and beauty products, typical of a Chemist Warehouse.  Prominent brands like Colgate, Olay, and Nature\\'s Way are visible. The yellow price tags with black text are a characteristic feature of the store\\'s pricing strategy.\\n* **\"As Seen on TV\" Stickers:**  Many products feature circular stickers stating \"As Seen on TV,\" a common marketing tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.\\n* **\"Health Break\" Signage:**  The \"Health Break\" logo, a part of Chemist Warehouse\\'s branding for its health product sections, is visible on several shelves.\\n* **Metal Grid Shelving:** The metal grid shelving units are a standard fixture in Chemist Warehouse stores.\\n\\n**Composition and Details:**\\n\\nThe photograph is composed with the two men positioned centrally in the aisle, with shelves of products flanking them on both sides. This creates a sense of depth and draws the viewer\\'s eye towards the center. The aisle appears well-lit, likely due to fluorescent lighting typical of retail spaces.\\n\\nThe shelves are densely packed with products, creating a visually busy backdrop. The bright colors and varied packaging of the products contribute to the overall vibrancy of the scene.  The price tags, with their bold yellow and black design, stand out against the colorful products, emphasizing the store\\'s focus on value.\\n\\nThe \"3\" signs hanging from the ceiling, indicating further discounts, are a common promotional tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.  The \"Discount Chemist 50% Go\" sign suggests a sale or special offer on selected items.\\n\\nThe floor appears to be a light-colored tile, typical of retail environments.  A circular floor sticker, possibly indicating social distancing guidelines, is partially visible near Eno\\'s feet.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe photograph presents a striking juxtaposition of the two renowned musicians against the backdrop of a busy, everyday retail setting. The contrast between the artistic personas of Byrne and Eno and the commercial environment of Chemist Warehouse creates a sense of intrigue. The image captures a seemingly spontaneous moment, lending it a candid and unposed feel.  The vibrant colors, dense product displays, and prominent branding of Chemist Warehouse create a visually stimulating environment that further enhances the photograph\\'s impact. The presence of text throughout the image, from product names and prices to promotional slogans, adds another layer of detail and context. This photograph is not only a portrait of two influential musicians but also a snapshot of a particular time and place, capturing the essence of a ubiquitous Australian retail experience.\\n'}},\n",

He was joined by Ye, the rap star formerly known as Kanye West.\\n The show in Rome marked Ye’s first concert appearance after a series of antisemitic remarks on social media and in interviews last year led to his expulsion from social media for a time and theseries of antisemitic remarks. When he came onstage, the crowd roared and jumped some more.\\n Romans, including those living some distance from the site, took to social media to lament shaking windows, beds and chandeliers.\\n In more recent years, the Circus Maximus has played host to major open-air rock concerts, including shows by the Rolling Stones, Lady Gaga and, this summer, Bruce Springsteen, Guns N’ Roses and Imagine Dragons.\\n The circus has also hosted the summer season of Rome’s opera.\\n Giovanni Diaferia, a seismologist at the Italian Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, calculated: “60k people, 70 kg each, jumping and reaching 0.15 m from ground radiate an energy of E = 6.2 MJ which is equivalent to a magnitude 1.3 earthquake, at each jump!! Enough to be recorded by a seismic station 9 km away.”\\n On Tuesday, the institute said in an online note that its national seismic network stations “clearly registered the enthusiasm of Travis Scott fans in concert at Circus Maximus”.\\n Similar activity was registered in 2021, when Italy won the European Championship soccer final, as well as earlier this year when Naples won the Serie A championship, the institute said.\\n In July, a Taylor Swift concert in Seattle shook the ground so hard, it registered signals roughly equivalent to a magnitude 2.3 earthquake, seismologists said.\\n A seismogram identified several points during the Scott concert, which lasted under 90 minutes, “with evident peaks of jubilation” on the part of fans, according to the institute.\\n In the aftermath, Alfonsina Russo, who oversees the Archaeological Park of the Colosseum, Rome’s most important archaeological area, called on city officials to stop using the Circus Maximus for mass events and to put it to more cultural use.\\n Russo told the AGI news agency on Tuesday that the circus was a historical monument, not a stadium, and that “mega-concerts put it at risk”.\\n Archaeological experts had given advice to the city for such events, and Russo said she had expressed concerns about the decibel levels and about spectators jumping in place.\\n “In my opinion, musical events can be held, but they should be carefully chosen like opera and ballet,” she told AGI. “Rock concerts are best held in stadiums to not endanger public safety.”\\n There was a moment of panic during the Scott show. Italian news media reported that around 60 people had to be treated for eye and throat irritation, possibly because someone used pepper spray in the crowd.\\n Nearly five years ago, pepper spray used at a nightclub, where a rapper was to perform, in the central Italian town of Corinaldo led to a stampede that killed six people and left nearly 200 people injured.\\n Attempts to reach the organisers of Scott’s concert were unsuccessful.\\n In 2021, 10 people were crushed to death and hundreds more were injured at a concert by Scott at his Astroworld Festival in Houston. Scott was investigated, but a grand jury declined to indict him or others connected to the festival. A number of lawsuits against Scott and festival organisers are pending.\\n On Wednesday, Alessandro Onorato, Rome’s City Council member responsible for tourism and events, defended the mega-concerts.\\n Beyond the money spent by concertgoers visiting from around the world, he said, fees to use the Circus Maximus for concerts last year brought 2.1 million euros, or $3.5 million, into city coffers. The funds were earmarked for the city department that maintains city-owned archaeological monuments, he added.\\n Without these fees, Roman taxpayers would have to pay up, he said in a Facebook live feed. “There were zero incidents, zero people got hurt,” he said of Scott’s concert.\\n This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

He was joined by Ye, the rap star formerly known as Kanye West.</p> <p>The show in Rome marked Ye’s first concert appearance after a series of antisemitic remarks on social media and in interviews last year led to his expulsion from social media for a time and theseries of antisemitic remarks. When he came onstage, the crowd roared and jumped some more.</p> <p>Romans, including those living some distance from the site, took to social media to lament shaking windows, beds and chandeliers.</p> <p>In more recent years, the Circus Maximus has played host to major open-air rock concerts, including shows by the Rolling Stones, Lady Gaga and, this summer, Bruce Springsteen, Guns N’ Roses and Imagine Dragons.</p> <p>The circus has also hosted the summer season of Rome’s opera.</p> <p>Giovanni Diaferia, a seismologist at the Italian Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, calculated: “60k people, 70 kg each, jumping and reaching 0.15 m from ground radiate an energy of E = 6.2 MJ which is equivalent to a magnitude 1.3 earthquake, at each jump!! Enough to be recorded by a seismic station 9 km away.”</p> <p>On Tuesday, the institute said in an online note that its national seismic network stations “clearly registered the enthusiasm of Travis Scott fans in concert at Circus Maximus”.</p> <p>Similar activity was registered in 2021, when Italy won the European Championship soccer final, as well as earlier this year when Naples won the Serie A championship, the institute said.</p> <p>In July, a Taylor Swift concert in Seattle shook the ground so hard, it registered signals roughly equivalent to a magnitude 2.3 earthquake, seismologists said.</p> <p>A seismogram identified several points during the Scott concert, which lasted under 90 minutes, “with evident peaks of jubilation” on the part of fans, according to the institute.</p> <p>In the aftermath, Alfonsina Russo, who oversees the Archaeological Park of the Colosseum, Rome’s most important archaeological area, called on city officials to stop using the Circus Maximus for mass events and to put it to more cultural use.</p> <p>Russo told the AGI news agency on Tuesday that the circus was a historical monument, not a stadium, and that “mega-concerts put it at risk”.</p> <p>Archaeological experts had given advice to the city for such events, and Russo said she had expressed concerns about the decibel levels and about spectators jumping in place.</p> <p>“In my opinion, musical events can be held, but they should be carefully chosen like opera and ballet,” she told AGI. “Rock concerts are best held in stadiums to not endanger public safety.”</p> <p>There was a moment of panic during the Scott show. Italian news media reported that around 60 people had to be treated for eye and throat irritation, possibly because someone used pepper spray in the crowd.</p> <p>Nearly five years ago, pepper spray used at a nightclub, where a rapper was to perform, in the central Italian town of Corinaldo led to a stampede that killed six people and left nearly 200 people injured.</p> <p>Attempts to reach the organisers of Scott’s concert were unsuccessful.</p> <p>In 2021, 10 people were crushed to death and hundreds more were injured at a concert by Scott at his Astroworld Festival in Houston. Scott was investigated, but a grand jury declined to indict him or others connected to the festival. A number of lawsuits against Scott and festival organisers are pending.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Alessandro Onorato, Rome’s City Council member responsible for tourism and events, defended the mega-concerts.</p> <p>Beyond the money spent by concertgoers visiting from around the world, he said, fees to use the Circus Maximus for concerts last year brought 2.1 million euros, or $3.5 million, into city coffers. The funds were earmarked for the city department that maintains city-owned archaeological monuments, he added.</p> <p>Without these fees, Roman taxpayers would have to pay up, he said in a Facebook live feed. “There were zero incidents, zero people got hurt,” he said of Scott’s concert.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/09/world/europe/travis-scott-rome-earthquake.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>'}},\n",

It is unclear why — perhaps he fainted, said his son Carlo Kureishi, or perhaps he suffered an epileptic fit — but he fell awkwardly, twisting his neck and grievously injuring the top of his spine.\\n When Hanif Kureishi regained his senses, he was lying in a pool of blood, unable to move his arms or his legs.\\n “It occurred to me that there was no co-ordination between what was left of my mind and what remained of my body,” he wrote, via dictation, a few days later on Twitter. “I had become divorced from myself. I believed I was dying. I believed I had three breaths left.”\\n Taken to Gemelli Hospital, Kureishi spent the next several days “profoundly traumatised, altered and unrecognisable to myself”, he said on Twitter. “At the moment, it is unclear whether I will ever be able to walk again, or whether I’ll ever be able to hold a pen.”\\n Since then, Kureishi, 68, a novelist, screenwriter, playwright and director best known for My Beautiful Laundrette and The Buddha of Suburbia, has been dictating daily dispatches from his hospital bed.\\n In vivid, poignant prose, he is narrating his ongoing drama but also conjuring memories, musing about writing and art, and describing the terrifying, sometimes transcendent profundity of being dependent on the love and patience of others.\\n The posts are presented as series of tweets and also compiled as a Substack newsletter — postcards from an unfolding crisis. They have touched a nerve in readers, who have responded with practical advice, as well as messages of love, support and gratitude for what they say has been an extraordinary model of grace and imagination in the midst of calamity.\\n “We are all with you in this room, lying next to you on your trolley and staring at the ceiling tiles,” a Twitter user named Affi Parvizi-Wayne wrote. “Your beautiful writing transports us every day to your world.”\\n Kureishi first said he wanted to post something on social media a few days after the accident, his son said in an interview. “He’s not a private person in that respect,” Carlo Kureishi said. “He’s always been autobiographical in his writing.”\\n He started dictating, almost in the way of an old-time, pre-internet reporter phoning in a story to the office. (As he speaks, he notes the paragraph breaks, for example, by saying “new paragraph”.)\\n “It came out very naturally, very fluidly,” his son said. “I thought that was that.” But the first posts attracted a great deal of interest, in part because Hanif Kureishi was channelling the fears of so many readers.\\n “What happened to my dad is pretty much the event that’s uppermost in people’s minds of what they don’t want to happen to them,” Carlo Kureishi said.\\n The tweets are brave, profound, playful, lyrical, despairing and occasionally very funny. Mentioning an impending rectal exam, Hanif Kureishi recalled the last one he had, courtesy of the public National Health Service back in England. The nurse mistook him for Salman Rushdie.\\n “As the nurse flipped me over she asked me, ‘How long did it take you to write Midnight’s Children?’” Kureishi wrote. “I replied, ‘If I had indeed written Midnight’s Children, don’t you think I would have gone private?’”\\n As it happens, the two writers are old friends. “My friend Salman Rushdie, one of the bravest men I know, a man who has stood up to the most evil form of Islamofascism, writes to me every single day, encouraging patience,” Kureishi wrote in one Twitter post. “He should know,” he added, a reference to the vicious stabbing attack on Rushdie last summer. “He gives me courage.”\\n Kureishi is about to move to a specialty rehabilitation hospital, and his recovery is likely to be arduous and uncertain. After an operation on his neck to reduce some of the swelling around his spinal cord, he has regained glimmers of movement in his legs and the tips of his fingers, his son said. No one has made a definitive prognosis, though a physical therapist recently “promised that I would raise a pen again with my right hand”, Kureishi wrote on Thursday.\\n The author has been grappling daily with the recalibration of his closest relationships — with his three sons, his wife, and his ex-wife, producer Tracey Scoffield, to whom he remains close. “This bomb has also shattered the lives of those around me,” he wrote.\\n “People love to be kind and help one another,” he added. “They also resent their dependence on each other and the fact they can’t do everything for themselves. My accident was a physical tragedy, but the emotional outcomes for all of us are going to be significant, but also very interesting.”\\n In one of his posts, Kureishi talked about his love of the physical act of putting pen to paper, how he likes to “write a word, a sentence, then another sentence, until I feel something wake up inside me”.\\n “As I make these marks, I begin to hear characters speaking, and then they start speaking to each other if I’m lucky; if I’m even luckier, they might start amusing one another,” he continued. “I’m sure many painters, writers, architects, sports people and gardeners love their tools, and see their tools as an extension of their body.\\n “I hope one day I will be able to go back to using my own precious and beloved instruments.”\\n This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

You’ll have no trouble imagining how even love might cause such a rift after reading Hila Blum’s How to Love Your Daughter. It begins with Yoella, spying upon her daughter Leah (and two grandchildren she has never met) having dinner in an Amsterdam suburb. She has flown from her home in Israel, many years after Leah cut her out of her life without a word, and flies back again after a tantalising glimpse of her child, determined to make sense of what went wrong between them. In this sense, it is a detective novel in which suspect and sleuth are one and the same. Disquiet builds as Yoella sifts through the past for clues, dredging up memories of her late husband Meir, and the family’s life together as Leah grew up. A tenuous hope survives this quietly observed examination of how maternal love can misfire, stifling what it strives to nurture.\\n Audition\\nPip Adam, Giramondo, $29.95\\n Three giants hurtle through the galaxy aboard the spaceship Audition. Alba, Stanley and Drew have grown and will continue to grow unless they talk, which they do unceasingly, both to restrain their alarming bodily expansion and to fuel their vessel as it searches for a new home among the stars. Blending science fiction and social realism, Pip Adam’s Audition is an audacious novel that gives voice to the marginalised and underprivileged, and as the enforced stream of chatter burgeons, it becomes clear each of the giants is a social outcast jettisoned from Earth as punishment. It can be a tough read – the dialogue writhes between small talk and desperate confession with limited insight; it often rides waves of inarticulacy. And yet this bleak experimental fable arrives at new possibilities, the implied critique of the society from which the characters have been exiled yielding to alien worlds. It won’t be for everyone, but there’s a bold integrity to this outlier of a novel that will attract writers and readers interested in pushing the limits of genre.\\n Vincent & Sien\\nSilvia Kwon, Macmillan, $34.99 \\n More has been unearthed over the past few years about the biography of Sien Hoornik, Vincent van Gogh’s only live-in lover, but many details remain sketchy and a novelistic treatment has plenty of gaps for the imagination to fill. Silvia Kwon takes us to The Hague in 1882, where the struggling artist first takes in Sien and her young daughter on a bitterly cold winter’s night. They will live together for 18 months, Vincent entranced by her strength of personality and the hardships endured in her former life as a sex worker. Sien takes on the role of model and muse – to survive, though she is convinced she will die by her own hand – but as the connection between the couple deepens, they face intense hostility from Vincent’s immediate family. Novels portraying artists and muses, especially those paying attention to the woman’s perspective, are almost a subgenre in themselves, and this one should appeal to art lovers curious for insight into a formative relationship involving a famously tormented artistic genius.\\n God Forgets About the Poor\\nPeter Polites, Ultimo Press, $34.99\\n A tender novel about a migrant mother, God Forgets About the Poor starts winningly in the imperative mood … as if the writer’s mother were bossing him about, offering unsolicited advice and anecdotes about why and how her story should be told. The tale stretches from poverty and civil war – hardships difficult for the mother’s descendants in Australia to imagine – in a remote mountain village on a Greek island. The contrast with 21st century Sydney couldn’t be starker. Villagers confront death as an inescapable reality: they’re bound together by the struggle to survive, the beauty of the landscape, intensity of religious feeling. This imagined Greek village is draped not in nostalgia but a vibrant earthiness, a dignity in the face of conditions that were anything but dignified. Peter Polites is also sensitive to the ways in which migrant stories can be reduced, stereotyped and consumed in mainstream publishing, and is at pains to give voice to the complexity and richness of his subject’s experience.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nMy Mother, The Spy\\nCindy Dobbin & Freda Marnie Nicholls, Allen & Unwin, $34.99\\n Mercia Masson, journalist and spy, mother of Cindy Dobbin, started working for naval intelligence in 1943 and was later recruited by ASIO to report on the Communist Party and suspected spy rings. But her daughter knew virtually nothing about Mercia’s double life (and she emerges as a cold and distant mother) until after she died. Mind you, Masson had been exposed in 1955 by the Petrov Royal Commission, because of which she claimed to have “lost everything”. For the most part, though, this is a realistic portrait of the humdrum activities of most spy work, all written in the third person from the point of view of the daughter trying to discover who her mother was. Among other things, it asks the question if the clandestine life of operatives is imposed on them by the secrecy of their work, or whether certain types are drawn to it.\\n Your Name Is Not Anxious\\nStephanie Dowrick, Allen & Unwin, $29.99\\n Frederick Nietzsche famously called his chronic pain “dog”, attempting to control it as you would a pet. Stephanie Dowrick, writer and psychotherapist, addressing the reader – in particular anyone suffering anxiety – directly as “you”, makes a similar point. “You” are in control and this, basically, is a handbook for self-therapy. Chronic anxiety “colonises” the sufferer, making them feel powerless. The task is to “de-colonise” yourself and put anxiety in its place through self-therapy (not ruling out consultative therapy). At the core of this is getting in contact with the total of your being, physical, intellectual and spiritual, contextualising anxiety and, among other things, being kind to yourself. Using case studies and personal history she expertly guides the reader through complex material, making perfect sense.\\n Shake Some Action\\nStuart Coupe, Penguin, $35\\n\\nNot many people can claim to have saved Richard Ford’s life, but Stuart Coupe can, after the American writer looked the wrong way before crossing the street and was hauled back by Coupe, supposedly in the nick of time. This book is mainly a catalogue of encounters, largely as music writer and manager, in the rock business. And it’s an impressive catalogue, from the spectacular (hanging out backstage with Bruce Springsteen in Paris, not to mention Mick Jagger), to the seedy (observing roadies selecting female fans in the ’70s for an unnamed band’s pleasure). It’s also, to some extent, an incidental retrieval of how journalism has changed over the decades – Coupe recounting his experience of taking copy into the newspaper office and handing it to the editor. Woven into this is his Launceston childhood and the origins of his passion for music writing.\\n The World of Sugar\\nUlbe Bosma, Belknap Press, $63.95\\n\\nOnce, like salt and pepper, the granules extracted from cane known as “white gold” were a luxury only the richest could savour. But from the middle ages a massive industry evolved, to the extent that today the average European consumes 40 kilos of sugar a year (60 in the US). It is an industry with a seriously dark past and a menacing present in terms of world health, WHO declaring sugar-driven obesity a pandemic in 1999. Ulbe Bosma’s history of sugar is also a case study of global capitalism over the centuries, colonial wars, and the deadly slave trade that made the industry possible. It may be a history of a sweet substance, but it has a bitter aftertaste. Like most studies that tell us how rubber, salt and paper changed the world, it’s formulaic. But it’s an interesting account of how sugar seeped into the global digestive system.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

And it’s an impressive catalogue, from the spectacular (hanging out backstage with Bruce Springsteen in Paris, not to mention Mick Jagger), to the seedy (observing roadies selecting female fans in the ’70s for an unnamed band’s pleasure). It’s also, to some extent, an incidental retrieval of how journalism has changed over the decades – Coupe recounting his experience of taking copy into the newspaper office and handing it to the editor. Woven into this is his Launceston childhood and the origins of his passion for music writing.</p> <p><em><strong>The World of Sugar</strong></em><br/><strong>Ulbe Bosma, Belknap Press, $63.95<br/></strong><br/>Once, like salt and pepper, the granules extracted from cane known as “white gold” were a luxury only the richest could savour. But from the middle ages a massive industry evolved, to the extent that today the average European consumes 40 kilos of sugar a year (60 in the US). It is an industry with a seriously dark past and a menacing present in terms of world health, WHO declaring sugar-driven obesity a pandemic in 1999. Ulbe Bosma’s history of sugar is also a case study of global capitalism over the centuries, colonial wars, and the deadly slave trade that made the industry possible. It may be a history of a sweet substance, but it has a bitter aftertaste. Like most studies that tell us how rubber, salt and paper changed the world, it’s formulaic. But it’s an interesting account of how sugar seeped into the global digestive system.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>'}},\n",

Kit is a buff, charming photographer who has always preferred casual sex to steady relationships, and Michael (Jim Parsons) is a nerdy vegetarian who drinks Diet Coke and wears button-down shirts buttoned up. He’s an entertainment journalist with a special interest in sitcoms and soaps. And that’s not all. When Kit is finally permitted to visit his apartment, he finds that it’s been colonised by the Smurf collection Ausiello has been acquiring since childhood.\\n Ausiello wrote the book after Kit’s death. It grew from a series of Facebook posts read by the couple’s family and friends, one of whom was an editor at Simon & Schuster. And Showalter has succeeded in catching its spirit – its intimacy, its self-deprecating sense of humour and Ausiello’s habit of seeing life through the prism of the television shows he loved as a kid. Both his parents died when he was young and the shows take him back to the times when he was at his happiest. So, too, does the Smurf collection.\\n Kit’s parents are very much alive. His mother, Marilyn (Sally Field) competes in triathlons – despite her stately pace and dodgy knees – and his father, Bob (Bill Irwin) is kept busy carrying out his wife’s orders. Kit’s relationship with Michael finally gives him the courage to tell them that he’s gay and they do better than approve. They embrace Michael as a surrogate son.\\n The film is episodic in shape. The couple go through many ups and downs during the 13 years they spend together and the script canvasses them all. Sometimes the tone is a little too cute but Showalter (The Eyes of Tammy Faye) and his writers have a persuasive ability to defuse the looming threat of sentimentality with comedy.\\n Aldridge is terrific as the easy-going Kit, who’s been blessed with such physical confidence that the disease comes as both shock and betrayal, and Field knows exactly when to rein in the indomitable Marilyn.

When he looked up, comedian Nick Offerman and author George Saunders were looking down at him with concern on their faces.\\n No, this wasn’t a dream. This actually happened four years ago on a five-day hike in Glacier National Park in Montana, when the Wilco frontman slipped on melting ice.\\n Yes, Tweedy is “pals”, as he puts it, with the star of Parks And Recreation and the Booker Prize-winning writer.\\n “I met Nick when I appeared on Parks And Rec,” says Tweedy, reclining on a couch in his basement in Chicago after a day of rehearsals with Wilco for their upcoming world tour, a cat-shaped pillow behind his head and a collection of his late father’s electronic gadgets lining the shelves.\\n “Apparently the conversation in the writers’ room went something like, ‘We need to find an ageing, washed-up rock star.’ And someone else said, ‘someone like Jeff Tweedy?’ And someone else said, ′Well, why don’t we just ask Jeff Tweedy?’”\\n Offerman interviewed Tweedy and Saunders separately for his book Gumption, about 21 Americans who had shaped his world. Tweedy met Saunders when the two appeared on the final episode of The Colbert Report, along with a rollcall of over 100 guests that included Cookie Monster, Willie Nelson, Cyndi Lauper, George Lucas and Henry Kissinger.\\n “George is one of my favourite authors, so I went searching for him backstage,” recalls Tweedy. “I saw him come out of the door of one of the dressing rooms and I said, ‘You’re the person I’m most excited to meet here.’ And he said, ‘Well, I was just coming to find you.’ It was very romantic.”\\n Saunders told Tweedy he had listened to the sprawling Wilco song One Sunday Morning (Song For Jane Smiley’s Boyfriend) over and over every day while writing some of the stories in his collection Tenth Of December.\\n He went on to write a piece about the song for The New York Times Magazine in 2016, calling it “a reliable 12-minute prayer” and calling Tweedy “one of the great conversational poets of our time.”\\n It wasn’t long before “a three-way bromance” (Offerman’s words in an interview with Stephen Colbert) was instigated, starting with long text threads between the trio, and culminating in the hike, which made its way into Offerman’s latest book, Where The Deer And The Antelope Play.\\n Tweedy himself is also on a roll in the book-writing department. He has already published two – the 2018 memoir Let’s Go (So We Can Get Back) and 2020’s How To Write One Song.\\n The latter is a revealing and generous book about the creative process and why he thinks everyone should do it. He writes about pushing your ego out of the way and creating for the sake of creativity, and the feeling of disappearing when you’re truly in the moment.\\n I point out that people also use drugs to disappear. Tweedy, 56, used to be addicted to prescription opiates he took for crippling migraines. How did things change for him creatively when he got sober 19 years ago?\\n “It would be more accurate to say that I created those older songs in spite of being an addict,” he says. “Those issues I had were a distraction and sapped my energy, but the part of myself I was writing from was the part that was there before I did drugs. It was the part of me that was childlike and wanted a song to sing. That was the big revelation for me when I got sober. And that’s why I can still sing those songs and not feel like they were written by a different person.“\\n Wilco are a self-sufficient band with their own studio, The Loft. But for the latest Wilco album, Cousin, they invited Welsh singer-songwriter Cate Le Bon to produce.\\n “I met Cate when she played Solid Sound (the Massachusetts festival Tweedy curates) in 2019,” he says. “We performed an Arthur Russell song and Strangers by The Kinks together and hit it off right away. Then whenever Cate and her band came through Chicago on tour they would either stay at The Loft or use it for rehearsals. She just became part of the family.\\n “And when I heard her version of the Wilco song Company In My Back, which she recorded at The Loft for a cover-mount CD for Mojo magazine, it blew me away because it was such an imaginative arrangement and a unique sound. So I thought I’d ask her to produce us.“\\n A couple of the new songs are among the most politically pointed Tweedy has penned. Ten Dead came from a news story he saw on TV about yet another US school shooting.\\n “The reporter literally said ‘only 10 dead’,” says Tweedy, slowly shaking his head. “He almost had this tone of disappointment that it wasn’t a bigger news story. Or maybe he was saying ‘Well, it’s good that it was only ten.’ Either way, it was an appalling thing to say.\\n “And look, I know we hear people singing songs about things like this and go, ‘Oh yeah, the world was really waiting for you to weigh in on this. Thank you for appropriating someone else’s trauma.’ But I was trying to highlight the insanity of this becoming so matter-of-fact. The rational response to this is ‘No, this can’t happen anymore.’ It’s painfully obvious what we should do about it. Instead, we hear people talking about giving kids bulletproof backpacks.”\\n The title track is close to home, aimed at relatives who expressed far-right views after Donald Trump came to power.\\n “It’s really more about my dad than me. Before he died (in 2017) he saw family members turn their backs on democracy and decency. They felt emboldened to express their bigotry. It was something that deeply upset my father. He wasn’t a liberal by any means. He grew up in southern Illinois and he worked on the railroad. But he was decent and smart and thought Trump was what he called ‘a boss’s son’. And, in his mind, there was nothing worse than that.“\\n Tweedy has a third book due out in November. The World Within A Song will be his deep dive into 50 songs by other artists. Despite the fact he had already written a memoir, he found this book ended up being even more autobiographical, “because songs become part of our own biography, they work their way into our memories and self-image.”\\n Many of Tweedy’s choices will be unsurprising to those who follow his work: Mavis Staples, The Replacements, Dolly Parton, the Velvet Underground. But a couple may put the cat among Wilco’s “dad rock” contingent – and perhaps educate them.\\n “I chose I Love You by Billie Eilish, because, like a lot of her songs, it has this majestic, sublime melody. I think she and her brother would have been successful songwriters and performers in any era. Her songs are like jazz or torch songs, but she’s extremely modern.\\n “And I chose a song by Rosalia because I think she may be the greatest artist walking the earth right now. She has this incredible gift and she made this quantum leap from studying flamenco as a young girl to basically reinventing reggaeton music. It’s like she’s Miles Davis or Pablo Picasso. She had to be in the book.”\\n Cousin is out now. Wilco play The Forum in Melbourne on March 16, 17 and 18; the Sydney Opera House on March 22 and the Enmore Theatre on November 22.\\n'}},\n",

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nGreen Dot\\nMadeleine Gray, Allen & Unwin, $32.99\\n This Gen Z novel has all the trappings of a Bridget Jones-style romcom though its young heroine is cleverer, more cynical, and more hopelessly trapped, not only by the apparent unreachability of anything like a stable income, but by the anxieties and rationalisations underneath all the sass. Hera Stephen has reached her mid-twenties and rather enjoys her job, despite being miserably paid, as a comment moderator in a Sydney newsroom. She falls for a nerdy, older married colleague, Arthur. Like everyone else in her life, Hera has seen that story before – how could she not have? – but goes for it anyway. Madeleine Gray’s Green Dot stands out from a pack of “hot mess” novels for its wit and sensitivity, the singularity of the voice, the way it resists cliché. Some readers will be frustrated by Hera, who seems besotted by failure as much as the “ordinary happiness” Arthur appears to represent, but as she navigates questions of success, adulthood, and love itself, it’s hard not to admire her.\\n\\n\\n The Last Devil to Die\\nRichard Osman, Viking, $34.99\\n The popular Thursday Murder Club series continues in this fourth book. If you’re unfamiliar, it features a group of elderly amateur sleuths solving crimes from what proves to be the most lethal retirement village in the land.\\n Former spook Elizabeth Best, union man Ron Ritchie, nurse Joyce Meadowcroft, and psychiatrist Ibrahim Arif are at it again. In The Last Devil to Die, a character who assisted them in a previous investigation is found murdered, and a heroin shipment has vanished into thin air. The gang has a wealth of experience between them, and are accustomed to leveraging the fact that codgers and little old ladies tend to be underestimated or ignored. The team must find the killer as the body count rises, even as one member faces their own rapid decline. Newcomers should start at the beginning, and fans will be pleased to know the author has promised to complete another instalment.\\n The Love Contract\\nSteph Vizard, HarperCollins, $22.99\\n Steph Vizard’s The Love Contract nimbly stitches the tropes of romantic fiction onto the modern crisis in childcare. After her long-term relationship breaks down, Zoe decides to go it alone as a single mum. Crunch-time comes when she must return to work but can’t find anyone to mind little Hazel. Enter her neighbour and nemesis, Will – an arrogant lawyer whose boss mistakes Zoe for Will’s wife and insists that he take parental leave. The situation might solve all their problems, assuming Zoe and Will can put down their swords long enough to fake a romantic relationship, and Will cares for the tot while Zoe’s at work, of course. True to form, they draw up a contract. What seems cut and dry on paper runs into love’s fine print: there’s only so long you fake it till you make it. Vizard is clearly a Janeite, and though her novel can’t match the wit or observation of Austen, it adapts the timeless perversities of the human heart into a contemporary context, in a finely constructed narrative that readers will breeze through.\\n Light Over Liskeard\\nLouis de Bernières, Harvill Secker, $34.99\\n My prize for the year’s most irritating dystopia goes to Louis de Bernières’ Light Over Liskeard. The author of Captain Corelli’s Mandolin is no stranger to eccentric dead ends – Red Dog consisted of silly short tales about an Australian kelpie, for instance – but this confection seems such a half-hearted blob of misanthropic whimsy it’s a wonder he finished it at all. Arthur, or “Q”, is a middle-aged quantum cryptographer warned of an imminent technological crisis. He retreats to rural Cornwall where he converts a rundown farmhouse into an elaborate bunker to survive the coming apocalypse. Quirky characters bustle through the moors, among them an Edwardian schoolgirl’s ghost, a survivalist Scot, the rugged park ranger Theo, and his daughter Eva, an artist who runs everywhere and somehow develops an interest in Q the reader struggles to share. If the author intended to extol simple country life over a technological hellscape, he fails. Glimpses of the city (an indolent populace titillated by sexbots, tormented by fully automated restaurants) are more fun, with genuine satiric potential.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nMy Father’s Shadow\\nSandra Goldbloom Zurbo, Monash University Publishing, $32.99\\n Sandra Goldbloom Zurbo’s evocative, often moving study of her complex relationship with her father is as much a homage as a memoir. Samuel Goldbloom was a Jewish, Moscow-line communist whose politics touched every part of domestic life when she was growing up in Melbourne.\\n “Everything is political,” Samuel lectured at dinners. She admired him (treated the line as gospel, and travelled overseas with him for political events), and rebelled against him. He could be supporting and loving, but there were also “wollopings” for transgressions and sarcastic putdowns. He cast a long shadow, but she discovers a kind of resolution in his death and its wake, finding solace in knowing that through it all they loved each other.\\n Alan Joyce & Qantas\\nPeter Harbison, with Derek Sadubin, Penguin, $36.99\\n There has been no more spectacular fall from corporate grace in recent years than that of Qantas, from beloved national icon to trashed brand. And it was Alan Joyce in the pilot seat. This mix of biography and career assessment is an attempt to contextualise Joyce’s time in charge, Peter Harbison pointing out that the first part of this century was either disastrous or seriously testing for airlines worldwide (Air New Zealand went bust and the state had to acquire it), and concludes that “in seeking to make the airline bulletproof, Joyce surely couldn’t have done much better”. Scandal, inquest, sackings and severe customer backlash notwithstanding, he is optimistic that “Qantas’s reputation will recover faster than most would expect”. Others might suggest that pigs, as well as kangaroos, might fly too.\\n Abortion Care is Health Care\\nBarbara Baird, MUP, $40\\n “It is estimated,” says Barbara Baird, “that between one in three and one in four Australian women will have an abortion during their lifetime.” Baird does not address the moral dimension of the abortion issue, which has long been decided, the majority of Australians being “pro-choice”. The main question her book addresses is why there is a lag between public opinion and public health in providing abortion care, abortions – emblematic of what she calls “neoliberal abortion” – being provided “predominantly” by the private sector, at cost to the patient, and favours urban dwellers rather than those in rural and remote communities. She incorporates interviews and case studies (one, a Cairns woman arrested in 2009 for taking abortion medication), and while there is some unnecessary jargon it is accessibly written.\\n Our Fragile Moment\\nMichael Mann, Scribe, $35\\n It is ironic, says Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann, that it was climate change (the impact of a massive asteroid 65 million years ago) that made humanity and our Goldilocks Earth possible – and it’s climate change that may well imperil it.\\n In this combination of science and history, he says the past can help us understand the current challenge. He cites case studies such as the collapse of the Akkadian Empire because of severe drought, but also cautions that we need to embrace “scientific uncertainty” and that answers to climate-change questions aren’t always “cut and dried”. In this sense, he seeks to occupy a middle ground between two extremes – denialism (aided by the conservative media, especially News Corp) and doomism – in addressing the reality of climate change. Mann can qualify his arguments a bit much, but this is timely.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. Get it delivered every Friday.\\n'}},\n",

Others might suggest that pigs, as well as kangaroos, might fly too.</p> <p><em><strong>Abortion Care is Health Care</strong></em><br/><strong>Barbara Baird, MUP, $40</strong></p> <p>“It is estimated,” says Barbara Baird, “that between one in three and one in four Australian women will have an abortion during their lifetime.” Baird does not address the moral dimension of the abortion issue, which has long been decided, the majority of Australians being “pro-choice”. The main question her book addresses is why there is a lag between public opinion and public health in providing abortion care, abortions – emblematic of what she calls “neoliberal abortion” – being provided “predominantly” by the private sector, at cost to the patient, and favours urban dwellers rather than those in rural and remote communities. She incorporates interviews and case studies (one, a Cairns woman arrested in 2009 for taking abortion medication), and while there is some unnecessary jargon it is accessibly written.</p> <p><em><strong>Our Fragile Moment</strong></em><br/><strong>Michael Mann, Scribe, $35</strong></p> <p>It is ironic, says Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann, that it was climate change (the impact of a massive asteroid 65 million years ago) that made humanity and our Goldilocks Earth possible – and it’s climate change that may well imperil it.</p> <p>In this combination of science and history, he says the past can help us understand the current challenge. He cites case studies such as the collapse of the Akkadian Empire because of severe drought, but also cautions that we need to embrace “scientific uncertainty” and that answers to climate-change questions aren’t always “cut and dried”. In this sense, he seeks to occupy a middle ground between two extremes – denialism (aided by the conservative media, especially News Corp) and doomism – in addressing the reality of climate change. Mann can qualify his arguments a bit much, but this is timely.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>'}},\n",

The skill of these journalists is such that they can verify, produce and distribute a story to you in the time it takes a hygienic person to clean their teeth.\\n Some of these names you will know. Caroline Schelle is our morning blogger and uses her shrewd judgement to turn the relentless stream of national news into Caroline Schelle with skill, speed and accuracy. Our breaking reporters, such as the talented Caroline Schelle, will hit the phones to verify news tips or be dispatched to the scene to file “colour” to add texture to a story.\\n They are ably supported by a host of people whose names you probably don’t know.

Our digital editor, Daniella Miletic coordinates the production and delivery of stories online, finessing headlines and selecting the right images, with the help of our excellent digital production team.

Yesterday, chief football writer Jake Niall called me with a big story, confirming that Alastair Clarkson had stepped away from his coaching role at North Melbourne to look after his wellbeing. Minutes later, for many of you, the first version of that story arrived in your pocket with a buzz or a ding.\\n Even now, as I write this, another resignation has taken many by surprise. Host of the ABC’s Q+A program and veteran broadcaster Stan Grant has just stepped down from his role, citing racist abuse amid complaints about the public broadcaster’s coverage of the coronation of King Charles. A discussion between relevant editors is flowing in the newsroom, considering how to cover the story and whose insights might be most valuable to our readers.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'In a second-storey room of a Brunswick building I must have walked past dozens of times without noticing, Richard Mills is creating music.\\n Books are stacked neatly around the place, a piano stands off to one side, a desk is strewn with papers, and curled up on a chair is the accomplished composer and conductor’s dog, Buddy, who is his constant companion through the process of writing an opera from scratch.\\n Walking Buddy, who is one of the loveliest dogs you’ll ever meet, and getting a coffee are the two main breaks from writing Mills takes. The rest of the time he is immersed in the musical world he is creating.\\n “Writing music is really hard work. It takes time and concentration, and it takes isolation,” he says. “You can’t be talking to people – you’ve got to sit and do it quietly away from outside influences.”\\n When we meet, Mills is in the process of composing Galileo, a new work that will also mark his final production as artistic director of Victorian Opera after 11 years in the role. He will, however, be staying close to music. It’s impossible, he agrees, to ever retire from a vocation.\\n Though he is wrapping up his tenure, his passion for the art form is just as fiery as ever. He’s steadfast about the importance of opera and, while proud of what Victorian Opera has been contributing, feels that is a significant distance between where we are and where we should be in the art form as a state.\\n “Opera’s part of that continuum of the imagination – and a society without imagination has no future,” he says. “It happens to contain some of the greatest thoughts penned by human beings … It opens a window on the marvellous to a community … it creates opportunities to see the world in a different way.”\\n Every Victorian Opera program balances past and present, with an emphasis on spotlighting local talent both on the stage and behind the pen. “We were doing everything … this state government’s wanted to do long before they even published an arts policy, because it’s the right thing to do. I mean, we should be working with First Nations, we should be responsible to our community, we should be doing education. We should be doing accessible, meaningful work for families. We’re doing all of that – we always have. ”\\n That said, he feels there is more that could be done. “Every city that aspires to be an important centre has an opera company – and Melbourne should have a properly articulated state company at about $10 or $12 million a year. That would serve the city well, and the whole community,” says Mills.\\n At present, while Victoria has several local opera companies, there isn’t a dedicated state opera with that level of funding. Instead the role is filled in part by Victorian Opera, which was founded in 2005 and currently receives about $4.8 million in local and federal funding, and in part by Opera Australia, which formed when the Victoria State Opera merged with the Australian Opera in 1996 but is not Victoria-focused.\\n Mills also has his eye on the bigger picture beyond Victorian Opera. His views are firm and clear: pathways for young musicians and composers have become more tortuous and opaque, venues for performance are inadequate, government funding for performing arts is inadequate and spaces for emerging artists to experiment and create have all but disappeared.\\n “I feel incredibly fortunate when I was starting out as a young composer,” he says. “I’m not a great composer, I’m a good craftsman … I was lucky to be given opportunities at a time when it was much easier,” he says.\\n “The orchestras in those days were not run as businesses. They were broadcasting orchestras. So they had a lot of time to play Australian music.”\\n He has spoken before about how badly Melbourne needs its own opera house, and when asked about this – and where it should go – he doesn’t hesitate. “Fishermans Bend. It’s going to be a major hub.” He explains how a few years back he started work on a design made of shipping containers, then worked with Alan Pert from the University of Melbourne’s design school to work on a mock-up for another idea. “A 1200 seater.”\\n At present, Victorian Opera performs at the Palais and the Arts Centre. “The trouble with the Arts Centre is it would cost $250,000 a fortnight and it’s just too big. Opera needs to be on a human scale. In a resonant space, the voice sounds beautiful,” he says. “The Arts Centre, of course, is full of carpet [and] carpet’s a natural enemy of voice.”\\n The venue issue extends beyond companies like Victorian Opera needing places to perform finished work, he emphasises.\\n “There’s no sandpit in Melbourne for the younger generation, the emerging generation, to make stuff and try things,” he says.\\n “Barrie Kosky, when he first started out, made shows and put them on in garages, in service stations, but … we’ve destroyed all those old industrial spaces that the young practitioners could rent. It’s why the whole Fishermans Bend thing is incredibly important, because this city needs a sandpit – it needs a place for emerging talent to manifest itself without punitive cost structures.”\\n Mills is grateful for the time and space he had in his musical education to hone his craft, and this week his newest work, Galileo, has its concert premiere at the Palais.\\n He was drawn to the story of the Italian polymath because “it seems to me that it is a story for our time”.\\n Galileo was a pioneer in the field of astronomy whose work found him tried by the Roman Inquisition and falling out of favour with the pope. His final years were spent under house arrest.\\n Even so, Mills was repeatedly asked why Galileo – why not Giordano Bruno? “It’s much more dramatic because Bruno was burned as a heretic,” he says. But for Mills, the story that can be woven from Galileo’s life is “much more nuanced and much more dimensional”. He was drawn in by the complexity.\\n “It’s a story about the search for truth, and the meaning of truth. It’s the relation of truth and politics. It’s also a story about a spiritual quest. It’s a story about the possibility of faith. It’s a story about all of this taking place in a constantly shifting environment that was, you know, negotiating the plague. Think about it. What’s changed?”\\n Galileo, a new opera in concert, will be performed by Victorian Opera on December 20 at the Palais Theatre.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

Her comedy is, above all, knowing. Winnie in Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days is a very different creature.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'It’s a near-impossible task, but the finished list is worth the struggle. In compiling Netflix’s 20 essential shows, I had a few simple parameters: scripted only (no documentaries or reality fare), mix the signature hits with the lesser-known, and recognise the breadth of the streaming service’s programming. Your favourite show might not be here, then again neither is mine.\\n Beef\\n Starting with a road rage incident and escalating to vengeful pranks, this black farce about a pair of Los Angeles residents – played by Ali Wong and Steven Yeun – appears to be a barbed contemporary comedy, but scene by scene it goes deeper into the characters, their failings, and ultimately their connection. It is a masterful, arresting transformation.\\n Black Mirror\\n Charlie Brooker’s science-fiction anthology debuted 12 years ago, which means that some of the dystopian concepts he built each season’s handful of episodes around no longer feel like mordant speculation. But the best episodes – start with San Junipero – still resonate in ways both fascinating and fearful, and the show’s evolution is fascinating to trace.\\n Bodyguard\\n Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio pushed his talent for tense thrillers punctuated by whiplash reveals to the limits with this limited series about a British personal protection officer and traumatised war veteran (Richard Madden, in his finest performance) assigned to a hard-as-nails cabinet minister (Keeley Hawes). The dynamic between the two is one of many combustible elements here.\\n BoJack Horseman\\n Hollywood satires tend to be snarky and short-sighted, so naturally it took an animated series where the Los Angeles subjects are anthropomorphic animals to really twist the knife. Daft at first encounter, full of visual delights, and psychologically acute, the story of the titular equine sitcom star (perfectly voiced by Will Arnett) dug deeper across six seasons than most prestige dramas ever could.\\n Borgen\\n The definitive political drama of the 21st century, this Danish series originally aired for three seasons between 2010 and 2013, with its depiction of power – how to wield it, what it costs – gripping when intermixed with piquant characters. Netflix added a sharply drawn fourth season last year, and the show’s many telling observations remain relevant.\\n The Crown\\n The closer this historic drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II has got to the present day, the more its spell has dissipated. Nonetheless, Peter Morgan’s royal drama is one of Netflix’s signature shows and the Claire Foy and Olivia Colman eras as Her Majesty are sumptuous character studies of privilege, contradiction and immaculate insults.\\n Dark\\n Seriously, don’t be flippant with this dense German drama: you’re in for three seasons of increasingly complex narratives, as events in an orderly town are tied together through time travel patterns every 33 years. It is bleakly gripping – mournful cellos yes, humour no – as kidnapped children and temporal conspiracies abound, but its depiction of regret and inevitability is also tragically beautiful.\\n Derry Girls\\n Has there ever been a sitcom as silly and yet sublime as Lisa McGee’s ode to her 1990s high school misadventures in Northern Ireland during the final years of sectarian conflict. Historic events and being banned from the local chippy intertwine as a group of teenage girls – and their plus-one male English cousin – plot wildly and act badly. The funniest coming of age tale going.\\n The Good Place\\n A classic American network sitcom in structure – 22-minute episodes! – loaded with inventive ideas, ingenious gags and moral quandaries, the four seasons of this metaphysical comedy find a group of wayward strangers exploring the afterlife. It is in turn nutty, soulful, and stacked with note-perfect performances (take a bow, Ted Danson).\\n The Haunting of Hill House\\n Filmmaker turned showrunner Mike Flanagan is Netflix’s resident horror auteur: year after year he updates classic horror tales or modifies the genre. My pick of his limited series is the first, which matches a group of siblings’ haunted house experience as children with their experience as emotionally damaged adults. Much is terrifying here, including familial bonds.\\n Hilda\\n Gorgeously animated – words to the effect of “Hayao Miyazaki in Scandinavia” are rightfully found in many reviews – the two seasons of this children’s series follow the adventures of the titular 11-year-old (voiced by The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey). The tone can be bittersweet or chaotic, as Hilda’s outings go from the mundane to the fantastical and she begins to comprehend the wider world’s flaws.\\n I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson\\n After three seasons of this genius sketch comedy series, it’s got to the point where I laugh so uncontrollably hard that my oldest son simply calls out “Tim Robinson” from another room. Absurd but always a step ahead of your expectations, Robinson’s pieces explore the extremes of social limits.\\n Monty Python’s Flying Circus\\n Tom Robinson, and many other sketch comics, wouldn’t have a career if it wasn’t for this feted troupe of British comics. Netflix has all four seasons of their BBC show, which debuted in 1969 and paved the way for their classic film comedies, and while time and a changing society has shaded certain numbers, there is still one-of-a-kind brilliance here.\\n Mindhunter\\n When the two circles on your Venn diagram are filmmaker David Fincher and infamous serial killers of the 1970s, you’re in for an intense series. A study of detail and dread, this impeccable psychological thriller follows a pair of outlier FBI agents and a female psychology professor interviewing jailed mass murderers such as Son of Sam.\\n Never Have I Ever\\n Netflix recently wrapped up, with a satisfying mix of teenage realisation and timeless awkwardness, this coming-of-age comic-drama, as Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and her pals finished high school. Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher’s show was always funny, but it grew more perceptive about its Indian-American lead and the rigours of adolescence with each season. Bonus: an amazing celebrity narrator.\\n Seinfeld\\n The era-defining sitcoms of the 1990s are lucrative trophies in the streaming era, with Netflix currently home to all 180 episodes of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David’s celebrated comedy about a group of New Yorkers with the worst of intentions. Riffing off minor misunderstandings and friendly misdemeanours, this 20th century classic has episodes assembled with clockwork precision and hilarious send-offs.\\n Squid Game\\n The games without frontiers that punctuated this shocking and addictive drama turned Netflix’s South Korean production arm from stealth success to superstar. With a harsh undercurrent of inequality fuelling the fantastical limits, a group of strangers find themselves in an underground competition where children’s games are literally a matter of life and death.\\n Stateless\\n A funding arrangement means that Netflix ends up taking the ABC’s scripted shows to the world, while providing a valuable second chance locally. It means you can rediscover this coruscating 2020 drama about Australia’s refugee detention regime, with co-creator Cate Blanchett in a supporting role. The multiple storylines deliver startling detail and unadorned empathy.\\n Stranger Things\\n Netflix’s biggest shows – and few are bigger than this 1980s supernatural horror homage – have redefined what a successful global franchise can be. Strip-mining their favourite movies of the era, creators the Duffer Brothers created a popcorn panopticon that’s become a streaming event even as recent seasons took their time getting up to speed.\\n Unbelievable\\n Here are your truest detectives. Based on real-life events, Toni Collette and Merritt Wever are riveting as Colorado police officers who partner up to catch a serial rapist. Their relentless search is an exceptional procedural, but it’s elevated by the heart-rending parallel story of a survivor (Kaitlyn Dever) trying to endure a system meant to help her.\\n Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.

With a harsh undercurrent of inequality fuelling the fantastical limits, a group of strangers find themselves in an underground competition where children’s games are literally a matter of life and death.</p> <p><strong>Stateless</strong></p> <p>A funding arrangement means that Netflix ends up taking the ABC’s scripted shows to the world, while providing a valuable second chance locally. It means you can rediscover this coruscating 2020 drama about Australia’s refugee detention regime, with co-creator Cate Blanchett in a supporting role. The multiple storylines deliver startling detail and unadorned empathy.</p> <p><strong>Stranger Things</strong></p> <p>Netflix’s biggest shows – and few are bigger than this 1980s supernatural horror homage – have redefined what a successful global franchise can be. Strip-mining their favourite movies of the era, creators the Duffer Brothers created a popcorn panopticon that’s become a streaming event even as recent seasons took their time getting up to speed.</p> <p><strong>Unbelievable</strong></p> <p>Here are your truest detectives. Based on real-life events, Toni Collette and Merritt Wever are riveting as Colorado police officers who partner up to catch a serial rapist. Their relentless search is an exceptional procedural, but it’s elevated by the heart-rending parallel story of a survivor (Kaitlyn Dever) trying to endure a system meant to help her.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>'}},\n",

Accurate, but criminally inadequate.\\n “Sly”, to use the nickname bestowed on him by a cop after Sylvester Stallone, is a columnist for The Age. He’s also a reporter, commentator, author, broadcaster, podcaster, expert witness, speaker, raconteur and humourist. His weekly Naked City articles, which you’ll find on Naked City articles at lunchtime Friday and in the newspaper on Saturday, are among the most compelling pieces of journalism you will read each week and provide a window into a part of society that most of us studiously avoid, but are endlessly fascinated by. His weekly appearances on 3AW as Sly of the Underworld are usually entertaining, occasionally poignant and always informative.\\n No one has a finer record of covering crime, corruption and policing in this state than Silvester, who began on the beat in Melbourne in 1979.\\n In the past 44 years he has seen and written about disturbing tragedies that have left scars on Melbourne, such as the Russell Street bombing, Russell Street bombing and the Russell Street bombing. Long after most reporters have closed their files, Sly is still writing about those incidents, and the people whose lives they changed, as they continue to reverberate through Melbourne.\\n He has had plenty of run-ins with crooks such as the terrifying “Badness”, who renamed him “Slime of the Underworld” and heckled him in various letters. He has received morbid Christmas cards from – and written books with – the late Mark “Chopper” Read.\\n During 44 years of reporting on Melbourne’s underbelly, Silvester has not lost a milligram of sensitivity, wit or ability. All three of those traits are on display in this week’s column, published earlier today, in which he looks at the latest on the Gippsland mushroom mystery, without losing sight of the fact three people beloved by their community have died in tragic circumstances.\\n Even though he’s apparently just “a columnist,” Silvester’s reporting instincts kicked in this week, as they often do. In tandem with Marta Pascual Juanola, our reporter on the ground, he has been chasing leads on this tragedy while police attempt to piece together exactly what happened.\\n A Graham Perkin Journalist of the Year alumnus, Silvester has won more journalism awards than you could poke a concealed weapon at. He has written numerous books, his Naked City podcast is a must-listen series and plans for a new weekly Naked City newsletter are in the works. He has provided evidence at royal commissions and has more cops and robbers in his contact book than a prison warden. \\n But I have a few contacts of my own. And these sources have told me that the 30th anniversary of John Silvester’s arrival at The Age is fast approaching. He joined on August 24, 1993.\\n Three decades of such excellent reporting for The Age requires acknowledgement and thanks, which I readily offer. It should also prompt a moment of reflection as to the importance of this kind of public interest journalism.\\n The Age has a long history of impeccable reporting on crime and justice, of which you as our backers and supporters should be proud. Our reporting has led to the prosecution of countless criminals and undoubtedly made our state safer. Our reporting on the justice, policing and corrections systems performs the essential public interest function of holding those in power to account and upholds the principle of open justice.\\n Your subscription funds what is quite possibly the most effective crime and justice team in the history of this publication. Beyond Silvester, we have accomplished investigative reporters such as Chris Vedelago and Chris Vedelago, whose consistently fearless reporting is evidence of their unrivalled professionalism. Chris Vedelago doesn’t miss a beat in Melbourne’s courts, while Juanola and Chris Vedelago are constantly talking to police and victims of crime out in the community. Under the direction of our news director Katie Bice, and supported by their colleagues, this team is doing a mighty job on your behalf.\\n Being a crime reporter is tough. Upsetting people is an occupational hazard, tolerance for missteps is low and a strong moral compass is a must. On all these measures, The Age’s subscribers are in very good hands.\\n Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a biography to update.\\n Patrick Elligett sends an exclusive newsletter to subscribers each week.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'I first met Sam Altman in the summer of 2019, days after Microsoft agreed to invest $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) in his three-year-old startup, OpenAI. At his suggestion, we had dinner at a small, decidedly modern restaurant not far from his home in San Francisco.\\n Halfway through the meal, he held up his iPhone so I could see the contract he had spent the past several months negotiating with one of the world’s largest tech companies. It said Microsoft’s billion-dollar investment would help OpenAI build what was called artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a machine that could do anything the human brain could do.\\n Later, as Altman sipped a sweet wine in lieu of dessert, he compared his company to the Manhattan Project. As if he were chatting about tomorrow’s weather forecast, he said the US effort to build an atomic bomb during World War II had been a “project on the scale of OpenAI — the level of ambition we aspire to.”\\n He believed AGI would bring the world prosperity and wealth like no one had ever seen. He also worried that the technologies his company was building could cause serious harm — spreading disinformation, undercutting the job market. Or even destroying the world as we know it.\\n “I try to be upfront,” he said. “Am I doing something good? Or really bad?”\\n In 2019, this sounded like science fiction.\\n In 2023, people are beginning to wonder if Altman was more prescient than they realised.\\n Now that OpenAI has released an online chatbot called ChatGPT, anyone with an internet connection is a click away from technology that will answer burning questions about organic chemistry, write a 2000-word term paper on Marcel Proust and his madeleine, or even generate a computer program that drops digital snowflakes across a laptop screen — all with a skill that seems human.\\n As people realise that this technology is also a way of spreading falsehoods or even persuading people to do things they should not do, some critics are accusing Altman of reckless behaviour.\\n This past week, more than a thousand AI experts and tech leaders called on OpenAI and other companies to pause their work on systems such as ChatGPT, saying they present “profound risks to society and humanity.”\\n And yet, when people act as if Altman has nearly realised his long-held vision, he pushes back.\\n “The hype over these systems — even if everything we hope for is right long term — is totally out of control for the short term,” he told me on a recent afternoon. There is time, he said, to better understand how these systems will ultimately change the world.\\n Many industry leaders, AI researchers and pundits see ChatGPT as a fundamental technological shift, as significant as the creation of the web browser or the iPhone. But few can agree on the future of this technology.\\n Some believe it will deliver a utopia where everyone has all the time and money ever needed. Others believe it could destroy humanity. Still, others spend much of their time arguing that the technology is never as powerful as everyone says it is, insisting that neither nirvana nor doomsday is as close as it might seem.\\n Altman, a slim, boyish-looking, 37-year-old entrepreneur and investor from the suburbs of St Louis, sits calmly in the middle of it all. As chief executive officer of OpenAI, he somehow embodies each of these seemingly contradictory views, hoping to balance the myriad possibilities as he moves this strange, powerful, flawed technology into the future.\\n That means he is often criticised from all directions. But those closest to him believe this is as it should be. “If you’re equally upsetting both extreme sides, then you’re doing something right,” said OpenAI’s president, Greg Brockman.\\n To spend time with Altman is to understand that Silicon Valley will push this technology forward even though it is not quite sure what the implications will be. At one point during our dinner in 2019, he paraphrased Robert Oppenheimer, leader of the Manhattan Project, who believed the atomic bomb was an inevitability of scientific progress. “Technology happens because it is possible,” he said. (Altman pointed out that, as fate would have it, he and Oppenheimer share a birthday.)\\n The vegetarian cattle farmer The warning, sent with the driving directions, was “Watch out for cows.”\\n Altman’s weekend home is a ranch in Napa, California, where farmhands grow wine grapes and raise cattle.\\n During the week, Altman and his partner, Oliver Mulherin, an Australian software engineer, share a house on Russian Hill in the heart of San Francisco. But as Friday arrives, they move to the ranch, a quiet spot among the rocky, grass-covered hills. Their 25-year-old house is remodelled to look both folksy and contemporary. The Cor-Ten steel that covers the outside walls is rusted to perfection.\\n As you approach the property, the cows roam across both the green fields and gravel roads.\\n Altman is a man who lives with contradictions, even at his getaway home: a vegetarian who raises beef cattle. He says his partner likes them.\\n On a recent afternoon walk at the ranch, we stopped to rest at the edge of a small lake. Looking out over the water, we discussed, once again, the future of AI.\\n His message had not changed much since 2019. But his words were even bolder.\\n He said his company was building technology that would “solve some of our most pressing problems, really increase the standard of life and also figure out much better uses for human will and creativity.”\\n He is very much a product of the Silicon Valley that grew so swiftly and so gleefully in the mid-2010s. As president of Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley startup accelerator and seed investor, from 2014-19, he advised an endless stream of new companies — and was shrewd enough to personally invest in several that became household names, including Airbnb, Reddit and Stripe. He takes pride in recognising when a technology is about to reach exponential growth — and then riding that curve into the future.\\n His longtime mentor, Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, explained Altman’s motivation like this: “Why is he working on something that won’t make him richer? One answer is that lots of people do that once they have enough money, which Sam probably does. The other is that he likes power.”\\n ‘What Bill Gates must have been like’ In the late 1990s, the John Burroughs School, a private prep school named for the 19th-century American naturalist and philosopher, invited an independent consultant to observe and critique daily life on its campus in the suburbs of St Louis.\\n The consultant’s review included one significant criticism: The student body was rife with homophobia.\\n In the early 2000s, Altman, a 17-year-old student at John Burroughs, set out to change the school’s culture, individually persuading teachers to post “Safe Space” signs on their classroom doors as a statement in support of gay students such as him. He came out during his senior year and said the St Louis of his teenage years was not an easy place to be gay.\\n Georgeann Kepchar, who taught the school’s Advanced Placement computer science course, saw Altman as one of her most talented computer science students — and one with a rare knack for pushing people in new directions.\\n “He had creativity and vision, combined with the ambition and force of personality to convince others to work with him on putting his ideas into action,” she said. Altman also told me that he had asked one particularly homophobic teacher to post a “Safe Space” sign just to troll the guy.\\n Graham, who worked alongside Altman for a decade, saw the same persuasiveness in the man from St Louis.\\n “He has a natural ability to talk people into things,” Graham said. “If it isn’t inborn, it was at least fully developed before he was 20. I first met Sam when he was 19, and I remember thinking at the time: ‘So this is what Bill Gates must have been like.‘”\\n Altman is not a coder or an engineer or an AI researcher. He is the person who sets the agenda, puts the teams together and strikes the deals. As the president of Y Combinator, he expanded the firm with near abandon, starting a new investment fund and a new research lab and stretching the number of companies advised by the firm into the hundreds each year.\\n He also began working on several projects outside the investment firm, including OpenAI, which he founded as a non-profit in 2015 alongside a group that included Elon Musk. By Altman’s own admission, Y Combinator grew increasingly concerned he was spreading himself too thin.\\n He resolved to refocus his attention on a project that would, as he put it, have a real impact on the world. He considered politics, but settled on AI.\\n Altman believed, according to his younger brother Max, that he was one of the few people who could meaningfully change the world through AI research, as opposed to the many people who could do so through politics.\\n In 2019, just as OpenAI’s research was taking off, Altman grabbed the reins, stepping down as president of Y Combinator to concentrate on a company with fewer than 100 employees that was unsure how it would pay its bills.\\n Within a year, he had transformed OpenAI into a non-profit with a for-profit arm. That way, he could pursue the money it would need to build a machine that could do anything the human brain could do.\\n The man in the middle In March, Altman tweeted out a selfie, bathed by a pale-orange flash, that showed him smiling between a blond woman giving a peace sign and a bearded guy wearing a fedora.\\n The woman was Canadian singer Grimes, Musk’s former partner, and the hat guy was Eliezer Yudkowsky, a self-described AI researcher who believes, perhaps more than anyone, that AI could one day destroy humanity.\\n The selfie — snapped by Altman at a party his company was hosting — shows how close he is to this way of thinking. But he has his own views on the dangers of AI.\\n Yudkowsky and his writings played key roles in the creation of both OpenAI and DeepMind, another lab intent on building artificial general intelligence.\\n He also helped spawn the vast online community of rationalists and effective altruists who are convinced that AI is an existential risk. This surprisingly influential group is represented by researchers inside many of the top AI labs, including OpenAI. They don’t see this as hypocrisy: Many of them believe that because they understand the dangers clearer than anyone else, they are in the best position to build this technology.\\n Altman argues that rather than developing and testing the technology entirely behind closed doors before releasing it in full, it is safer to gradually share it so everyone can better understand risks and how to handle them.\\n He told me that it would be a “very slow takeoff.”\\n When I asked Altman if a machine that could do anything the human brain could do would eventually drive the price of human labour to zero, he demurred. He said he could not imagine a world where human intelligence was useless.\\n If he’s wrong, he thinks he can make it up to humanity.\\n He rebuilt OpenAI as what he called a capped-profit company. This allowed him to pursue billions of dollars in financing by promising a profit to investors such as Microsoft. But these profits are capped, and any additional revenue will be pumped back into the OpenAI non-profit that was founded back in 2015.\\n His grand idea is that OpenAI will capture much of the world’s wealth through the creation of AGI and then redistribute this wealth to the people. In Napa, as we sat chatting beside the lake at the heart of his ranch, he tossed out several figures — $US100 billion, $US1 trillion, $US100 trillion.\\n If AGI does create all that wealth, he is not sure how the company will redistribute it. Money could mean something very different in this new world.\\n But as he once told me: “I feel like the AGI can help with that.”\\n This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\\n The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

At his suggestion, we had dinner at a small, decidedly modern restaurant not far from his home in San Francisco.</p> <p>Halfway through the meal, he held up his iPhone so I could see the contract he had spent the past several months negotiating with one of the world’s largest tech companies. It said Microsoft’s billion-dollar investment would help OpenAI build what was called artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a machine that could do anything the human brain could do.</p> <p>Later, as Altman sipped a sweet wine in lieu of dessert, he compared his company to the Manhattan Project. As if he were chatting about tomorrow’s weather forecast, he said the US effort to build an atomic bomb during World War II had been a “project on the scale of OpenAI — the level of ambition we aspire to.”</p> <p>He believed AGI would bring the world prosperity and wealth like no one had ever seen. He also worried that the technologies his company was building could cause serious harm — spreading disinformation, undercutting the job market. Or even destroying the world as we know it.</p> <p>“I try to be upfront,” he said. “Am I doing something good? Or really bad?”</p> <p>In 2019, this sounded like science fiction.</p> <p>In 2023, people are beginning to wonder if Altman was more prescient than they realised.</p> <p>Now that OpenAI has released an online chatbot called ChatGPT, anyone with an internet connection is a click away from technology that will answer burning questions about organic chemistry, write a 2000-word term paper on Marcel Proust and his madeleine, or even generate a computer program that drops digital snowflakes across a laptop screen — all with a skill that seems human.</p> <p>As people realise that this technology is also a way of spreading falsehoods or even persuading people to do things they should not do, some critics are accusing Altman of reckless behaviour.</p> <p>This past week, more than a thousand AI experts and tech leaders called on OpenAI and other companies to pause their work on systems such as ChatGPT, saying they present “profound risks to society and humanity.”</p> <p>And yet, when people act as if Altman has nearly realised his long-held vision, he pushes back.</p> <p>“The hype over these systems — even if everything we hope for is right long term — is totally out of control for the short term,” he told me on a recent afternoon. There is time, he said, to better understand how these systems will ultimately change the world.</p> <p>Many industry leaders, AI researchers and pundits see ChatGPT as a fundamental technological shift, as significant as the creation of the web browser or the iPhone. But few can agree on the future of this technology.</p> <p>Some believe it will deliver a utopia where everyone has all the time and money ever needed. Others believe it could destroy humanity. Still, others spend much of their time arguing that the technology is never as powerful as everyone says it is, insisting that neither nirvana nor doomsday is as close as it might seem.</p> <p>Altman, a slim, boyish-looking, 37-year-old entrepreneur and investor from the suburbs of St Louis, sits calmly in the middle of it all. As chief executive officer of OpenAI, he somehow embodies each of these seemingly contradictory views, hoping to balance the myriad possibilities as he moves this strange, powerful, flawed technology into the future.</p> <p>That means he is often criticised from all directions. But those closest to him believe this is as it should be. “If you’re equally upsetting both extreme sides, then you’re doing something right,” said OpenAI’s president, Greg Brockman.</p> <p>To spend time with Altman is to understand that Silicon Valley will push this technology forward even though it is not quite sure what the implications will be. At one point during our dinner in 2019, he paraphrased Robert Oppenheimer, leader of the Manhattan Project, who believed the atomic bomb was an inevitability of scientific progress. “Technology happens because it is possible,” he said. (Altman pointed out that, as fate would have it, he and Oppenheimer share a birthday.)</p> <h3>The vegetarian cattle farmer</h3> <p>The warning, sent with the driving directions, was “Watch out for cows.”</p> <p>Altman’s weekend home is a ranch in Napa, California, where farmhands grow wine grapes and raise cattle.</p> <p>During the week, Altman and his partner, Oliver Mulherin, an Australian software engineer, share a house on Russian Hill in the heart of San Francisco. But as Friday arrives, they move to the ranch, a quiet spot among the rocky, grass-covered hills. Their 25-year-old house is remodelled to look both folksy and contemporary. The Cor-Ten steel that covers the outside walls is rusted to perfection.</p> <p>As you approach the property, the cows roam across both the green fields and gravel roads.</p> <p>Altman is a man who lives with contradictions, even at his getaway home: a vegetarian who raises beef cattle. He says his partner likes them.</p> <p>On a recent afternoon walk at the ranch, we stopped to rest at the edge of a small lake. Looking out over the water, we discussed, once again, the future of AI.</p> <p>His message had not changed much since 2019. But his words were even bolder.</p> <p>He said his company was building technology that would “solve some of our most pressing problems, really increase the standard of life and also figure out much better uses for human will and creativity.”</p> <p>He is very much a product of the Silicon Valley that grew so swiftly and so gleefully in the mid-2010s. As president of Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley startup accelerator and seed investor, from 2014-19, he advised an endless stream of new companies — and was shrewd enough to personally invest in several that became household names, including Airbnb, Reddit and Stripe. He takes pride in recognising when a technology is about to reach exponential growth — and then riding that curve into the future.</p> <p>His longtime mentor, Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, explained Altman’s motivation like this: “Why is he working on something that won’t make him richer? One answer is that lots of people do that once they have enough money, which Sam probably does. The other is that he likes power.”</p> <h3>‘What Bill Gates must have been like’</h3> <p>In the late 1990s, the John Burroughs School, a private prep school named for the 19th-century American naturalist and philosopher, invited an independent consultant to observe and critique daily life on its campus in the suburbs of St Louis.</p> <p>The consultant’s review included one significant criticism: The student body was rife with homophobia.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, Altman, a 17-year-old student at John Burroughs, set out to change the school’s culture, individually persuading teachers to post “Safe Space” signs on their classroom doors as a statement in support of gay students such as him. He came out during his senior year and said the St Louis of his teenage years was not an easy place to be gay.</p> <p>Georgeann Kepchar, who taught the school’s Advanced Placement computer science course, saw Altman as one of her most talented computer science students — and one with a rare knack for pushing people in new directions.</p> <p>“He had creativity and vision, combined with the ambition and force of personality to convince others to work with him on putting his ideas into action,” she said. Altman also told me that he had asked one particularly homophobic teacher to post a “Safe Space” sign just to troll the guy.</p> <p>Graham, who worked alongside Altman for a decade, saw the same persuasiveness in the man from St Louis.</p> <p>“He has a natural ability to talk people into things,” Graham said. “If it isn’t inborn, it was at least fully developed before he was 20. I first met Sam when he was 19, and I remember thinking at the time: ‘So this is what Bill Gates must have been like.‘”</p> <p>Altman is not a coder or an engineer or an AI researcher. He is the person who sets the agenda, puts the teams together and strikes the deals. As the president of Y Combinator, he expanded the firm with near abandon, starting a new investment fund and a new research lab and stretching the number of companies advised by the firm into the hundreds each year.</p> <p>He also began working on several projects outside the investment firm, including OpenAI, which he founded as a non-profit in 2015 alongside a group that included Elon Musk. By Altman’s own admission, Y Combinator grew increasingly concerned he was spreading himself too thin.</p> <p>He resolved to refocus his attention on a project that would, as he put it, have a real impact on the world. He considered politics, but settled on AI.</p> <p>Altman believed, according to his younger brother Max, that he was one of the few people who could meaningfully change the world through AI research, as opposed to the many people who could do so through politics.</p> <p>In 2019, just as OpenAI’s research was taking off, Altman grabbed the reins, stepping down as president of Y Combinator to concentrate on a company with fewer than 100 employees that was unsure how it would pay its bills.</p> <p>Within a year, he had transformed OpenAI into a non-profit with a for-profit arm. That way, he could pursue the money it would need to build a machine that could do anything the human brain could do.</p> <h3>The man in the middle</h3> <p>In March, Altman tweeted out a selfie, bathed by a pale-orange flash, that showed him smiling between a blond woman giving a peace sign and a bearded guy wearing a fedora.</p> <p>The woman was Canadian singer Grimes, Musk’s former partner, and the hat guy was Eliezer Yudkowsky, a self-described AI researcher who believes, perhaps more than anyone, that AI could one day destroy humanity.</p> <p>The selfie — snapped by Altman at a party his company was hosting — shows how close he is to this way of thinking. But he has his own views on the dangers of AI.</p> <p>Yudkowsky and his writings played key roles in the creation of both OpenAI and DeepMind, another lab intent on building artificial general intelligence.</p> <p>He also helped spawn the vast online community of rationalists and effective altruists who are convinced that AI is an existential risk. This surprisingly influential group is represented by researchers inside many of the top AI labs, including OpenAI. They don’t see this as hypocrisy: Many of them believe that because they understand the dangers clearer than anyone else, they are in the best position to build this technology.</p> <p>Altman argues that rather than developing and testing the technology entirely behind closed doors before releasing it in full, it is safer to gradually share it so everyone can better understand risks and how to handle them.</p> <p>He told me that it would be a “very slow takeoff.”</p> <p>When I asked Altman if a machine that could do anything the human brain could do would eventually drive the price of human labour to zero, he demurred. He said he could not imagine a world where human intelligence was useless.</p> <p>If he’s wrong, he thinks he can make it up to humanity.</p> <p>He rebuilt OpenAI as what he called a capped-profit company. This allowed him to pursue billions of dollars in financing by promising a profit to investors such as Microsoft. But these profits are capped, and any additional revenue will be pumped back into the OpenAI non-profit that was founded back in 2015.</p> <p>His grand idea is that OpenAI will capture much of the world’s wealth through the creation of AGI and then redistribute this wealth to the people. In Napa, as we sat chatting beside the lake at the heart of his ranch, he tossed out several figures — $US100 billion, $US1 trillion, $US100 trillion.</p> <p>If AGI does create all that wealth, he is not sure how the company will redistribute it. Money could mean something very different in this new world.</p> <p>But as he once told me: “I feel like the AGI can help with that.”</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p> <p><strong><i>The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion. </i><i>Sign up to get it every weekday morning</i><i>.</i></strong></p>'}},\n",

We let advertisers flog sugar to kids, an obscenity banned in similar countries. We have politicians who believe that representing regional Australia requires no more effort than wearing a wide-brimmed hat.\\n The distances, too, are ridiculous. Brisbane, possibly the best city in Australia, should be a bit closer to Sydney. That way, both populations could mingle more, without needing to fly. Just three hours closer and the drive would be doable, and we wouldn’t need to give money to those bastards at Qantas. This is also true when it comes to Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart and – certainly – Perth.\\n But back to the barbecues. The councils clean the barbecues, but most of the time that task is unnecessary.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'With its over-the-top histrionics and, well, Ryan Gosling in full ’80s power ballad mode, Andrew Wyatt had an inkling that I’m Just Ken, the absurd anthem he and Mark Ronson penned for Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, would have some viral power.\\n He’d been through it before, after all: first with Pop! Goes My Heart, his effervescent cult fave written for the 2007 romantic comedy, Music and Lyrics, starring Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, and then with Shallow, the Oscar-winning song he co-wrote for Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s A Star is Born in 2018.\\n “I did [Pop! Goes My Heart] years ago in the early days of YouTube and there were a lot of people, like thousands, making their own versions of that music video. So I thought that kind of thing might happen, especially because now TikTok has been so friendly to things that have a musical theatre feeling to them,” says Wyatt, over Zoom from his car in New York City traffic. “But, like being on the charts and stuff? That was stunning to me, actually.\\n “It’s like Meat Loaf or something,” he says. “I guess there’s a spot for that in people’s hearts and minds, for something a little bit campy that’s done with a sort of sincerity. It’s a nice combo.”\\n The song’s success outside the film’s very specific context (or Mojo Dojo Casa House) has been a fun surprise. On its debut, it reached No.5 on Billboard’s Hot Rock and Alternative chart, and it has since racked up more than 100 million global streams. Heading into awards season, it’s somehow up for a Grammy, a Golden Globe and just last week was shortlisted among 15 songs in the running for the Oscars’ Music (Original Song) category.\\n The prospect of Gosling on the Oscars stage, belting out the smash in front of his Hollywood peers, perhaps even with the song’s featured stars (guitars from Slash and Eddie’s progeny Wolfgang Van Halen, and drums from Foo Fighters’ Josh Freese), already promises to be one of 2024’s early, ridiculous highlights. But Wyatt, recalling the wild run that was Shallow’s win, is not getting ahead of himself.\\n “Look, I think if we got to go, it would be a fun party. But I don’t know, I try not to think about that stuff in my life,” he says. Still, it begs the question: why is he so good at movie music?\\n Wyatt laughs. “I think there’s a certain feeling of, like, you’re off the hook, you know? When you’re writing for yourself, or being the singer, you have a lot of pressure on you, people or critics or whatever are going to say things about you.” He recalls his time as frontman of the Swedish indie landfill band Miike Snow, whose 2009 hit Animal can still conjure drunken singalongs for the average Millennial.\\n “When I was in Miike Snow, it was always like, ‘The critics, what are they going to say?’ Because you’re sticking your neck out and you’re being so vulnerable when it’s just you,” Wyatt says. “But when you’re doing it for a character in a film, especially if it’s a comedy, it’s a lot of fun because you can still use all your musical skills but the pressure is off it being your identity or, like, how are people going to judge you as an artist. There’s such a freedom to it.”\\n At 52, Wyatt’s a musical journeyman. As an 18-year-old, in a jazz program at Manhattan’s New School, he was in a band with super-producer Greg Kurstin (Adele) and Michael Tighe and Parker Kindred, who later played in Jeff Buckley’s band (Wyatt also used to open for Buckley during his coffeehouse years). He’s recently teased a solo return. It would be his first album under his name since 2016’s iii (he released its first single Beyond the Pale in June).

       "      'value': {'string_value': '<p>With its over-the-top histrionics and, well, Ryan Gosling in full ’80s power ballad mode, Andrew Wyatt had an inkling that <em>I’m Just Ken, </em>the absurd anthem he and Mark Ronson penned for Greta Gerwig’s <em>Barbie, </em>would have some viral power.</p> <p>He’d been through it before, after all: first with <em>Pop! Goes My Heart</em>, his effervescent cult fave written for the 2007 romantic comedy, <em>Music and Lyrics</em>, starring Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, and then with <em>Shallow</em>, the Oscar-winning song he co-wrote for Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s <em>A Star is Born</em> in 2018.</p> <p>“I did [<em>Pop! Goes My Heart</em>] years ago in the early days of YouTube and there were a lot of people, like thousands, making their own versions of that music video. So I thought that kind of thing might happen, especially because now TikTok has been so friendly to things that have a musical theatre feeling to them,” says Wyatt, over Zoom from his car in New York City traffic. “But, like being on the charts and stuff? That was stunning to me, actually.</p> <p>“It’s like Meat Loaf or something,” he says. “I guess there’s a spot for that in people’s hearts and minds, for something a little bit campy that’s done with a sort of sincerity. It’s a nice combo.”</p> <p>The song’s success outside the film’s very specific context (or Mojo Dojo Casa House) has been a fun surprise. On its debut, it reached No.5 on Billboard’s Hot Rock and Alternative chart, and it has since racked up more than 100 million global streams. Heading into awards season, it’s somehow up for a Grammy, a Golden Globe and just last week was shortlisted among 15 songs in the running for the Oscars’ Music (Original Song) category.</p> <p>The prospect of Gosling on the Oscars stage, belting out the smash in front of his Hollywood peers, perhaps even with the song’s featured stars (guitars from Slash and Eddie’s progeny Wolfgang Van Halen, and drums from Foo Fighters’ Josh Freese), already promises to be one of 2024’s early, ridiculous highlights. But Wyatt, recalling the wild run that was <em>Shallow</em>’s win, is not getting ahead of himself.</p> <p>“Look, I think if we got to go, it would be a fun party. But I don’t know, I try not to think about that stuff in my life,” he says. Still, it begs the question: why is he so good at movie music?</p> <p>Wyatt laughs. “I think there’s a certain feeling of, like, you’re off the hook, you know? When you’re writing for yourself, or being the singer, you have a lot of pressure on you, people or critics or whatever are going to say things about you.” He recalls his time as frontman of the Swedish indie landfill band Miike Snow, whose 2009 hit <em>Animal</em> can still conjure drunken singalongs for the average Millennial.</p> <p>“When I was in Miike Snow, it was always like, ‘The critics, what are they going to say?’ Because you’re sticking your neck out and you’re being so vulnerable when it’s just you,” Wyatt says. “But when you’re doing it for a character in a film, especially if it’s a comedy, it’s a lot of fun because you can still use all your musical skills but the pressure is off it being your identity or, like, how are people going to judge you as an artist. There’s such a freedom to it.”</p> <p>At 52, Wyatt’s a musical journeyman. As an 18-year-old, in a jazz program at Manhattan’s New School, he was in a band with super-producer Greg Kurstin (Adele) and Michael Tighe and Parker Kindred, who later played in Jeff Buckley’s band (Wyatt also used to open for Buckley during his coffeehouse years). He’s recently teased a solo return. It would be his first album under his name since 2016’s <em>iii</em> (he released its first single <em>Beyond the Pale</em> in June).

Upon repeated viewings, conducted over years or even decades, there are paintings that retain their freshness, renewing themselves in front of one’s eyes. As it has been only six years since a survey of Elisabeth Cummings’s work at the S.H. Ervin Gallery, one might assume it was too early for another viewing, but the exhibition at the National Art School Gallery decisively refutes this suggestion.\\n Elisabeth Cummings: Radiance is one of those rare, truly irresistible displays that reminds us of the fundamental reason we look at paintings: because it is a pleasure, not a chore. There are many shows I attend out of sense of duty, with no expectation of personally liking the work, even if it demands a favourable review. In this case, the best paintings are so “sticky” that as soon as I’d left a room, I felt like going back for a second look.\\n I’ve written so much about Cummings over the years that I hesitate to trawl back over the story of her career. Suffice to say she was a slow starter who gathered momentum in her 60s and would produce her most important paintings in the decades that followed. It’s not coincidental that her work took off after a 1990 move to Wedderburn, on the outskirts of Sydney. Happily settled in a mud-brick cottage, among a small community of artists, Cummings fell into that zone of perfect concentration that has allowed her to spend months refining a painting. Subject matter was to be found at her front door, although she has often preferred to travel to another part of Australia, or the world, bringing back impressions to be reworked in the studio.\\n One of the main reasons Cunmings was slow to be noticed is her inherent modesty – not a condition that afflicts many artists. Always feeling she had more to learn, she has quietly outstripped those who think they know it all as her dedication and self-criticism began to produce canvases that could hold their own in any company. From being a marginal, almost invisible presence in the Australian art world, Cummings has risen to a level that should make her an obligatory acquisition for the major public art museums.\\n While one can only applaud the NAS Gallery for this show, it’s also an implicit indictment of the Art Gallery of NSW, who have consistently ignored the claims of Sydney’s best-known artists. Cummings is 89 this year and will probably never be honoured by the state gallery within her lifetime – making her a member of a depressingly large club.\\n If Cummings deserves more attention, it’s not only because of the quality of her work, it’s because she is extremely popular. This show has enjoyed booming attendances, while an excellent catalogue may soon need to be reprinted. Among Sydney artists she is a rock star, with hardcore fans and dozens of emulators.\\n Radiance concentrates on the work of the past 30 years, when Cummings really began to find her feet. In her earlier pictures her admiration for artists such as Bonnard and Vuillard could be easily detected, and traces still linger in her later paintings. Picasso famously despised Bonnard for his “indecision”, but this is precisely the quality Cummings seems to adore. In a classic Bonnard painting, forms and colours appear provisional, with edges blurred. Shadows are patches of colour, subjects suspended somewhere between reverie and reality.\\n We see these same tendencies in a painting such as The Music Room (1996), in which Cummings creates a heavily abstracted image of a crowded chamber lit by the glare from a single window. The interior is dark and intimate, but outside the sun is shining ferociously. It suggests that music is a world within a world, an interiorised experience that requires a certain distance, as one sense is privileged over the others. In the rhythms of the brushstrokes, we find analogies for the rhythms of a musical composition.\\n There are a series of pictures in this show in which this dialogue between inner and outer worlds is echoed, with a door or window providing the connection. It’s a device found in many of Matisse’s works. With Cummings, the most dramatic and vibrant example may be The shearer’s kitchen, Mt. Murchison (2011), where a blaze of sunlight enters by a wide open portal to illuminate a heavily laden table. In the corner, two dogs watch at a respectful distance.\\n In the years that separate The Music Room from The shearers’ kitchen, Cummings’ palette becomes lighter and brighter. Landscapes such as After the fires, Wedderburn (1994) or Bird in the bush (1995) are painted in shades of grey, brown, black and a murky yellow ochre. They are tremendously suggestive of the colours of the bush ravaged by fire, and dappled light filtered through the leaves of the gum trees.\\n On the way there are paintings such as Dry riverbed and rock forms (1994), where the pink-grey tonality and patchwork brushstrokes recall mid-career Philip Guston. It’s possibly the most singular picture in the show – the kind of work art historians call “transitionary”.\\n By 2000 she was painting The river, a two-metre-long vista in which we feel the powerful horizontal movement of a waterbed bathed in sunlight. The greys and dull ochres are still present, but now suffused with the radiance that gives this exhibition its completely appropriate title.\\n It’s this brightness that dominates the exhibition, giving Cummings’ late work an electric charge in paintings such as After the wet, Elcho Island (2004), Edge of the Simpson Desert (2011), or White Billabong (2002). We accept these canvases as landscapes, but it is their abstract qualities that hold our attention. The paintings have been put together layer upon layer, with frequent corrections and rethinkings; areas have been painted out or scratched back in; busy, calligraphic marks and lazy, looping brushstrokes create a sense of constant movement. The eye is never allowed to rest, being hustled from one part of the painting to the next, as if there is so much to see one can’t afford to linger too long in any one place. If Bonnard is the presiding spirit in the early work, the later pictures feel more indebted to the churning, restless energy of Willem de Kooning.\\n Cummings’ excitement in these paintings is almost palpable. We feel her absorption in the work, and the pleasure it affords her, as she thinks back over the details of a landscape she is recreating in the studio. The paintings are visual diaries of impressions and sensations, stored away in the back of the artist’s mind, to be reactivated in the present. One thought, one gesture, leads to another. Cummings is not simply painting what she saw but what she felt, and this can only be done in the language of abstraction. It’s her achievement to take this language, often thought of as difficult or obscure, and create paintings with such an immediate, almost visceral appeal. If happiness could be stored in a jar and spread on a canvas, this is the way it might look.\\n Elisabeth Cummings: Radiance is at the National Art School Gallery until October 21.\\n To read more from Spectrum, visit our page here.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'Spowers & Syme may sound like a firm of accountants, but we’re dealing with an entirely different order of creativity. Ethel Spowers (1890-1947), and Eveline Syme (1888-1961), were groundbreaking Australian artists at a time when women found it difficult to make any impression on an art scene dominated by self-confident and self-serving males.\\n A touring exhibition put together by the National Gallery of Australia, Spowers & Syme is showing at the S.H. Ervin Gallery on the fourth stage of a lengthy journey, before winding up in Brisbane later this year. As the display is mostly works on paper, the exhibited items will go into extended storage when the tour concludes, so it’s worth catching the show while you can.\\n When a survey from late 2019 revealed that women were now ahead of men in most categories of artistic representation in Australia, the one blemish was in the number of works exhibited in public collections, which is a function of history, not institutional will.\\n It’s a useful exercise to seek out works by neglected female artists but museums need to judge dispassionately in terms of what they collect and exhibit. When a gallery commits to a 50-50 representation, as both the NGA and the Art Gallery of NSW have done, this is a simple matter in the contemporary field (where women are in the ascendancy) but becomes progressively more difficult as we move back in time as there aren’t enough female artists to fill the quotas. It’s not a function of present-day chauvinism, but of past chauvinism which we are powerless to change.\\n This provides an extra incentive to dilute the historical display with all sorts of contemporary items, in the name of gender balance or righting the wrongs of colonialism. Such hangs may be fun for a while, but they eventually become tedious and confusing. Overall, a survey of two significant female artists, such as Spowers and Syme, or a retrospective of Cressida Campbell, are much better ways of demonstrating a commitment to women artists – if that’s a priority. They also meet the more important criteria of being shows of historical interest and quality.\\n In the catalogue for Spowers & Syme, curator Sarina Noordhuis-Fairfax discusses the context in which the artists worked and the special circumstances that enabled them to pursue their vocations. The two friends came from wealthy newspaper families. Ethel’s father, William Spowers, was the owner of the Argus and the Australasian; Eveline’s father, Joseph Syme, was a partner in rival daily, The Age. Both women lived in mansions, Ethel in Toorak, Eveline in St. Kilda. They had the economic support of their families and were given excellent educations – Eveline excelled in classics at Cambridge.\\n Few women enjoyed the advantages of Spowers and Syme. In an era when most women settled for being housewives and mothers, they were able to travel and study in Paris and London, pursuing careers as artists. Neither woman ever married, which need not be taken as a statement of sexual preferences, but rather as a determination to retain their freedom.\\n They were involved with many like-minded peers in a range of clubs and societies which demanded equal opportunities for women and discussed intellectual, political and artistic topics. The chief difficulty was that they were working in an artistic milieu controlled by patricians such as J.S. MacDonald and Lionel Lindsay. For these gentlemen, the standard of excellence came from artists such as Arthur Streeton and Hans Heysen (both of whom would be knighted).\\n Women artists were often dismissed as hobbyists, while all forms of modernism were rejected in favour of a pastoral dream of the bush and a tradition of figure painting that had barely evolved since Rembrandt’s day. The arrogance and insularity of the self-appointed guardians of national culture seems inconceivable today, but at the time there were relatively few people in Australia who had any knowledge of modern art.\\n It was logical that bright, independent women such as Spowers and Syme would gravitate to the modernist camp. Not only was the alternative stuffy and unattractive, there was a genuine excitement about the new work emerging from Paris and London. Allowing for a few smaller travelling exhibitions, it would take until 1939, when Keith Murdoch sponsored a landmark show of British and French art, for the public to show interest in modernist innovation.\\n Spowers and Syme would study with the celebrated printmaker Claude Flight at the Grosvenor School in London, learning the techniques of coloured linocutting, with which they would produce their most memorable works. They also imbibed the modernist gospel, which looked to the mechanical age for inspiration, with compositions characterised by dynamic, geometric forms.\\n For Spowers, works such as The plough. (1928), with its complex pattern of birds in flight, and Wet Afternoon (1930), all massed umbrellas and driving rain, are masterpieces of an underrated genre. Her print of a coal mine, The works, Yallourn (1933), is one of the great images of industry in Australian art.

       "      'value': {'string_value': '<p>Spowers &amp; Syme may sound like a firm of accountants, but we’re dealing with an entirely different order of creativity. Ethel Spowers (1890-1947), and Eveline Syme (1888-1961), were groundbreaking Australian artists at a time when women found it difficult to make any impression on an art scene dominated by self-confident and self-serving males.</p> <p>A touring exhibition put together by the National Gallery of Australia, <em>Spowers &amp; Syme</em> is showing at the S.H. Ervin Gallery on the fourth stage of a lengthy journey, before winding up in Brisbane later this year. As the display is mostly works on paper, the exhibited items will go into extended storage when the tour concludes, so it’s worth catching the show while you can.</p> <p>When a survey from late 2019 revealed that women were now ahead of men in most categories of artistic representation in Australia, the one blemish was in the number of works exhibited in public collections, which is a function of history, not institutional will.</p> <p>It’s a useful exercise to seek out works by neglected female artists but museums need to judge dispassionately in terms of what they collect and exhibit. When a gallery commits to a 50-50 representation, as both the NGA and the Art Gallery of NSW have done, this is a simple matter in the contemporary field (where women are in the ascendancy) but becomes progressively more difficult as we move back in time as there aren’t enough female artists to fill the quotas. It’s not a function of present-day chauvinism, but of past chauvinism which we are powerless to change.</p> <p>This provides an extra incentive to dilute the historical display with all sorts of contemporary items, in the name of gender balance or righting the wrongs of colonialism. Such hangs may be fun for a while, but they eventually become tedious and confusing. Overall, a survey of two significant female artists, such as Spowers and Syme, or a retrospective of Cressida Campbell, are much better ways of demonstrating a commitment to women artists – if that’s a priority. They also meet the more important criteria of being shows of historical interest and quality.</p> <p>In the catalogue for <em>Spowers &amp; Syme</em>, curator Sarina Noordhuis-Fairfax discusses the context in which the artists worked and the special circumstances that enabled them to pursue their vocations. The two friends came from wealthy newspaper families. Ethel’s father, William Spowers, was the owner of the <em>Argus</em> and the <em>Australasian</em>; Eveline’s father, Joseph Syme, was a partner in rival daily, <em>The Age</em>. Both women lived in mansions, Ethel in Toorak, Eveline in St. Kilda. They had the economic support of their families and were given excellent educations – Eveline excelled in classics at Cambridge.</p> <p>Few women enjoyed the advantages of Spowers and Syme. In an era when most women settled for being housewives and mothers, they were able to travel and study in Paris and London, pursuing careers as artists. Neither woman ever married, which need not be taken as a statement of sexual preferences, but rather as a determination to retain their freedom.</p> <p>They were involved with many like-minded peers in a range of clubs and societies which demanded equal opportunities for women and discussed intellectual, political and artistic topics. The chief difficulty was that they were working in an artistic milieu controlled by patricians such as J.S. MacDonald and Lionel Lindsay. For these gentlemen, the standard of excellence came from artists such as Arthur Streeton and Hans Heysen (both of whom would be knighted).</p> <p>Women artists were often dismissed as hobbyists, while all forms of modernism were rejected in favour of a pastoral dream of the bush and a tradition of figure painting that had barely evolved since Rembrandt’s day. The arrogance and insularity of the self-appointed guardians of national culture seems inconceivable today, but at the time there were relatively few people in Australia who had any knowledge of modern art.</p> <p>It was logical that bright, independent women such as Spowers and Syme would gravitate to the modernist camp. Not only was the alternative stuffy and unattractive, there was a genuine excitement about the new work emerging from Paris and London. Allowing for a few smaller travelling exhibitions, it would take until 1939, when Keith Murdoch sponsored a landmark show of British and French art, for the public to show interest in modernist innovation.</p> <p>Spowers and Syme would study with the celebrated printmaker Claude Flight at the Grosvenor School in London, learning the techniques of coloured linocutting, with which they would produce their most memorable works. They also imbibed the modernist gospel, which looked to the mechanical age for inspiration, with compositions characterised by dynamic, geometric forms.</p> <p>For Spowers, works such as <em>The plough.</em> (1928), with its complex pattern of birds in flight, and <em>Wet Afternoon</em> (1930), all massed umbrellas and driving rain, are masterpieces of an underrated genre. Her print of a coal mine, <em>The works, Yallourn </em>(1933), is one of the great images of industry in Australian art. She makes the mine look as dynamic as a velodrome.</p> <p>Syme took the same ruthlessly geometric approach in her print <em>Skating</em> (1929) but would fall back on more conventional landscape motifs in later works, such as <em>Sydney tram line </em>(1936).</p> <p>One major difference is that Syme had gone on to study with Andre Lhote in Paris, at a time when cubism had become submerged in the “return to order” that swept through French art in the years between the wars. Lhote, a leading “salon cubist”, was one of the most influential teachers in Paris, whose ideas would make their way to Australia via students such as Syme, Dorrit Black, Grace Crowley, Anne Dangar and Edith Alsop.</p> <p>Spowers’ life was cut short by breast cancer, but her final years were spent writing and illustrating children’s books. Syme’s output would slow to a crawl, with Noordhuis-Fairfax noting that after her friend’s death she would produce only four more linocuts over 14 years.</p> <p>There’s a touch of melancholy about the relatively small amount of work we have by these two talented artists who took a more adventurous course during the 1930s than almost any of their male counterparts. They were trailblazers and intellectuals who influenced the course of modern art in Australia, but this compact exhibition doesn’t fill the gallery, even when supplemented with documents, photos, memorabilia, and prints by fellow travellers such as Dorrit Black, George Bell, Nutter Buzzacott, Lill Tschudi and Cyril E.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'Whoever decided to release Triangle of Sadness at Christmas time in Australia must have a sense of humour as wicked as that of the movie itself. Written and directed by the Swedish filmmaker Ruben Ostlund, Triangle is a bracing movie, but it isn’t your standard holiday fare. When it premiered at Cannes earlier this year, it won the Palme d’Or, and got an eight-minute standing ovation. It also prompted some audience walkouts, for reasons we’ll get to.\\n I knew I was going to love the film after an early scene set at a fashion parade. Before the event begins, an usher rudely evicts some audience members from the front row, even though their tickets prove they’re in the right place. Once these plebs have been removed, a party of ticketless fashion-world celebrities is fawningly escorted to the vacant seats. Then the models start strutting down the catwalk, in front of a big slogan proclaiming the event’s theme: We’re All Equal.\\n Triangle of Sadness is a rare beast: an aggressive and grown-up social satire, with a fully functioning brain and fangs. Clearly, Ostlund is fed up with the shallow, self-congratulatory world of Botox and Instagram, and he wants to give it a salutary kick up the arse. He’s got the kind of crankily irreverent sensibility you still occasionally encounter in literature, if you’re lucky, but almost never at the movies. At times his film assaults your senses, but it never insults your intelligence.\\n In the opening act, we meet a couple of young fashion models: Carl, played by the English actor Harris Dickinson, and Yaya, played by the South African actress Charlbi Dean, who died unexpectedly a few months after the film’s triumph at Cannes.\\n Carl and Yaya have used their good looks to build a sideline career as online influencers. In that capacity they’ve scored free tickets to go on a luxury cruise with various representatives of the global financial elite: a Russian fertiliser magnate, a Nordic app-coder, a couple of elderly British arms dealers. The only American on board is the ship’s drunken captain, played by Woody Harrelson.\\n After a day at sea, the guests assemble in the ship’s dining room for a swanky welcome-aboard meal. The weather turns rough, and Ostlund’s camera begins to lurch ominously from side to side. As swaying waiters bring out course after course of haute cuisine, the diners succumb to seasickness. An orgy of mass vomiting follows, which goes on for something like 15 minutes.\\n This is the part that prompted the walkouts at Cannes. You can see why. Until now, the Mr Creosote scene in Monty Python’s Meaning of Life has been the benchmark for over-the-top cinematic regurgitation. The stricken diners in Triangle of Sadness make Mr Creosote look like an underachiever. Nor is seasickness their only plight. Some food poisoning seems to be in the mix too, since seasickness alone would not produce the full range of gastric calamities that Ostlund outrageously depicts.\\n “Maybe I did go too far,” Ostlund has said of his chundering sequence. “But I wanted to.” That could be the mantra of any self-respecting satirist. Decent satire should go too far; it should use bad taste in a good cause. Ostlund wants to remind us that no matter how rich or good-looking we are, we’re all just mammals, and all subject to the same humiliating bodily laws. All good satire has a levelling effect, and nothing is more deflating to human self-regard than a serious gastric emergency.\\n There are subtler moments in Ostlund’s film, but the barfing sequence is the part that people will remember and talk about. The rest of the film merely engages your intellect. The barfing sequence makes you feel Ostlund’s moral disgust at a gut level. It uses gross-out humour to make a serious ethical point.\\n Here Ostlund is participating in a tradition that goes back at least as far as the 1500s, when Rabelais wrote his earthy epic Gargantua and Pantagruel. That novel recounted the bawdy exploits of a family of French giants, and it laid heavy stress on the body’s baser functions, including vomiting, which Rabelais called “skinning the fox”.\\n The Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin coined a great name for the literary mode that Rabelais more or less invented: he called it “grotesque realism”. The Rabelaisian approach caught on fast in English literature. Shakespeare was a Rabelais fan. The corpulent, wine-guzzling Falstaff is a palpably Rabelaisian figure. And when Iago talks about “making the beast with two backs”, he’s quoting from Gargantua and Pantagruel.\\n Jonathan Swift, the most famous satirist in our language, was a master of politically charged dunny humour. In Gulliver’s Travels (1726), Gulliver visits the island kingdom of Lilliput, where the locals are only six inches tall. When the royal palace catches fire, the Lilliputians fight the blaze with thimble-sized buckets of water. Fortunately Gulliver has a full bladder, so he whips out his privy member and hoses the palace with urine, “which I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper places, that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished”.\\n A few years after he wrote Gulliver’s Travels, Swift’s satirical imagination went to the other end of the human digestive tract. In his pamphlet A Modest Proposal, he floated the idea of easing the burden on Ireland’s poor by feeding their children to the rich.\\n Satire can be an ugly form, if the satirist is angry enough. Joseph Heller’s anti-war novel Catch-22 (1961) had the soldier in white – a maimed serviceman lying mutely in a hospital bed, encased in plaster from head to toe. A jar of fluid drains into him via a tube attached to his elbow; another jar near his groin collects his waste. When that jar is full and the other one empty, they are switched. The soldier in white is just a body, in the starkest possible sense. He’s a vessel for consuming and expelling fluids. He may not even be alive.\\n A few critics of Triangle of Sadness have suggested that the movie isn’t much chop, because it takes aim at barn-sized targets like Instagram and financial inequality. So what if Ostlund dislikes those things? these critics say. Who doesn’t? \\n But the best satirists have always taken aim at barn-sized targets. War. Religion. Human folly. It isn’t the size of the target that matters. It’s the inventiveness of the execution.\\n Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove (1964) is one of the greatest satirical movies ever made. The target of its ridicule was nuclear Armageddon – and who wasn’t against that? The most resonant scene in Kubrick’s film was the last one, where Slim Pickens rides the descending nuke as if it’s a bronco. It wasn’t the best-written or best-performed scene in Strangelove, but it was the moment that conveyed the film’s rage most eloquently.\\n Swift said that satire is a sort of mirror, “wherein beholders do generally discover everybody’s face but their own.” Clever satirists can get away with a lot. At the height of the Vietnam war, no Hollywood studio was going to bankroll a film that ridiculed that conflict directly. So Robert Altman made M*A*S*H (1970), which was set during the Korean War, but was plainly about the insanity in Vietnam.\\n Altman opposed that insanity by making his film as earthy as possible. Surgical scenes that set a new benchmark for on-screen gore were juxtaposed with shower-block pranks that broke new ground in the depiction of nudity. M*A*S*H was also the first American studio picture to feature the f-word. Admittedly, the shock value of that particular coup has worn off.\\n Not that satire always has to shock you. The White Lotus, the second series of which recently wrapped up on Binge and Foxtel, was billed as a satire. But Mike White, the show’s creator, is a very gentle kind of satirist. In Triangle of Sadness, Ostlund’s finger is always on the scales. Sometimes his whole fist is on there. White’s brand of satire is far more hands-off.\\n Like the first series, the second series of The White Lotus dealt with a bunch of American tourists behaving badly at a foreign luxury resort. The only central character to appear in both seasons was the insufferable Tanya McQuoid, played by Jennifer Coolidge.\\n Tanya is an American grotesque – hyper-rich, self-absorbed, and staggeringly uncultured. She’s so cartoonish a character that she sometimes seems to have strayed into the show from the nearby set of a far broader comedy. But really she serves as White’s satirical lynchpin. She’s his version of the barfing scene – the big gaudy effect at the show’s centre, whose impact allows him to make subtler points in the surrounding storylines.\\n On the whole, White’s Americans are so decadent and morally lost that they make you wonder if their culture is in terminal decline. But Mike White is part of that culture too, and as long as America can still produce entertainment as edgy and self-aware as The White Lotus, it would be premature to write the place off.\\n This is the paradoxical thing about satire. It tends to flourish at precisely the moment when everything else is going to pot. When a filmmaker spends 15 minutes showing people voiding the contents of their stomachs in all directions, it seems safe to say that his society is not in the best of health. The consolation is that satire may now be entering one of its golden periods.\\n In the early 1960s, the great English comic Peter Cook opened a satirical venue in London called the Establishment Club. The place was modelled, he said, on “those wonderful Berlin cabarets that did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the outbreak of the Second World War”.\\n In other words, even the best satirists can’t change the world. All they can do is show us how comically awful it is. If things are going to get any better, that’s up to the rest of us.\\n To read more from Spectrum, visit our page here.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'All Night Long, Caitlin Harnett and the Pony Boys If it’s somewhat of a shock to hear that country music is back in vogue, then it’s not too far of a stretch to anticipate that you may not have been paying attention to Sydney’s inner west the past few years. It’s not unusual these days to find predominantly youthful punters packed in a crowded pub, sporting white Akubras and nodding heads in unison to a heavily tattooed, outspoken woman named Caitlin Harnett.\\n Harnett and her backing band the Pony Boys command attention. A social media savvy output that matches their riotous onstage demeanour has helped solidify this unique Sydney band as a local stalwart – a group that not only made it cool again to yee-haw, but one that pays its respects to timeless Americana tinged with Harnett’s soulful, heart-rending vocals that croon of heartbreak, self-disillusionment and lingering grief.\\n All Night Long is somewhat of a sombre sophomore effort compared to 2020’s acclaimed Late Night Essentials – and this isn’t a bad thing. Behind Harnett’s tough-looking exterior, there’s a sensitive woman, and this time around she wants us to know that. I’ll Get By, Sidelines and Can’t Have It All speak of obvious frustration with an immature past love, the latter summing them up as “too big a mountain to climb”. Sure, ouch – but it’s rounded out almost instantly with an unforgettable sax melody that works incredibly well above the chorus-soaked guitars towards the last half of the track. It’s enough to make even the most regretful of the broken-hearted crack a nostalgic smile.\\n “Even cowgirls cry, sometimes,” Harnett sings on lead single Even Cowgirls Cry, a foray into self-awareness and a message of hope to those who choose to bottle up their feelings rather than express them. But even Harnett can acknowledge she’s guilty of that herself. Lil Ripper speaks of a “big black dog sitting by my side”, and she sings of pressure on herself and laments the loss of her creative spirit for a moment in time, only to find it again and then some; it’s just one of the record’s highlights aided by a captivating, semi-strummed arpeggiated lead guitar riff that absolutely excels in the track’s last half, with guitarist Sam Montague busting into a formidable solo that I’m pretty sure peeled the paint off the walls of the studio they recorded at.\\n It’s hard to believe Harnett has been wasting her time – a recurring theme on All Night Long – if you’re somewhat familiar with the Pony Boys’ engrossing touring schedule; something she doesn’t necessarily seem to have complaints over, but is introspective enough on Living with Yourself to know when her busy life as a musician has been messing with prioritising the most important thing, herself. She’s clearly not without faults, but a drive to succeed helps her cope: “My light’s still on and it’s burning”. It shows when we hit If I Don’t Have You, a slow-moving, sweet love ballad plucked straight out of the 1950s where Harnett’s marvellous vocal performance wouldn’t have sounded too out of place alongside the likes of Elvis Presley or Ella Fitzgerald.\\n So cry. It’s fine. And do it all night long if you want to, to one of Australia’s premier singer/songwriters. Benjamin Potter\\n Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Manana, Bad Bunny On Los Pits, the bouncy midpoint of his surprisingly menacing new album Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Manana, the world’s top streaming artist Bad Bunny – real name Benito Ocasio – breaks into a spoken-word shrug where he ponders that “the higher you are, the lower people want to see you fall”. After a half-decade of stratospheric global adoration, Bad Bunny is, understandably, feeling the tide turn.\\n Peaks are dangerous, and in 2023, Ocasio is firmly atop one. At February’s Grammys, he made history when his opus Un Verano Sin Ti became the first Spanish-language album to be nominated for album of the year in the organisation’s 64 years. In April, he became the first Spanish-language artist to headline Coachella. As well as a successful pivot to professional wrestling, in the months preceding he also made his blockbuster debut opposite Brad Pitt in Bullet Train, a role so well received that Sony executives tapped him for the lead in his own Spider-Man universe spin-off El Muerto, and a coming coronation as a true crossover multimedia star.\\n But he suddenly split from long-time partner Gabriela Berlingeri, denting his nice guy sheen. Worse, in his fans’ eyes, was his burgeoning dalliance with the world’s most divisive family – the Kardashians – after he started dating Kendall Jenner in early 2023. The relationship sparked such backlash that outlets suggested the Puerto Rican icon’s time at the top was buckling, that he was haemorrhaging followers towards a new crop of breakthrough Latin stars such as Mexico’s Peso Pluma and Colombia’s Feid. In a case of keep your potential usurpers close, Feid appears on Perro Negro, one of only two reggaeton tracks across Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Manana’s 22-song, 81-minute run-time.\\n Echoing Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts and Doja Cat’s Scarlet, the album – its title translates to “nobody knows what will happen tomorrow” – is another recent example of a pop star confronting the dark side of fame. You could call it Bad Bunny’s Reputation, the artist forced to reckon with a sudden shift in his public narrative. As with Taylor, he’s come out harder, meaner and desperate – a return to his “king of Latin trap” persona, but starker. If the music lacks the lilting melodicism and genre experimentation that made YHLQMDLG (2020) and Un Verano Sin Ti (2022) so idiosyncratic, it’s got an entertaining bite that’s all dog.\\n Even at his most menacing, Ocasio can’t not be charismatic and compelling. Opener Nadie Sabe is six minutes of frustration and resentment: it’s El Conejo bitterly attacking haters, disowning his fame, contending with public fallout and personal paranoia, and – among a laundry list of peeves – includes the great diss, “wow, que mucho podcast, que mucho baboso” (“such podcast, such slobbery”, essentially).\\n The hard mood continues on Mr October, on which Ocasio tries on an intimidating drill flow, and on the fantastic Vuelve Candy B. Named for the winningest thoroughbred in Puerto Rican horse racing history (it’d be like if, say, Briggs named a song after Winx), Ocasio compares himself to Tim Duncan and Messi for the 50th time and otherwise chides his haters (“visten oversize, pero conmigo estan apretao”, ie: “they dress oversized, but with me they’re pressed”). He also suggests the industry’s boring him and he’ll retire at 33, which only gives us four more years of this which is worrying.\\n There’s also a bit of exceptional flexing, Ocasio highlighting his star power. Monaco, whose music video features a cameo from Al Pacino (!), is built around a loopy sample of French crooner Charles Aznavour’s Hier Encore, as Ocasio reflects on the internet’s trash-talkers while he’s out at the Monaco GP watching Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez collecting chequered flags. Meanwhile, Vou 787 – citing Puerto Rico’s area code – is built on a choppy sample from Madonna’s Vogue. “If I was a woman, I’d be Madonna, I’d be Rihanna,” he quips.\\n If the album lacks the free-for-all creative exuberance of his previous works, the experimentation peeks through in bursts, culminating on the hectic Baticano, produced by Ocasio’s longtime collaborator Tainy (he produces around half the songs on the album). Built on loping, wonky, subterranean synths and an industrial beat that stutters unpredictably, the song is a provocation against Catholic conservatism and pious hypocrisy. That Ocasio’s verses include references to German midfielder Toni Kroos and purple Tellytubby Tinky-Winky is just part of the charm.\\n The whole thing ends with the more traditional reggaeton track Un Preview, including an intro from Ocasio where he suggests he’s giving us “a preview of what’s coming next”. No one’s gonna complain if El Conejo comes quick with a full slab of what he does best, but the message serves to highlight the bizarre nature of this stop-gap: he had some things to get off his chest (including a shot at his, it seems, ex-buddy J Balvin on Thunder y Lightning) and, well, he did it with his whole chest. Bad Bunny 1, detractors 0. Robert Moran\\n Something to Give Each Other, Troye Sivan  The nostalgia industrial complex is real. Pop culture knows that we all want to feel something in a time when we often feel nothing, and the easiest way to do that is to remind us of a time that is now lost. Remember when you were younger and it felt as though nothing mattered because life was infinite with possibility? Remember this song that made you feel like you’d never felt before?\\n There’s something lovely and yearning about it, but there’s also something deeply cynical. Interpolation and sampling in pop music is nothing new, but in the TikTok landscape, where every song has the potential to be snipped and become a viral sound, the huge influx of it feels like a calculated marketing masterstroke.\\n Perth-raised pop star Troye Sivan is not the first to do it and he certainly won’t be the last. His shimmering new single Got Me Started, which samples Bag Raiders’ 2008 hit Shooting Stars (the first time the electronic duo has ever cleared the sample) might be the exemplar of this. It’s an impossibly catchy song, but it also feels engineered for virality with the simplistic, almost lazy use of the sample – like a shade of a precious memory, on repeat forever.\\n Elsewhere on his third album, Something to Give Each Other, there are more songs that sound like they’re from a bygone era. The chorus of the woozy One of Your Girls strongly recalls Random Access Memories-era Daft Punk, in particular, the Julian Casablancas feature Instant Crush – vocoder-affected vocals and all. As sleek and well-crafted as these songs are, there is something about much of Something to Give Each Other that feels dated – like something you might hear on commercial radio in the early 2010s.\\n But it’s not all bad news. The record’s ecstatic first single, Rush, was inspired by poppers, dance floors and Melbourne’s Smith Street district, and conjures a time and place – and age. It’s another burst of nostalgia but in a much more idiosyncratic way.\\n That single’s chorus is sung, football chant-style, by a group of men before it swells into a pulsing, melting soundscape. It is at once hypermasculine and unapologetically queer, though in a way that represents a very specific subset of the culture – indeed, its orgiastic music video drew ire from viewers who claimed it perpetuates a damaging view of queer culture that focuses on a body ideal which does not represent the majority.\\n Sivan flits between earnest, honey-toned romantic odes (the bedroom pop-style yearning paean Still Got It, which includes some gorgeous vocal harmony; How to Stay With You; Can’t Go Back Baby) and the feral, bare-your-teeth horniness of Rush on the album’s more club-inspired moments. Tracks such as What’s the Time Where You Are strike a balance between the two, and Sivan’s smooth vocals and ear for melody make these songs largely a pleasure to listen to.\\n As with his previous two records, 2015’s Blue Neighbourhood and 2018’s Bloom, this album clocks in at a touch over half an hour. (Mention must be made to the excellent 2020 EP In a Dream, which used every one of its 22 minutes perfectly). In the fast-paced attention economy, Sivan aims for precision – most of these songs are the pop-perfect length of three minutes, though some, such as Rush, could stand to be a little longer to let their ideas disseminate further.\\n Sivan has evolved over the years from a teenage YouTuber to one of Australia’s most in-demand pop exports. Something to Give Each Other has moments of brilliance and emotional heft, while also demonstrating a growing trend in pop music that begs the question: if everything old is new again, is anything truly original? Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen\\n SuperBlue: The Iridescent Spree, Kurt Elling and Charlie Hunter Wearing his virtuosity on his sleeve, the young Kurt Elling liked to prove what an innovative singer he was at almost every turn, using radical vocal textures and dramatic changes of pitch and dynamics when delivering a song, let alone when improvising. The mature Elling, by contrast, has the innovation sewn into the music’s lining, rather than it popping out like a loud pocket handkerchief. He’s more content to let the music happen, rather than feeling that he bears the responsibility for making it happen.\\n Part of the process of arriving at this less self-conscious way of using his voice appears to have involved relinquishing sole leadership of his bands in favour of a series of collaborations, including this one alongside guitarist Charlie Hunter – another who used to be intent on shaking things up in his own way with his hybrid guitar/bass guitar.\\n Writing new material and covering that of others, together they have hit upon a slightly retro form of soul-jazz, ably assisted by DJ Harrison’s keyboards and Corey Fonville’s snappy drumming. Little Fairy Carpenter is among the strongest originals, Elling’s virtuosity completely deployed in the service of the song, so that every nuance of tone, texture and vibrato intensifies the lyric, as it drifts, cloudlike, over Hunter’s instantly attractive, breezy melody.\\n Bounce It certainly lives up to its title, and is superbly programmed to lead us into a biting rendition of Ornette Coleman’s Lonely Woman, which, now with words by Elling, is rechristened Only the Lonely Woman. Elling has taken what was always a desperately affecting melody and layered in a lyric of desolation, which he sings with something of the gritty wail of a saxophone, against the choppy funk of Fonville’s drums. Hunter and Harrison rightly let the voice take all the foreground, although the piece is so strong that an extended solo would not have been out of place. In fact, solos are in surprisingly short supply throughout the album, the average track length being a little under five minutes.\\n Besides Lonely Woman, Elling’s covers range from jazz singer Bob Dorough’s Naughty Number Nine to Ron Sexsmith’s soulful Right About Now and Joni Mitchell’s Black Crow – the latter opening the album and setting its tone, as it juxtaposes dreaminess and jaggedness. The band saves dialling the funk up to 11 for the group-written Not Here/Not Now, one of three songs augmented by a punchy horn arrangement.\\n In my first interview with Elling in the 1990s, he told me of the industry showcase gig he did in New York upon his arrival there from his native Chicago, and how the club hosting the event was lit up by the eerie blue glow of the assembled critics’ laptops. No wonder he felt a need to prove himself. Now he’s just making groovy music, consistently flecked with his humour, intelligence, daring, musicality and, yes, heart.

       "      'value': {'string_value': '<h3><b><em>All Night Long,</em> Caitlin Harnett and the Pony Boys</b></h3> <p>If it’s somewhat of a shock to hear that country music is back in vogue, then it’s not too far of a stretch to anticipate that you may not have been paying attention to Sydney’s inner west the past few years. It’s not unusual these days to find predominantly youthful punters packed in a crowded pub, sporting white Akubras and nodding heads in unison to a heavily tattooed, outspoken woman named Caitlin Harnett.</p> <p>Harnett and her backing band the Pony Boys command attention. A social media savvy output that matches their riotous onstage demeanour has helped solidify this unique Sydney band as a local stalwart – a group that not only made it cool again to yee-haw, but one that pays its respects to timeless Americana tinged with Harnett’s soulful, heart-rending vocals that croon of heartbreak, self-disillusionment and lingering grief.</p> <p><em>All Night Long</em> is somewhat of a sombre sophomore effort compared to 2020’s acclaimed <em>Late Night Essentials</em> – and this isn’t a bad thing. Behind Harnett’s tough-looking exterior, there’s a sensitive woman, and this time around she wants us to know that. <em>I’ll Get By</em>, <em>Sidelines</em> and <em>Can’t Have It All</em> speak of obvious frustration with an immature past love, the latter summing them up as “too big a mountain to climb”. Sure, ouch – but it’s rounded out almost instantly with an unforgettable sax melody that works incredibly well above the chorus-soaked guitars towards the last half of the track. It’s enough to make even the most regretful of the broken-hearted crack a nostalgic smile.</p> <p>“Even cowgirls cry, sometimes,” Harnett sings on lead single <em>Even Cowgirls Cry</em>, a foray into self-awareness and a message of hope to those who choose to bottle up their feelings rather than express them. But even Harnett can acknowledge she’s guilty of that herself. <em>Lil Ripper</em> speaks of a “big black dog sitting by my side”, and she sings of pressure on herself and laments the loss of her creative spirit for a moment in time, only to find it again and then some; it’s just one of the record’s highlights aided by a captivating, semi-strummed arpeggiated lead guitar riff that absolutely excels in the track’s last half, with guitarist Sam Montague busting into a formidable solo that I’m pretty sure peeled the paint off the walls of the studio they recorded at.</p> <p>It’s hard to believe Harnett has been wasting her time – a recurring theme on <em>All Night Long</em> – if you’re somewhat familiar with the Pony Boys’ engrossing touring schedule; something she doesn’t necessarily seem to have complaints over, but is introspective enough on <em>Living with Yourself</em> to know when her busy life as a musician has been messing with prioritising the most important thing, herself. She’s clearly not without faults, but a drive to succeed helps her cope: “My light’s still on and it’s burning”. It shows when we hit <em>If I Don’t Have You</em>, a slow-moving, sweet love ballad plucked straight out of the 1950s where Harnett’s marvellous vocal performance wouldn’t have sounded too out of place alongside the likes of Elvis Presley or Ella Fitzgerald.</p> <p>So cry. It’s fine. And do it all night long if you want to, to one of Australia’s premier singer/songwriters. <em><strong>Benjamin Potter</strong></em></p> <h3><b><em>Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Manana,</em> Bad Bunny</b></h3> <p>On <em>Los Pits</em>, the bouncy midpoint of his surprisingly menacing new album <em>Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Manana</em>, the world’s top streaming artist Bad Bunny – real name Benito Ocasio – breaks into a spoken-word shrug where he ponders that “the higher you are, the lower people want to see you fall”. After a half-decade of stratospheric global adoration, Bad Bunny is, understandably, feeling the tide turn.</p> <p>Peaks are dangerous, and in 2023, Ocasio is firmly atop one. At February’s Grammys, he made history when his opus <em>Un Verano Sin Ti</em> became the first Spanish-language album to be nominated for album of the year in the organisation’s 64 years. In April, he became the first Spanish-language artist to headline Coachella. As well as a successful pivot to professional wrestling, in the months preceding he also made his blockbuster debut opposite Brad Pitt in <em>Bullet Train</em>, a role so well received that Sony executives tapped him for the lead in his own Spider-Man universe spin-off <em>El Muerto</em>, and a coming coronation as a true crossover multimedia star.</p> <p>But he suddenly split from long-time partner Gabriela Berlingeri, denting his nice guy sheen. Worse, in his fans’ eyes, was his burgeoning dalliance with the world’s most divisive family – the Kardashians – after he started dating Kendall Jenner in early 2023. The relationship sparked such backlash that outlets suggested the Puerto Rican icon’s time at the top was buckling, that he was haemorrhaging followers towards a new crop of breakthrough Latin stars such as Mexico’s Peso Pluma and Colombia’s Feid. In a case of keep your potential usurpers close, Feid appears on <em>Perro Negro</em>, one of only two reggaeton tracks across <em>Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Manana</em>’s 22-song, 81-minute run-time.</p> <p>Echoing Olivia Rodrigo’s <em>Guts</em> and Doja Cat’s <em>Scarlet</em>, the album – its title translates to “nobody knows what will happen tomorrow” – is another recent example of a pop star confronting the dark side of fame.

A couple of weeks ago I had the chance to visit the site of my father’s old newsagency in Canberra. It was all shuttered up, but that didn’t stop me being hurled back in time.\\n The upside of working for a parent is you get to see them as a professional person, with skills. The downside is that they get to boss you about, even more than other parents.\\n From a young age, my father taught me the trade. The greeting cards don’t carry price stickers, he explained, as their exorbitant cost might put people off. But, on the back of the card, there was a string of printed numbers in which the Recommended Retail Price was embedded – but only to those given the key to the code.\\n How exciting. By the way, this is still the case. (Sorry to reveal a trade secret. I may have just betrayed the newsagent’s code.)\\n My father had also worked out that the daily newspapers were the lure that brought people into the shop, so they were placed against the back wall, so people had to walk the length of the shop to grab a copy – past the display of snow domes featuring Parliament House, past the wooden unit featuring coloured cardboard sheets for school projects, and past the copious offerings of nudie magazines.

This was about self-improvement. For a couple of dollars, and then a bit extra for the “folders” or “binders”, you could build up what was essentially an encyclopedia about World War Two, or Classical Music (by the ’80s, a free CD with every copy), or the Amazing World of Nature.\\n It’s true that most of my adolescence was spent selling overpriced birthday cards, cigarettes, and frankly appalling pornography, but I take pleasure in this one thing: the partworks.

A couple of weeks ago I had the chance to visit the site of my father’s old newsagency in Canberra. It was all shuttered up, but that didn’t stop me being hurled back in time.</p> <p>The upside of working for a parent is you get to see them as a professional person, with skills. The downside is that they get to boss you about, even more than other parents.</p> <p>From a young age, my father taught me the trade. The greeting cards don’t carry price stickers, he explained, as their exorbitant cost might put people off. But, on the back of the card, there was a string of printed numbers in which the Recommended Retail Price was embedded – but only to those given the key to the code.</p> <p>How exciting. By the way, this is still the case. (Sorry to reveal a trade secret. I may have just betrayed the newsagent’s code.)</p> <p>My father had also worked out that the daily newspapers were the lure that brought people into the shop, so they were placed against the back wall, so people had to walk the length of the shop to grab a copy – past the display of snow domes featuring Parliament House, past the wooden unit featuring coloured cardboard sheets for school projects, and past the copious offerings of nudie magazines.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'Immersion Lure, Phil Slater The desiccating effects of age are not all bad. Phil Slater’s trumpet sound, for instance, has steadily become more austere, less lush and romantic, across the years. Something similar has befallen his composing, too. While this slightly compresses the music’s emotional range, it makes the spikes in that range more telling. Often these now have a chilling quality, like a sudden blast of wind when a door is opened to a storm.\\n Slater’s collaborators are of one mind. Partly his asceticism is contagious, partly the compositions demand this approach, and partly his colleagues have moved in a similar musical direction with the passing years. Pianist Matt McMahon and drummer Simon Barker have now shared projects with Slater for over three decades, and the instant rapport evident in the early days has only deepened. Bassist Brett Hirst and tenor saxophonist Matt Keegan, meanwhile, have long ceased to be the relatively new kids on the Slater block.\\n Rhythmically, the music tends towards gentleness and sparseness, so the melodic lines don’t have to work at dominating the foreground. The intent is to cast spells: to draw you into hypnotic patterns, only for Slater to impale you on slicing lines that, in the case of the title track, gradually rise in pitch, until the trumpet notes become a silvery stream of devastating impact, delivered with exceptional evenness of tone across the instrument’s range.\\n Rigour and discipline are major elements, but never ends in themselves. On Blossom, for instance, the restraint evokes the delicacy of the title, like time-lapse photography of a flower gradually unfurling into something more lavish, at which point elation and despair become jumbled, because beauty and sadness are almost always inseparable twins.\\n Helping Keegan make such telling statements is the fact that he dares to push so little breath through his saxophone, so the edges of the notes are blurred and smudged, as sketch artists do to hard lines with the heel of their hands. The piano, bass and drums insinuate themselves around the horns, darting to the foreground for a moment and then retreating into the loosely woven rhythmic texture, always with a keen sense of sustaining the total aesthetic that’s in play. It’s only on the closing Panoramic that they fill more of the picture, and, as the title suggests, that frame keeps widening, until there are endless details on which to focus, with the piece also being the album’s most rhythmically robust.\\n Having a vision that is this distinctive in the jazz pantheon is improbable, as is finding the perfect people to realise it, so this may prove one of the timeless records of Australian music. It’s one to stop you in your tracks for its duration and lure you into a world that is the poetic antidote to our prosaic daily lives, while using austerity to magnify endless simple beauties – the sonic equivalent of taking time to smell the flowers. John Shand\\n Think Later, Tate McRae Tate McRae’s career, until recently, had a stench of desperation about it. That’s a wild thing to say about someone who’s only 20, but how else to describe the feeling you get watching an artist who trades explicitly in classic pop moves failing to grab the mode such musical expression necessitates, ie: popularity?\\n Despite her age, the Calgary-born musician’s already had a journey. A professionally trained dancer since 6, at 13 she finished third on the US version of So You Think You Can Dance and attracted record label attention with songs uploaded to YouTube. In 2020, her weeper You Broke Me First had a chart moment, leading to her debut I Used To Think I Can Fly in 2022, an intriguing album of thrashy bangers and post-Billie Eilish sad-pop featuring production from pop titans Greg Kurstin (Adele) and Finneas (Eilish). It had at least one could’ve been smash – the spiky What Would You Do? – but, fairly listless despite her swaggering delivery, it failed to ignite with either mainstream audiences or pop aesthetes.\\n But then, this past August, Greedy happened. Used in a video by popular TikToker Tube Girl and then in countless hair-flip transition clips, the song went viral, eventually amassing over 320 million streams globally, topping charts internationally, and becoming McRae’s proper breakthrough and a rare reintroduction. It even landed her a slot on Saturday Night Live, that pop superstar rite-of-passage, and sold out shows for her upcoming Australian tour next November.\\n That Greedy’s the thing that’s pushed McRae to the next level is somewhat confounding. Is it even a good song? It’s not particularly memorable, and McRae’s debut had better tracks that slipped listeners by. But its sassy sentiment – “I would want myself”, particularly suited to clips of youthful coming-of-age expression – clearly caught on with the TikTok crowd, which is how pop stardom happens these days. In another popstar move, McRae also channelled an alter ego (Tatiana, who’s “ballsy, loud and obnoxious”) for Greedy’s vibrant music video, a fun throwback to choreographed Y2K-era aesthetics – McRae dancing all lustily on a Zamboni (so Canadian) – which surely helped.\\n In this context comes Think Later, McRae’s sophomore release. Almost completely produced and co-written with Ryan Tedder (OneRepublic), it sports his hit-making trademarks, for better or worse – pristine songcraft hooked around off-kilter concepts that can’t help but catch the ear, but punishingly midtempo, songs searching for gravitas over, say, fun. For an album that’s supposed to be McRae’s bold, confident, cheeky makeover, parts of it lack spark.\\n Tellingly, the best songs on the album – Exes, Hurt My Feelings and Guilty Conscience – follow the Greedy template: skittering Timbaland-style beats recalling Y2K-era pop, all syncopated and staccato and sultry kiss-offs to dumb boys. They feel strong and personally nostalgic – like McRae’s nodding to her countrywoman Nelly Furtado’s classic mid-’00s run – but driven by McRae’s playfulness.\\n We’re Not Alike shows another promising side to McRae’s sound, a post-punky thing built on an Interpol-ish riff that slyly builds into something anthemic, recalling her pal Olivia Rodrigo’s sleeper Guts track, Pretty Isn’t Pretty (the post-punk revival has officially returned to pop, it seems).\\n That these songs are so interesting makes the album’s overemphasis on understated ballads frustrating. Songs like opener Cut My Hair, Grave and Stay Done are slick but dour affairs, the classic Tedder formula. Messier, which weirdly is not another Canadian nod to ice hockey great Mark, shows McRae has the range, a bitter ballad where she allows her vocals to get raw and unhinged.\\n But the real pleasure of Think Later lies in McRae’s idiosyncrasies and their potential; she’s a throwback in the classic singing-dancing Britney mould. With a pop landscape led by serious singer-songwriters like Taylor Swift, SZA, Rodrigo and Eilish; Dua “go girl, give us nothing” Lipa; the fame-trolling Doja Cat; and the introverted to the point of obscurity PinkPantheress, there’s a vacancy for McRae’s particular set of popstar skills. If she’s greedy enough, the platform feels like it’s hers to grab. Robert Moran\\n I/O, Peter Gabriel For a guy who spent much of the ’70s at the forefront of prog-rock as the singer for Genesis, creating sprawling concept albums, wearing a series of increasingly bizarre stage outfits that suggested he had ingested a truckload of acid on the way to a Halloween party, and being one of the main reasons punk had to happen, Peter Gabriel sure did go on to personify big, shiny ’80s pop.\\n The most played video on MTV? That would be Sledgehammer, his body slam of a hit from 1986 that did just what it said on the tin. The song blaring from that boombox John Cusack held aloft under Ione Skye’s window in the iconic scene from 1989’s Say Anything? That would be Gabriel’s In Your Eyes. And, somewhat bizarrely, you can barely watch an old episode of Miami Vice without hearing a Gabriel song in the background.\\n From popularising the massive, heavily gated drum sound that dominated the era to becoming one of world music’s greatest champions by co-founding the WOMAD festival, for a while there Gabriel was seemingly everywhere.\\n And then… he wasn’t. In fact, I/O is his first solo album of new original material in over two decades. Some wags are calling it his Chinese Democracy, but the rarely punctual Axl Rose only took a comparatively brisk 18 years to finally release the follow-up to Use Your Illusion.\\n Some things haven’t changed. From the get-go, on opening track Panopticom, there’s that gunshots-in-an-echo-chamber drum sound and the instantly recognisable fat, slithering tones of long-time bassist Tony Levin. And the subject matter is the familiar, big-world thinking we’ve come to expect, too – in this case, Gabriel’s utopian idea of an infinitely expandable and accessible world database, but, you know, one that doesn’t peddle untruths.\\n The title track could almost come from Coldplay, with its singalong chorus designed for arena crowds waving lit-up smartphones, while Gabriel sings “stuff coming out, stuff going in, I’m just a part of everything”.\\n In the late ’90s, Gabriel collaborated with Randy Newman on That’ll Do from the Babe soundtrack. Should Newman be indisposed for the next Pixar film soundtrack, Gabriel’s Playing For Time could easily slot in for that reflective, tear-inducing, life-affirming ballad Newman routinely provides for the end of the second act.\\n In fact, there’s a palpable sense of mortality on I/O. Gabriel is 73, and he’s mining a seam of material here about taking stock, feeling at one with the world and the (admittedly, not exactly original) realisation that love is all we need. This reaches its most intense moment in And Still, a song he wrote to deal with the death of his mother in 2016. It’s a fragile, delicate thing that has an almost Nick Drake transparency to it, as he remembers leaning his head against her skin and the feeling of her brushing his hair as a young boy.\\n But with all that time spent cooking up these songs, some have been left in the oven too long, stretching to five, six, seven minutes, and in need of an edit or at least a change in tempo. Olive Tree and Live and Let Live overload the “one with the world” barrow he’s pushing – the former, a Sting-like concoction that seems to be two different songs bolted together; the latter, coming from a fine place (inspired by Nelson Mandela and The Elders project) but littered with cliches such as “When we can forgive, we can move on” and “An eye for an eye, again and again, until the whole world is blind”.\\n On top of all this, there are two mixes of the album, one a “bright-side mix” by Mark “Spike” Stent, and the other a “dark-side mix” by Tchad Blake. Yes, it’s a lot to take in. But then, it’s been a while in the making. And who knows when, or if, we’ll get a follow-up?

If she’s greedy enough, the platform feels like it’s hers to grab. <em><strong>Robert Moran</strong></em></p> <h3><b><em><i>I/O</i>,</em> Peter Gabriel</b></h3> <p>For a guy who spent much of the ’70s at the forefront of prog-rock as the singer for Genesis, creating sprawling concept albums, wearing a series of increasingly bizarre stage outfits that suggested he had ingested a truckload of acid on the way to a Halloween party, and being one of the main reasons punk had to happen, Peter Gabriel sure did go on to personify big, shiny ’80s pop.</p> <p>The most played video on MTV? That would be <i>Sledgehammer,</i> his body slam of a hit from 1986 that did just what it said on the tin. The song blaring from that boombox John Cusack held aloft under Ione Skye’s window in the iconic scene from 1989’s <i>Say Anything</i>? That would be Gabriel’s <i>In Your Eyes.</i> And, somewhat bizarrely, you can barely watch an old episode of <i>Miami Vice</i> without hearing a Gabriel song in the background.</p> <p>From popularising the massive, heavily gated drum sound that dominated the era to becoming one of world music’s greatest champions by co-founding the WOMAD festival, for a while there Gabriel was seemingly everywhere.</p> <p>And then… he wasn’t. In fact, <i>I/O</i> is his first solo album of new original material in over two decades. Some wags are calling it his <i>Chinese Democracy</i>, but the rarely punctual Axl Rose only took a comparatively brisk 18 years to finally release the follow-up to <i>Use Your Illusion.</i></p> <p>Some things haven’t changed. From the get-go, on opening track <i>Panopticom,</i> there’s <i>that</i> gunshots-in-an-echo-chamber drum sound and the instantly recognisable fat, slithering tones of long-time bassist Tony Levin. And the subject matter is the familiar, big-world thinking we’ve come to expect, too – in this case, Gabriel’s utopian idea of an infinitely expandable and accessible world database, but, you know, one that doesn’t peddle untruths.</p> <p>The title track could almost come from Coldplay, with its singalong chorus designed for arena crowds waving lit-up smartphones, while Gabriel sings “stuff coming out, stuff going in, I’m just a part of everything”.</p> <p>In the late ’90s, Gabriel collaborated with Randy Newman on <i>That’ll Do</i> from the <i>Babe</i> soundtrack. Should Newman be indisposed for the next Pixar film soundtrack, Gabriel’s <i>Playing For Time </i>could easily slot in for that reflective, tear-inducing, life-affirming ballad Newman routinely provides for the end of the second act.</p> <p>In fact, there’s a palpable sense of mortality on <i>I/O. </i>Gabriel is 73, and he’s mining a seam of material here about taking stock, feeling at one with the world and the (admittedly, not exactly original) realisation that love is all we need. This reaches its most intense moment in <i>And Still,</i> a song he wrote to deal with the death of his mother in 2016. It’s a fragile, delicate thing that has an almost Nick Drake transparency to it, as he remembers leaning his head against her skin and the feeling of her brushing his hair as a young boy.</p> <p>But with all that time spent cooking up these songs, some have been left in the oven too long, stretching to five, six, seven minutes, and in need of an edit or at least a change in tempo. <i>Olive Tree </i>and <i>Live and Let Live</i> overload the “one with the world” barrow he’s pushing – the former, a Sting-like concoction that seems to be two different songs bolted together; the latter, coming from a fine place (inspired by Nelson Mandela and <i>The Elders</i> project) but littered with cliches such as “When we can forgive, we can move on” and “An eye for an eye, again and again, until the whole world is blind”.</p> <p>On top of all this, there are two mixes of the album, one a “bright-side mix” by Mark “Spike” Stent, and the other a “dark-side mix” by Tchad Blake. Yes, it’s a lot to take in. But then, it’s been a while in the making. And who knows when, or if, we’ll get a follow-up? <em><strong>Barry Divola</strong></em></p> <p><b>To read more from</b><b><i> Spectrum</i></b><b>, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/spectrum-smh-hog\" target=\"_blank\">visit our page here</a>.</b></p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56kr7\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>'}},\n",

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nChinongwa\\nLucy Mushita, Spinifex, $29.95\\n Some of the best current writing comes from Africa and its diaspora. Lucy Mushita lives in France and Australia, but in her first novel looks back at her birthplace, Zimbabwe. In the last century, the white colonisers, called kneeless (vasinamabvi), ruled. They impoverished the country, and traditional patriarchy meant the women suffered most. Chinongwa was only nine, but her family had little choice but to sell her into marriage. She was walked between villages, fruitlessly, until an act of calculating pity made her a secondary wife. The husband and his child-bride both bitterly resented their union. It produced 10 children but no happiness. The story may be grim, but it has a compelling power. Chinongwa may have been a chattel, but she still had agency and voice. And at the end of the novel she achieved her personal independence, though not that of her nation.\\n Orphan Road\\nAndrew Nette, Down & Out, $31.99\\n The hard-boiled genre novel in Australia is as old as A. E. Martin’s 1944 The Misplaced Corpse, with splendid PI Rosie Bosanky. Peter Corris followed, but the tradition is intermittent.\\n The latest carrier of the baton is Andrew Nette, with his series detective, the colourful Chance. More Garry Disher’s Wyatt than investigator, trouble follows Chance like a drover’s dog. Here a modern crime, real estate extortion, links to the famed Great Bookie Robbery, and a fortune in hot diamonds. Into the mix is thrown the Vietnam War, skullduggery from police and the CIA, even the mob. The crime arises organically from its surroundings, ever-seedy Melbourne. The motion is frenetic, alliances made and broken, with doses of violence. To my mind it needed another chapter or so, but that might have lost the narrative completely.\\n Burn\\nMelanie Saward, Affirm, $34.99\\n\\nWriting adolescent boys is difficult. When they are also Indigenous, marginalised and with psychological problems, the debut novelist should surely beware. Yet Melanie Saward admirably creates a credible central character in Andrew. Against his background, a boy’s view of Tasmania and Brisbane, he struggles to survive socially and emotionally. The book could be aimed at the young adult market, but school libraries would object to the realism of bongs and teen sex. Rather it is pitched as a psychological thriller, Andrew being also a firebug. What triggers him is complex, the author’s research propelling rather than slowing the narrative. Where the book seems less assured is in the use of thriller techniques, particularly in the latter stages. These are tricky even for seasoned authors. Overall Burn is far more than promising, and the reader awaits the next book along.\\n The Seventh Son\\nSebastian Faulks, Hutchinson Heinemann, $34.99\\n Fiction about Neanderthals ranges from Isaac Asimov, William Golding to James Bradley, and now Sebastian Faulks. His topic is in constant flux, with amazing discoveries. It risks a novel’s sudden obsolescence. Moreover, he is out of his usual historical territory. Conveying complex science is also tricky, though Faulks has a red-hot go with making synthetic sperm. Here, mad scientists do not figure, rather an eccentric billionaire. Resurrection Biology using IVF produces Seth, 51 per cent Neanderthal. He is hybrid enough to attend Oxford, but not enough to integrate fully into modern society. Or could he? Neanderthals left descendants via Homo sapiens, suggesting affinity. Horses and donkeys are similar equines, but their offspring are sterile. Faulks avoids idealising Seth as wild man or savant Other, but he does not engage as a character. Choice of nitpick: Seth’s inability to swim is blamed on Neanderthals, but in 2019 they were proved to have suffered more surfer’s ear than modern humans.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nWould that be Funny?\\nLorin Clarke, Text, $34.99\\n When Lorin Clarke was growing up, it was not uncommon for strangers to ask if her father, the beloved satirist John Clarke, was “funny at home”. Her answer, in this memoir, is emphatic. “He was outrageously, consistently, shockingly, will-I-ever-breathe-again hilarious’.′ Having an argument with him as a teenager was infuriating. On one occasion, she found herself laughing and stomping her foot at the same time. Fittingly oblique and conversational in style, Lorin’s narrative builds a kaleidoscopic picture of her childhood and her father, interspersed with key words from the Clarke/English dictionary and other snippets of family lore. Full of tender and wacky anecdotes, Would that be Funny? also subtly teases out John’s fraught relationship with his father, how it shaped his comedy and outlook, and pays tribute to the transformative and anchoring influence of his wife, Helen.\\n 21st-Century Virtues: How They Are Failing Our Democracy\\nLucinda Holdforth, Monash University Publishing, $19.95\\n True to her name, Lucinda Holdforth doesn’t hold back and Hallelujah for that. Right-wing extremism is on the rise, democracy is in peril. But are the lauded virtues of our time, authenticity, empathy, humility and vulnerability, up to the task? What bothers Holdforth about the modern iteration of these virtues is that they are self-referential, and that this cult of self is being monetised by neo-liberalism. When those in the public eye talk about authenticity, they are often referring to their “personal brand”. Humility has become similarly performative. Take Rupert Murdoch’s carefully crafted confession that being grilled by British MPs over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal was “the most humble day of my life”. This invigorating essay shows how these virtues have been emptied and exploited, and makes a plea for shared strengths and communal courage.\\n Wandering Through Life\\nDonna Leon, Hutchinson Heinemann, $35\\n Readers familiar with Donna Leon’s popular crime novels set in Venice – there are more than 30 of them so far – may be surprised to hear that she regards herself as almost completely lacking in ambition.\\n Now in her early 80s, she says she’s simply doing what gives her the greatest joy: spending time with her characters and immersing herself in opera. This is not a conventional memoir so much as a series of droll, discreet and affectionate reflections on people and incidents in her life from her childhood in the US to her time in Italy. Not inclined to self-revelation or to taking herself too seriously, the closest she gets to hinting at a philosophy of life is when she’s talking about her great musical love, Handel. “He was a popular entertainer. He had no great theories, no great life concepts ... He was a workman who wanted to give endless pleasure to his public.” The same could be said about Leon.\\n Back Up\\nLiam Mannix, NewSouth, $34.99\\n There’s something liberating about having everything you thought you knew about a subject – in this case, back pain – upended. And then to find that these very assumptions are part of the problem. “To get a spinal image is to open a Pandora’s box,” says Liam Mannix, a journalist on this masthead. Plenty of people have all sorts of back degeneration and no pain. Conversely, an image of disc bulge, bone spurs or other signs of deterioration can “worm its way inside your brain” and prime it to sense pain. Other myths about back pain include the belief that there is “good posture” and “bad posture”, that our backs are fragile and must not be stressed, and the doozy of them all, that ergonomics makes any difference. On top of this, there’s rampant over-servicing in the form of spinal surgery and steroid injections. This is an empowering deconstruction of the stories we tell ourselves about our bodies and our pain.\\n THE BOOKLIST\\nThe Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

Don and Rosie are such beguiling characters any reader wanted to follow their lives. There was no doubt about the exhilaration of reading that first novel. The jokes were visual and hilarious, and in some mysterious way the author’s intelligence lit every page.\\n And every reader wondered if the endearingly infuriating Don was perhaps autobiographical. This new book might help with inquiries. Creative Differences and Other Stories is an unusual collection of nine pieces written over the industrious Simsion’s career. Some are fiction, some written for newspapers, some commissioned, some as prize entries.\\n And just over half the book is a short novel, Creative Differences. It addresses two opposing ways to write a novel: detailed plotting or flying by the seat of your pants. Scott has the steel-trap mind that problem-solves and makes jokes, Emily has access to the Muses. They have been happily together for three years, creatively and in life, but trouble lands with the arrival of Piper, who wants to use both of them to let her own genius out of its cage.

I’m afraid all this swished past me.\\n An idle thought crossed my mind: is Simsion’s braininess overkill? Followed by another just as idle: when does clever tip into smart-arse? Simsion’s qualities worked in the tenderly handled, emotionally thin Rosie novels, resulting in the exhilarating fun, but I want to say “hmm?” here. For my money, this would work better as audible.\\n The nine pieces that comprise the first half of the book are engaging. Confession in Three Parts, a story-within-a story about two generations of women doctors, is a direct O. Henry descendant, shocking and satisfying. Another, Three Encounters With the Physical, was the runner-up in The Age 2013 short-story competition. A man goes on his first marathon. He’s 51. He’s obsessive, even when his body is telling him to stop or he will die. He will not.\\n A few weeks later he is diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis: his muscles had melted down and his kidneys could not deal with the waste that they dumped into the bloodstream. (It’s important to know about this stuff.) These short, sharp stories reveal the best of Simsion: curious, interested in the world and with a whimsical ability to report his findings. I want to say “tra-la!” here.\\n For me, the outstanding piece is a short essay about Simsion and his partner, Anne, almost midway on an 80-day walk from southern Burgundy to Rome. They’ve been following the paths dedicated to St Francis of Assisi and not at all overpopulated like the famous Camino de Santiago. On the border of Piedmont and Liguria, dusty and weary, their only option for a meal and the night is a dubious hotel.

No one calls here any more.\\n Then a slight miracle happens and … well, you must read it, especially if you know M.F.K Fisher.

       "      'value': {'string_value': 'CBD was enthralled to learn that residents of Brighton were being invited last week to board free buses to take them to Monday night’s recording of the Stan Grant-hosted Q+A at the ABC’s Southbank studios.\\n Those denizens of the upmarket bayside neighbourhood lucky enough to be on the show’s mailing list were invited to take a 12-kilometre ride into town to watch assistant minister Matt Thistlethwaite, Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, lawyer Teela Reid, author Pragya Agerwal and playwright David Hare talk about superannuation, free speech, the monarchy and the Indigenous Voice to parliament.\\n Now, Brighton’s population is considerably older than average, and it’s not unusual for the broadcaster to bus audiences into the show. Turns out, they do it all the time “as part of getting the audience mix right”, a spokesperson told us.\\n We had other questions, too, like why did people in Brighton — where the median weekly income is nearly 1000 bucks higher than the state’s average, and which has three train stations — need help getting into the city? And were buses sent to other parts of town, maybe to neighbourhoods where you’d struggle to find someone with $3 million or more in their super fund?\\n Here’s what we got.\\n “Q+A provides weekly bus services from a range of areas with different demographics and voting intentions,” the spokesperson said.\\n “The opportunity is often taken up by a variety of community groups, in particular students and older residents who otherwise wouldn’t be able to join the broadcast.”\\n STYLISH EXIT With only three weeks to go until the new David Jones owners take over, Melbourne fashionistas were unsure if Saturday night’s party/show at the city’s flagship store would have a fall-of-Rome bacchanalian feel, or something more zipped up, like a Maticevski dress, and there was no dress code on the invitation to provide a clue.\\n But DJs boss Scott Fyfe, looking casual in a T-shirt, blazer and joggers, solved the mystery when he reliably informed attendees that there were no suits — or turtlenecks — from new owner Anchorage Capital in the house.\\n As for the party, it looked like outgoing owners, South Africa-based Woolworths Holdings, were keen not to let too much bubbly spill on their way out the door, opting for a toned-down pre-show soiree, in what is usually the Level 1 caff at Bourke Street.\\n But the 600 guests, including Julie Bishop and Kate Waterhouse, were relieved to find the sparkling wine was still French (Bollinger) and the show, itself, treated the audience to a whopping 200 “exits” — that’s outfits in fashion parlance.\\n The crowd was “invited” at the end of the evening to exit via the Emporium shopping centre — the back entrance, really — only to find most of the escalators and doors locked, until a group of partygoers staged a mutiny, and stormed an escalator rather than wait eons for the single operating lift.\\n The eventual door to freedom was out the side entrance, to a loading bay.\\n Fashionable indeed.\\n FIRM FRIENDS If anybody’s expecting fireworks from the appearance by Australian Consumer and Competition Commission chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb in Sydney on Tuesday, facilitated by her former law firm colleague, Elizabeth Avery, then they’re probably better off staying home.\\n Cass-Gottlieb’s “enforcement and compliance policy update”, her first since replacing the high-profile Rod Sims in the ACCC’s top job a year ago, is being hosted by the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia.\\n Cass-Gottlieb and Avery, Gilbert and Tobin’s competition and regulation partner, are good mates, with Avery gushing about Cass-Gottlieb’s “brilliance, dedication and hard work” when news broke of her appointment to lead the ACCC.\\n The two former colleagues shared a stage just last month when Gilbert and Tobin hosted Cass-Gottlieb for a chat about the regulation of unfair trading practices.\\n So don’t expect too many screaming headlines to emerge from Tuesday’s session. Cass-Gottlieb has been, let’s say, circumspect on the news-making front since taking the reins at the ACCC.\\n But then, most people look media-shy compared to Sims.\\n ALL GROWN UP For a media company that has become the darling of Australian progressives, Schwartz Publishing is certainly copping it from internet lefties.\\n Just days after owner Morry Schwartz weighed into the culture war engulfing the Adelaide Writers’ Week, his company, through its Black Inc. Books imprint, found itself mired in the boggy intersection of mental illness and identity politics.\\n It started when Black Inc. put out submissions for an anthology entitled Growing Up Neurodivergent In Australia, part of a series exploring various identities and edited by Bachelor host Osher Gunsberg.\\n But the publisher was accepting submissions only from people with a “medical diagnosis”, which prompted allegations of gatekeeping and ableism amid a furious backlash against the TV host.\\n Within days, Black Inc. put out a statement apologising for any pain caused, and announcing the project would be put on hold.\\n In his own statement, Gunsberg said that limitation was “in the interests of protecting those who are yet to seek intervention, and to be ethically responsible in how this issue is presented”.\\n We bet he regrets walking into that minefield.\\n The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

And were buses sent to other parts of town, maybe to neighbourhoods where you’d struggle to find someone with <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/that-s-a-lot-of-money-to-have-in-a-super-fund-nab-chief-backs-tax-hike-20230303-p5cp4k.html\" target=\"_blank\">$3 million or more</a> in their super fund?</p> <p>Here’s what we got.</p> <p>“<em>Q+A</em> provides weekly bus services from a range of areas with different demographics and voting intentions,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>“The opportunity is often taken up by a variety of community groups, in particular students and older residents who otherwise wouldn’t be able to join the broadcast.”</p> <h3>STYLISH EXIT</h3> <p>With only three weeks to go until the new David Jones owners take over, Melbourne fashionistas were unsure if Saturday night’s party/show at the city’s flagship store would have a fall-of-Rome bacchanalian feel, or something more zipped up, like a Maticevski dress, and there was no dress code on the invitation to provide a clue.</p> <p>But DJs boss <b>Scott Fyfe</b>, looking casual in a T-shirt, blazer and joggers, solved the mystery when he reliably informed attendees that there were no suits — or turtlenecks — from new owner <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/business/companies/david-jones-to-change-hands-on-a-high-20230301-p5coo5.html\" target=\"_blank\">Anchorage Capital</a> in the house.</p> <p>As for the party, it looked like outgoing owners, South Africa-based Woolworths Holdings, were keen not to let too much bubbly spill on their way out the door, opting for a toned-down pre-show soiree, in what is usually the Level 1 caff at Bourke Street.</p> <p>But the 600 guests, including <b>Julie Bishop</b> and <b>Kate Waterhouse</b>, were relieved to find the sparkling wine was still French (Bollinger) and the show, itself, treated the audience to a whopping 200 “exits” — that’s outfits in fashion parlance.</p> <p>The crowd was “invited” at the end of the evening to exit via the Emporium shopping centre — the back entrance, really — only to find most of the escalators and doors locked, until a group of partygoers staged a mutiny, and stormed an escalator rather than wait eons for the single operating lift.</p> <p>The eventual door to freedom was out the side entrance, to a loading bay.</p> <p>Fashionable indeed.</p> <h3>FIRM FRIENDS</h3> <p>If anybody’s expecting fireworks from the appearance by Australian Consumer and Competition Commission chair <b>Gina Cass-Gottlieb</b> in Sydney on Tuesday, facilitated by her former law firm colleague, <b>Elizabeth Avery</b>, then they’re probably better off staying home.</p> <p>Cass-Gottlieb’s “enforcement and compliance policy update”, her first since replacing the high-profile <b>Rod Sims</b> in the ACCC’s top job a year ago, is being hosted by the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/first-woman-appointed-to-run-competition-watchdog-20211214-p59hdd.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cass-Gottlieb</a> and Avery, Gilbert and Tobin’s competition and regulation partner, are good mates, with Avery gushing about Cass-Gottlieb’s “brilliance, dedication and hard work” when news broke of her appointment to lead the ACCC.</p> <p>The two former colleagues shared a stage just last month when Gilbert and Tobin hosted Cass-Gottlieb for a chat about the regulation of unfair trading practices.</p> <p>So don’t expect too many screaming headlines to emerge from Tuesday’s session. Cass-Gottlieb has been, let’s say, circumspect on the news-making front since taking the reins at the ACCC.</p> <p>But then, most people look media-shy compared to Sims.</p> <h3>ALL GROWN UP</h3> <p>For a media company that has become the darling of Australian progressives, Schwartz Publishing is certainly copping it from internet lefties.</p> <p>Just days after owner <strong>Morry Schwartz</strong> <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/books/schwartz-media-owner-calls-for-louise-adler-to-resign-from-festival-20230222-p5cmrn.html\" target=\"_blank\">weighed</a> into the culture war engulfing the Adelaide Writers’ Week, his company, through its Black Inc. Books imprint, found itself mired in the boggy intersection of mental illness and identity politics.</p> <p>It started when Black Inc. put out submissions for an anthology entitled <i>Growing Up Neurodivergent In Australia, </i>part of a series exploring various identities and edited by <em>Bachelor</em> host<strong> Osher Gunsberg</strong>.</p> <p>But the publisher was accepting submissions only from people with a “medical diagnosis”, which prompted allegations of gatekeeping and ableism amid a furious backlash against the TV host.</p> <p>Within days, Black Inc. put out a statement apologising for any pain caused, and announcing the project would be put on hold.</p> <p>In his own statement, Gunsberg said that limitation was “in the interests of protecting those who are yet to seek intervention, and to be ethically responsible in how this issue is presented”.</p> <p>We bet he regrets walking into that minefield.</p> <p><b><i>The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. </i></b><b><i>Sign up here</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>'}},\n",

       "  'description': '<p>Curtis Sittenfeld likes to pose questions with her novels. What if Hillary had refused to marry Bill? (<em>Rodham.</em>) What if <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> was set in contemporary times? (<em>Eligible.</em>) Why did Democrat-raised librarian Laura Bush marry boisterous Republican George W? (<em>American Wife</em>.)</p> <p>There’s an entertainment tradition of ordinary looking talented men pairing with spectacularly beautiful women. But it would never happen if the genders were reversed – would it? That’s the premise of Sittenfeld’s sixth novel.</p> <p>Sally Milner is a writer for <em>TNO</em>, a fictional <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. When her colleague Danny becomes engaged to a gorgeous celebrity, Sally writes a mocking sketch – The Danny Horst Rule – embodying the novel’s premise. That week, as she helps “cheesily handsome” pop-star guest host Noah write his own sketch, she feels an attraction spark. But it can’t be mutual – can it?</p> <p>The narrative tension, as with any romantic comedy, lies not in whether an attraction exists, or even if it will be consummated, so much as how that will happen, and the specifics of the obstacles they’ll overcome. An awareness of these genre mechanics is written into the novel.</p> <p>Sally’s ambition is “to write non-condescending, ragingly feminist screenplays for romantic comedies”. She tells Noah, “When one of these movies doesn’t work, it’s usually because it’s horribly written and/or because the script hasn’t done the work of convincing you the couple is attracted to each other, so then you don’t care if obstacles get in their way and keep them apart.”</p> <p>Sittenfeld creates a convincing connection between Sally and Noah: they describe their creative work – her comedy and his music – as the loves of their lives. So it makes sense that work is how their true selves are revealed and connect.</p> <p>The conflict between our public and private selves has been central to Sittenfeld’s work since her debut, <em>Prep</em>, whose hyperaware, awkward teen protagonist embodied it. Sally suspects much of her writing emerges from that tension. And she tells Noah, “Sometimes I feel like I’m writing dialogue for the character of myself. I’m impersonating a normal human being when really I’m a confused freak.”</p> <p>This aspect of Sally feels palpably real and suits a comedy writer: humour as armour; a protective layer to shield the real, vulnerable self. And theories such as the Danny Horst Rule feel like believable ways of protecting against romantic rejection.</p> <p>Sally hasn’t allowed herself to have real relationships since a fellow <em>TNO</em> writer denied a mutual attraction she’d imagined, years ago. (Another Sittenfeld theme: young Hillary misreads male friendships in <em>Rodham</em>, and a similar situation plays out in the title story of Sittenfeld’s collection, <em>You Think It, I’ll Say It</em>.) “You’ve confused the romance of comedy with the comedy of romance,” Sally’s colleague told her.</p> <p>It’s a good line. But there aren’t enough of them in <em>Romantic Comedy</em>. Sittenfeld can be a master of sardonic, devastatingly arch observational wit. She employed it beautifully in <em>Eligible</em>; perhaps it helped to borrow the skeleton of the most popular romantic comedy of all time.</p> <p>Comedy is subjective, of course, but I didn’t find the jokes in this novel very funny. A skit about dogs doing Google searches fell flat. I groaned at many behind-the-scenes barbs among the comedy writers, such as Danny’s: “It’s very demeaning that you think my vagina needs cleaning. It shouldn’t smell floral when I’m getting oral.”</p> <p>And while <em>Romantic Comedy</em> convinces readers of the connection between Sally and Noah, its characters and world often lack the texture of real life. Noah, repeatedly referred to as “cheesily handsome”, often reads more like a cipher than a real person. He once greets Sally with, “Those are great fancy shoes.” Danny and Annabel’s relationship is cliched even when it tries to draw us in: Danny loves to gaze into Annabel’s eyes on her bed with a million pillows “like in the fanciest hotel”. And Sittenfeld often uses bland descriptions that show us nothing. In the <em>TNO</em> boss’ office, people sit on “the surprisingly crappy furniture in the surprisingly unfancy space”.</p> <p>The pace crawls in the section set at <em>TNO</em>, which takes up nearly half the book. Sittenfeld comprehensively researched<em> Saturday Night Live</em>; unfortunately, the text is weighed down with mechanical detail about the running of the show. The prose comparatively springs in its absence after the action moves location halfway through.</p> <p>Further drafts may have moved this novel past the stage of being bogged in research. They might have sharpened the details and honed the comedy. But as it stands, <em>Romantic Comedy</em> feels like a promising sketch for a better novel.</p> <p><em><strong>Romantic Comedy</strong></em><strong> by </strong><strong>Curtis Sittenfeld is published by </strong><strong>Doubleday, $32.99.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jo Case is deputy books and ideas editor for <em>The Conversation</em>.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.
