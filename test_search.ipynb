       "  'headline': 'Cue the sun: How The Truman Show predicted our obsession with fake reality',\n",
       "  'description': '<p>It was a Hollywood movie that forecast the rise of reality television. A sharp social satire-cum-touching fable that introduced such memorable phrases into popular culture as “cue the sun” and, “In case I don’t see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night.”</p> <p>Opening to glowing reviews in June 1998, Peter Weir’s <em>The Truman Show</em> became a hit that was later nominated for best director, original screenplay and supporting actor at the Oscars.</p> <p>Jim Carrey played Truman Burbank, a cheerful everyman who gradually discovers he is being filmed for what Paramount Pictures at the time called “a non-stop, 24 hour-a-day documentary soap opera”.</p> <p>Creator Christof (Ed Harris) built a show around a baby selected from an unwanted pregnancy. By the time Truman was an adult, it had become a worldwide hit, with 5000 hidden cameras capturing his interactions with family, friends, work colleagues and bystanders – all actors – on idyllic Seahaven Island.</p> <p>Twenty-five years on, <em>The Truman Show</em> remains such an inventive and visionary film that it’s a surprise to learn from Weir that the setting was inspired by the Australian soapie <em>Home and Away</em>.</p> <p>When the Australian director of <em>Gallipoli</em>, <em>Witness</em> and<em> Dead Poets Society</em> first read Andrew Niccol’s script in 1995, he thought it was “a startlingly original idea” with dark Orwellian overtones. But Weir turned down directing the film because “I just didn’t believe it”.</p> <p>In that version of the script, Truman had a drinking problem and was cheating on his wife in a replica of New York that had been built, like Seahaven Island, in a sound stage under a dome.</p> <p>“Truman, the unwitting star from birth, was a wreck of a man – full of anger, deeply depressed,” Weir says. “It wasn’t credible that people, ordinary folks, would have tuned in for 30 years to this gloomy world.</p> <p>“But as the days passed, I found I couldn’t get it off my mind. I called my agent back. If I had a free hand to rework it, I was in.”</p> <p>Weir, who briefly came out of retirement on Sydney’s northern beaches to accept an honorary Oscar late last year, worked with Niccol to “let some light in” and change Truman’s character.</p> <p>“In those early meetings, I talked about <em>Home and Away</em>, the TV series filmed in a beachside community not far from home,” he says. “The setting was idealised and it always seemed to be summer in Summer Bay. This became something of an inspiration for the change of setting from New York to Seahaven Island.”</p> <p>As Paramount’s use of the phrase “documentary soap opera” suggested, reality television was not yet a thing when <em>The Truman Show</em> reached cinemas.</p> <p>While the first stirrings included the ABC-BBC series <em>Sylvania Waters </em>and the Dutch <em>Nummer 28 </em>in the early 1990s, Niccol wrote his script before MTV filmed a group of young adults living in a new city for <em>The Real World</em>, which is credited with launching reality TV in 1992.</p> <p>It was not until a year after <em>The Truman Show</em> reached cinemas that the first season of <em>Big Brother</em> took the genre mainstream. There have now been 504 seasons in 62 versions around the world.</p> <p>Weir remembers reading that <em>Big Brother’s</em> creator John de Mol Jr realised he had better get cracking when the movie was released. “The tsunami of reality TV was just below the horizon,” <em>The Truman Show</em> director says.</p> <p>That tsunami has ordinary people – much more aware of what’s taking place than Truman – at the centre of countless reality formats, from cooking to competing in extreme environments.</p> <p>Renovators build, singers turn chairs, agents sell homes, singles seek partners, young models and drag queens chase careers, budding tycoons devise business ideas, real housewives and Kardashians concoct dramas, hobbyists assemble Lego.</p> <p>On a more fragmented scale, influencers have lucrative careers filming versions of their own personal reality shows for Instagram or TikTok.</p> <p>The head of unscripted at entertainment company Fremantle, Josie Mason Campbell, has worked on such reality shows as <em>Australia’s Next Top Model</em>, <em>The Biggest Loser</em>, <em>My Restaurant Rules</em>, <em>Old People’s Home For 4 Year Olds</em> and <em>Love On The Spectrum</em>.</p> <p>“When you look at the rise of reality TV, it’s because we like real people,” she says. “We like seeing ourselves reflected on screen.”</p> <p>Mason Campbell thinks the Prime Video show <em>Jury Duty</em>, which follows an unsuspecting man and 11 actors on a jury, shows how close the format has come to <em>The Truman Show,</em> though only for a three-week trial.</p> <p>No one involved expected the movie to be so hauntingly prophetic.</p> <p>“We would laugh about how unrealistic some of it seemed,” Laura Linney, who plays Truman’s stage wife Meryl, told <em>Vanity Fair</em> in 2018.</p> <p>Niccol, who has gone on to write and direct the films <em>Gattaca</em>, <em>S1m0ne</em> and <em>The Host</em>, described Truman at the time as the only genuine reality star because “when you know there is a camera, there is no reality”.</p> <p>Weir thinks <em>The Truman Show</em> could still work if it was made now.</p> <p>“There are plenty of reality shows out there but none have dared adopt an orphaned baby and raise it on hidden cameras,” he says. “So it’s still ahead of the game.”</p> <p>But the director has heard of one case of the movie influencing real life.</p> <p>“There was a retirement home in Germany where they created a sort of Seahaven with shops, houses, a main street, actors playing shopkeepers, a postman etcetera,” he says. “The retirees lived in a nice, clean, safe environment where everyone was friendly and happy.”</p> <p>One of the myths about the movie is that when the producers had to sack Dennis Hopper, who had been cast as Christof but couldn’t remember his lines, Weir wanted to take over the role. The story goes that the studio rejected the idea before Harris was cast and went on to get an Oscar nomination.</p> <p>Weir says he never thought of taking over the role.</p> <p>“I was fascinated by Christof, the creator of the show, but never considered playing the part,” he says. “Probably a joke from me or Jim at the time.”</p> <p>Like <em>The Matrix</em>, another hit film from a year later about someone who discovers they are living in a simulated reality, <em>The Truman Show</em> has been pored over for philosophical, political, religious and other meanings.</p> <p>One obvious question stems from the fact the show’s creator, who has a Christ-like name, performs the apparent miracles of bringing Truman’s father back from the dead, directing the weather and commanding the sun to rise. So was the film meant as an allegory about how individuals need to see through the illusion of religion?</p> <p>“The script was littered with metaphors,” Weir says. “Some intended, some not. My maxim was ‘let sleeping metaphors lie’.</p> <p>“You can find all kinds of meanings from the religious to the political and much in between. On one level I enjoyed it as an escape story, but first Truman has to discover he’s a prisoner. It’s like a riddle: how can you be a prisoner and not know it? Answer: to be born in prison.</p> <p>“As Christof says, ‘We accept the reality with which we’re presented’.”</p> <p>The film was a turning point in Carrey’s career.</p> <p>When he accepted the role, the Canadian actor was already a star earning $US20 million a movie after the success of the 1994 comedies <em>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</em>, <em>The Mask</em> and <em>Dumb and Dumbe</em>r. But he has talked about how his life had changed, with paparazzi following him and then-wife Lauren Holly around, and wondering whether he should leave “the crowd-pleasing guy” behind for a more authentic life.</p> <p>He told <em>Vanity Fair</em> that he really did almost drown in the climatic scene when Truman sets sail on his escape. It was shot in a Universal Studios tank with multiple safety precautions, but giant wave machines created such huge waves that Carrey, wearing a heavy woollen sweater, barely escaped from the bottom of the pool.</p> <p>Says Weir: “We thought we had the safety aspects covered for filming in the vast tank but, in all the froth and waves stirred to life by the wind machines, the scuba divers momentarily lost sight of Jim during one take and he was in trouble. He could have drowned. Sobering to say the least.”</p> <p>When he last watched the movie, on free-to-air TV two or three years ago, Weir was surprised by the commercials.</p> <p>“They usually destroy a film’s rhythm but in this case they actually seemed to be part of <em>The Truman Show</em> itself,” he says. “There’s already product placement within the show and the commercials just seemed part of all that.” </p> <p><strong><em>Email Garry Maddox at <a href=\"mailto:gmaddox@smh.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">gmaddox@smh.com.au</a> and follow him on Twitter at <a href=\"mailto:gmaddox@smh.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">gmaddox@smh.com.au</a>.</em></strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b style=\"font-size: 1.125rem\"><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p><strong>Spoiler Alert </strong>★★★½<br/><strong>M, 112 minutes</strong></p> <p>The title of Michael Ausiello’s bestselling memoir, <em>Spoiler Alert: The Hero Dies</em>, mixes irony and bravado in equal measure.</p> <p>Ausiello says his book isn’t a “misery memoir”. Even though the plot hinges on a diagnosis of terminal cancer, fun and romance have equally important parts to play.</p> <p>Michael Showalter’s film of the book drops the spoiler from the title, but we learn the worst in the opening scene. Then we’re into a flashback recounting what is essentially a love story. It begins in 2001 when Ausiello (Jim Parsons) and Kit Cowan (British actor Ben Aldridge) meet at a Manhattan club.</p> <p>They’re an unlikely pair. Kit is a buff, charming photographer who has always preferred casual sex to steady relationships, and Michael (Jim Parsons) is a nerdy vegetarian who drinks Diet Coke and wears button-down shirts buttoned up. He’s an entertainment journalist with a special interest in sitcoms and soaps. And that’s not all. When Kit is finally permitted to visit his apartment, he finds that it’s been colonised by the Smurf collection Ausiello has been acquiring since childhood.</p> <p>Ausiello wrote the book after Kit’s death. It grew from a series of Facebook posts read by the couple’s family and friends, one of whom was an editor at Simon &amp; Schuster. And Showalter has succeeded in catching its spirit – its intimacy, its self-deprecating sense of humour and Ausiello’s habit of seeing life through the prism of the television shows he loved as a kid. Both his parents died when he was young and the shows take him back to the times when he was at his happiest. So, too, does the Smurf collection.</p> <p>Kit’s parents are very much alive. His mother, Marilyn (Sally Field) competes in triathlons – despite her stately pace and dodgy knees – and his father, Bob (Bill Irwin) is kept busy carrying out his wife’s orders. Kit’s relationship with Michael finally gives him the courage to tell them that he’s gay and they do better than approve. They embrace Michael as a surrogate son.</p> <p>The film is episodic in shape. The couple go through many ups and downs during the 13 years they spend together and the script canvasses them all. Sometimes the tone is a little too cute but Showalter (<em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em>) and his writers have a persuasive ability to defuse the looming threat of sentimentality with comedy.</p> <p>Aldridge is terrific as the easy-going Kit, who’s been blessed with such physical confidence that the disease comes as both shock and betrayal, and Field knows exactly when to rein in the indomitable Marilyn. It’s a disarming film.</p> <p><strong><em>Spoiler Alert</em> is in cinemas from February 9.</strong></p> <p><b><i>A cultural guide to going out and loving your city. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=culture-fix\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up to our Culture Fix newsletter here</a></i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'headline': 'How a bizarre outback murder case put Larrimah, population 11, on the map',\n",
       "  'description': '<p>When director Thomas Tancred walked into the office of Duplass Brothers Productions with his pitch for a true-crime documentary set in a tiny town in the Australian outback, Mark Duplass was immediately hooked.</p> <p>“I was like, ‘Well, f---, this is really exciting’,” says the actor-writer-producer-director and champion, with brother Jay, of the branch of lo-fi indie filmmaking known (both derisively and appreciatively) as mumblecore. “I’d been thinking this whole true-crime thing is really interesting but it’s getting a bit one-note, and then this thing walked into our office.”</p> <p>This thing was the story of the disappearance, and presumed murder, of 70-year-old Paddy Moriarty in 2017. In an isolated town in the Northern Territory with a population of just 11, originally everyone was a suspect.</p> <p>Tancred had come across the case while scrolling Twitter. “I think it was a headline of, ‘Population 11. One goes missing.’ And I really knew there was something there when I went on YouTube and saw some of the residents. I thought those are great characters.”</p> <p>Duplass saw the project as “a combination of two really disparate but seemingly interesting things – a true-crime documentary series and a Christopher Guest film”. (Guest’s movies, including <i>Waiting For Guffman</i> and <i>Best in Show</i>, are mockumentaries about small communities of oddball characters who are utterly unaware of their oddness.)</p> <p>Hot off an Emmy win for the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh documentary series <i>Wild Wild Country</i> in 2018, Duplass thought it would be a breeze to sell the idea to a broadcaster.</p> <p>“I told Thomas, ‘I’m gonna sell this thing in, like, two days; this is going to be explosive’. And I was totally wrong. I took this project all over town – and every single studio passed on it.”</p> <p>Five years later, though, he and Tancred have finally been vindicated. <i>Last Stop Larrimah</i> is a hit.</p> <p>Eventually picked up by HBO’s streaming platform Max in the US (as a feature film), it is on Netflix in Australia and a bunch of other territories as a two-part series, where it has been a top 10 title since debuting two weeks ago.</p> <p><i>Larrimah</i> has sparked fascinated chatter online and in the real world, with people who have watched the tragicomedy unfurl on screen sharing and debating theories about what happened to Paddy, who was responsible, and why.</p> <p>One of the most far-fetched theories is that a neighbour paid to have him murdered (the motive being a long-running dispute over nothing much at all), then disposed of his body by chopping it up and cooking it for the “famous” meat pies she sold at her eccentric stopover cafe, where every customer received a soft plushy toy when they paid up. The neighbour in the series strongly denies the accusations.</p> <p>Duplass knew the show had truly resonated, he says, when his house was swarmed at Halloween by trick-or-treaters. “As the parents came through with their kids, it wasn’t like, ‘Oh, I recognise you from <i>The Morning Show</i>’,” he says. “It was, like, ‘Dude, the f---ing meat pies, man’.”</p> <p>The way the show has been embraced is especially pleasing for Tancred in light of how difficult it was to make.</p> <p>Before he’d shot a frame, he spent seven or eight months trying to woo the residents to participate, without any luck. “One night, as I was close to giving up, I just randomly called the pub and got Barry Sharpe, the publican,” he says. “He very kindly said no, and then we talked for 10 or 15 more minutes, and at the end he said, ‘F--- it.

       "  'description': '<p>It’s practically impossible to see Meg Ryan and not think about Nora Ephron. By the time Ryan starred in <em>You’ve Got Mail</em> (1998) – her third film either written or directed by Ephron – the two were officially a package deal.<strong></strong></p> <p>That’s why all I could think about when I saw Ryan had made a new film, <em>What Happens Later</em>, was the late, Oscar-nominated screenwriter. Ephron, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/nora-ephron-dies-aged-71-20120627-211dv.html\" target=\"_blank\">who died in 2012</a>, revolutionised the romantic-comedy genre, highlighting not only strong female characters but also their sexuality (we all <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/nora-ephron-dies-aged-71-20120627-211dv.html\" target=\"_blank\">who died in 2012</a> now).</p> <p>Where Ephron goes, the holy trinity follows: <em>When Harry Met Sally </em>(1989), <em>Sleepless in Seattle </em>(1993) and <em>You’ve Got Mail</em>. We romcom lovers collectively recite the Katz’s Delicatessen fake-orgasm scene word-for-word, we worship the ground Tom Hanks walks on (in either film, take your pick) and we give thanks to how far we’ve come since ye olde email.</p> <p>But has our devotion to this sentimental triad overshadowed Ephron’s other gems … or nuts?</p> <p>That’s right, I’m talking about <em>Mixed Nuts, </em>Ephron’s 1994 dark-comedy Christmas film. Based on the 1982 French film <em>Le pere Noel est une ordure</em> (<em>Santa Claus Is a Stinker</em>)<em>, </em>Ephron’s take is set in Venice Beach, Los Angeles, on Christmas Eve. It follows a ragtag group of misfits, including the frazzled operators of a crisis helpline, as everything – and I mean <em>everything</em> – goes wrong around them. The disgruntled, widowed employee Mrs Munchnik (Madeline Kahn) gets trapped in an elevator, the milksop leader Philip (Steve Martin) is brutally broken up with over the phone, and they’re all getting evicted from their office space. What a holly jolly Christmas.</p> <p>Audiences and critics at the time seemed to have an allergic reaction to <em>Mixed Nuts</em>. The <em>Chicago Sun-Times’ </em>Roger Ebert gave it a dismal <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mixed-nuts-1994\" target=\"_blank\">1½ stars</a>, comparing it to “smiling politely for hours in the enforced company of strangers, madmen and bores”. <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mixed-nuts-1994\" target=\"_blank\">1½ stars</a> said Ephron displayed “the comedic equivalent of two left feet”. Basically, it flopped.</p> <p>Admittedly, I don’t think 1994 audiences were ready for <em>Mixed Nuts</em>. They were too wrapped up watching Arnold Schwarzenegger save Jamie Lee Curtis while dangling off a helicopter in <em>True Lies, </em>or Schwarzenegger becoming the first man to give birth in<em> Junior</em> (what a year for Arnie). They wanted their action hardcore and their comedy ridiculous. The fatalistic farce that is <em>Mixed Nuts</em> was evidently just too bleak for the sugary cinema of the mid-’90s.</p> <p>For 2023, on the other hand, it’s arguably perfect. These days, cinema operates less as a salve against the pain of reality and more as a reminder that life can sometimes feel like a cruel joke – but it’s a cruel joke worth living. That may sound depressing but it offers a strange form of solidarity, reiterating that we’re not alone in our struggles. After all, the TikTok age is all about authenticity and truth, is it not? We don’t want to be pandered to.</p> <p>“In every pothole there is hope,” Philip says at one point, before explaining how his father had said the same thing before being run over by a truck carrying mixed nuts. It’s hilariously horrible, summarising the delicious nihilism of the entire film.</p> <p>Not only was its tone ahead of its time but so was its talent. The cast could be mistaken for a carefully curated <em>Saturday Night Live</em> episode, with standout performances from Martin, Wilson, Juliette Lewis, Rob Reiner, Parker Posey, Anthony LaPaglia and a <em>Billy Madison-</em>era Adam Sandler.</p> <p>The real show-stealer, however, is Liev Schreiber (<em>Asteroid City</em>), whose deft performance as the lonely transgender woman Chris became his film debut. In what would otherwise have been a rather insensitive portrayal of a trans person – namely, the unseemly attempt at visual comedy by casting a noticeably tall, broad-shouldered man, and the initial discomfort most characters greet Chris with – Schreiber imbues his character with more tenderness and humanity than any other on-screen. The serenading scene between Schreiber and Sandler, who plays the loveable downstairs neighbour, is particularly touching – a moment of acceptance and empathy amid what’s otherwise a frenzy of mishaps.</p> <p>Of course, some elements of the film cannot be as easily defended. One scene – in which a depressed person, played by comedian Steven Wright, shoots himself as a result of technical difficulties with the Life Savers phone line – leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and the ending returns to the sugary yuletide sentimentality that most of the film strives to dismantle. But for a film made nearly three decades ago, it arguably remains remarkably relevant.</p> <p>Sure, none of its one-liners survived the test of time (though I would argue that “my psychiatrist thinks we should break up” could easily become a Gen Z anthem), making it almost impossible to live up to often-quoted behemoths like <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>. But, for what it’s worth, while everyone else repeats lines like, “Waiter, there is too much pepper on my paprikash”, I’ll be ironically reciting, “if you don’t have tits like Dolly Parton, no one wants you”.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p><strong>You Hurt My Feelings ★★★★</strong><br/><strong>(MA) 93 minutes</strong></p> <p>Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ athletic comic rhythm of pushiness followed by self-doubt hasn’t shifted much since her <em>Seinfeld</em> days. But in the right context her reflexes are as sharp as ever, as she shows in Nicole Holofcener’s expertly funny <em>You Hurt My Feelings</em>, which tackles many topics that might easily have been debated by the <em>Seinfeld</em> gang: when you should throw out your underwear, for instance, or the etiquette of sharing an icecream cone.</p> <p>Also in the <em>Seinfeld</em> tradition is the attention given to the minutiae of language, especially in relation to status. Is it really a compliment if you tell someone they look “adorable”, or if you describe a literary work as “pleasing”?</p> <p>Such nuances loom especially large for Louis-Dreyfus’ character Beth, a New York writing teacher who has just finished her first novel (a follow-up to her moderately successful memoir <em>I Had To Tell It</em>, which recounts her traumatic childhood history of “verbal abuse”).</p> <p>Her husband Don (Tobias Menzies) has supported her through draft after draft – but, as she discovers through an overheard conversation, the enthusiasm he expresses to her face may not be entirely genuine.</p> <p>Don, who works as a therapist, has comparable reason for unease in his own professional domain, as do Beth’s sister Sarah (Michaela Watkins) and Sarah’s husband Mark (Arian Moayed), an interior decorator and an actor respectively.</p> <p>Indeed, just about every scene in <em>You Hurt My Feelings</em> offers a new variation on the theme, with one or more of these characters forced to make the awful choice between kindness and honesty, wondering how far they’re being politely lied to in turn, or facing the challenge of dealing with negative feedback when it arrives.</p> <p>Seemingly less prone to such anxieties is Beth and Sarah’s caustic mother Georgia (the great Jeannie Berlin) whose bluntness gives a sense of where at least some of her daughters’ neuroses might have sprung from.</p> <p>As in Holofcener’s earlier comedies of manners such as <em>Friends With Money</em>, the approach here is slightly abstracted but never too heightened: the terrific actors have all come to play, but their characters aren’t reduced to pure sitcom types.</p> <p>Don’s sessions with his patients are portrayed with some realism – refreshingly, he appears to be neither great at his job nor terrible – and unlike on <em>Seinfeld</em> everyone is allowed at least the possibility of genuine psychological growth, though it’s always a matter of small steps rather than big leaps.</p> <p>To use another dubious term of praise, it’s all highly relatable, however distant you might feel from this particular social circle of well-off New Yorkers. Holofcener knows as well as anyone around how to make us cringe and laugh by turns, or simultaneously – and I’m not just saying that.</p> <p><strong><em>You Hurt My Feelings</em> is in cinemas from June 15.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'headline': 'How Patricia Field ‘reunited’ Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall',\n",
       "  'description': '<p>Fashion can be a unifying force. Want proof? Patricia Field, the veteran film and television costume director, arguably most famous for her work on <em>Sex and the City</em>, managed to do what Hollywood could not – bring feuding actresses Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall to the same screen.</p> <p>Both stars of <em>Sex and the City</em> appear in a new biopic, <em>Happy Clothes: A Film About Patricia Field</em>, with several scenes showing Cattrall and Field cavorting around Manhattan.</p> <p>The two became close during <em>SATC</em> and Field now works on Cattrall’s latest show, <em>Glamorous</em>, in which she plays a supermodel turned beauty mogul – a kind of <em>Devil Wears Prada</em> (another credit that earned Field an Oscar nomination) meets the cosmetics industry.</p> <p>So strong is the bond between the women that Cattrall only agreed to make a cameo on <em>Sex and the City</em> sequel <em>And Just Like That </em>if Field dressed her (Field turned down <em>AJLT</em> due to scheduling clashes with filming for <em>Emily in Paris; </em>the show’s costumes are directed by Molly Rogers, Field’s right hand on <em>SATC</em>, and Danny Santiago).</p> <p>Field, 81, says via Zoom that she had been approached numerous times over the years about making a documentary, but it wasn’t until director Michael Selditch ambushed her with a “sizzle reel” that she agreed. Fame, she says in an early scene in <em>Happy Clothes,</em> doesn’t sit naturally with her.</p> <p>“I’m in over my head. All of a sudden, I became this famous person. I worked, and enjoyed the work, for years but, somehow, recognition found me and in a certain way, I’m a little nervous about it,” she says while puffing on a cigarette – a Field trademark as ubiquitous as her cherry red hair and thick-rimmed glasses.</p> <p>The film’s title is a direct quote from Field, a self-described “exaggeration queen” who often pairs seemingly incongruous combinations on screen – clashing colours, prints and silhouettes – to create a surprising seamlessness.</p> <p>It’s how one of <em>SATC’s</em> most famous outfits – Parker, as Carrie Bradshaw, wearing a tutu on the streets of Manhattan in the opening credits – came to be, even if the show’s creator, Darren Star, didn’t fully comprehend it at first.</p> <p>“I said, ‘You know, Darren, this is not something trendy, this is something that will last forever, and stay fresh’,” Field says.</p> <p>And it worked. Fans of the show still buy $US140 ($210) replicas of the tutu – Parker has the original – from Field’s gallery in Lower Manhattan, a more sedate space than the store she ran for nearly 50 years, which in the 1980s was a hangout for artists, club kids and future celebrities, including RuPaul and Laverne Cox (John F. Kennedy Jr was reportedly barred once for making anti-trans slurs about the patrons).</p> <p>It was also where a young Selditch spent time, but it was only while making the 2019 documentary <em>American Style</em> that he zeroed on in on Field as a documentary subject.</p> <p>The film’s opening scene, which shows Field swimming in a pool covered in tiled mosaics, was designed to surprise. “I wanted people to be in the theatre wondering, ‘Am I in the right [movie]?’” he says.</p> <p>“Yeah, maybe they would anticipate the opening scene would be, like, at a fashion show,” Field adds.</p> <p>Instead, <em>Happy Clothes</em> takes the viewer inside Field’s “process”, scouring vintage fairs for <em>tchotchkes</em>, and to fittings with the cast of <em>Run the World</em>, billed as an all-black <em>SATC</em>. Through these snippets, we’re given a taste of some of Field’s mantras – “As long as the colours match, you can f–k around with the patterns” – and her views on modern style.</p> <p>“Today the fashion is so depressing,” she says in the film, later explaining she has grown bored by the overwhelming uniformity of dressing.</p> <p>“What I call ‘depression wear’ fashion, as opposed to ‘celebratory fashion’ ... Fashion definitely is a reflection of the time that we are living in,” she says.</p> <p>“I use the example of the 1920s – people were celebratory ... These days it’s more, I don’t know why, but maybe people feel getting overdressed isn’t cool.”</p> <p>For Field, there ain’t no such thing.</p> <p><em><strong>Happy Clothes: A Film About Patricia Field</strong></em><strong> screens at the Melbourne International Film Festival on August 5, 7 and 19. miff.com.au. <em>The Age</em> is a festival media partner.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Make the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our</i></b><b><i> Live Well newsletter</i></b><b><i>. </i></b><b><i>Get it in your inbox every Monday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p>For television historians amateur and professional, the easiest place to begin the story of the contemporary Golden Age of Television is on January 10, 1999, when Tony Soprano first paid a toll on the New Jersey Turnpike. But perhaps we might be better served to rewind the clock approximately six years, to January 31, 1993, the premiere of a new NBC drama, set in Baltimore, studying the work of the city’s homicide detectives.</p> <p>The series was called <em>Homicide: Life on the Street</em>, and it was based on a book by David Simon, then a Baltimore <em>Sun</em> reporter who had spent a year tagging along with the police department’s homicide squad. <em>Homicide</em> was never a ratings success, but it stayed on the air for seven seasons, winning four Emmys and three Peabody Awards. The show was prickly, funny, morally forceful, endlessly discursive and filled with a murderers’ row of actors, including future stars Andre Braugher (who won an Emmy for his performance as Frank Pembleton), Melissa Leo and Giancarlo Esposito, along with veterans like Ned Beatty, Yaphet Kotto and Richard Belzer, known primarily then as a stand-up comedian.</p> <p>The show’s sixth episode, <em>Three Men and Adena</em>, which first aired in March, was a stark, dramatic example of what made <em>Homicide</em> different from other cop shows. It takes place almost entirely within the confines of an interrogation room, with detectives Pembleton and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) attempting to wring a confession out of Risley Tucker (Moses Gunn), an itinerant fruit-and-vegetable man, after the murder of a little girl named Adena Watson. Pembleton and Bayliss prod, provoke and rage, but <em>Homicide</em> refuses to grant the audience the resolution they crave. Tucker doesn’t crack. Adena’s case is never solved. (The showrunner, Tom Fontana, won an Emmy for writing the episode.)</p> <p>Thirty years later, Fontana, executive producers Barry Levinson and Paul Attanasio and actors Braugher and Secor reflected on <em>Three Men and Adena</em>, in particular, and on the broader legacy of the series and their frustration at its still not being available to stream. These are edited excerpts from conversations with them.</p> <p>After Levinson, a Baltimore native known for setting films like <em>Diner</em> and <em>Avalon</em> in the city, read Simon’s book, he knew he wanted to adapt it. But he thought TV would be a better venue. He hired Attanasio to create the series and write the pilot, and he eventually brought in Fontana to run the show.</p> <p>TOM FONTANA: I said, “I’m not really sure I want to do a cop show.” And Levinson said: “This is about the homicide detectives. They’re thinking cops. There’s no gunbattles, there’s no car chases.” And I said: “That’s impossible. I’ll do it.”</p> <p>BARRY LEVINSON: I thought it ought to be done completely in Baltimore. We can do it really down and dirty and lean. Instead of shooting 35-millimeter film, we’ll shoot in Super 16 and with hand-held cameras.</p> <p>FONTANA: I think I’ve read David’s book more times than I’ve read any other book in my life. By the time we were done, we’d used everything in the book, including the commas and question marks.</p> <p>PAUL ATTANASIO: I built Frank Pembleton out of the idea of a character who didn’t want a partner. And then Kyle’s character, Bayliss, was a more functional, more conventional television character who was the rookie, so you could use him as a guide to bring you into the show.</p> <p>FONTANA: Our premiere was after the Super Bowl. NBC was very jazzed about that. I said to Barry: “After the Super Bowl, everybody’s drunk! This isn’t a show you can watch drunk.”</p> <p>ANDRE BRAUGHER: The first year, there was a sort of Jean-Luc Godard jump-cut sensibility that we enjoyed.</p> <p>FONTANA: I said to Barry, “You know, I’d love to write an episode that basically only takes place in the interrogation room.” And he said: “Let’s just try it. Let’s try everything.”</p> <p>KYLE SECOR: I went in and met them. Within a couple minutes, they said, “The sixth episode we’re going to do, it’s just going to be three guys in an interrogation room. It’ll be you, your partner and this other character.” And I went, “Oh, well, I’m in.”</p> <p>FONTANA: The real girl who was murdered in Baltimore, that the Adena Watson story was based on, her murder was never solved. I made a decision that we would never solve the murder on the show because we felt like it would be disrespectful to the family and to the young girl’s memory.</p> <p>SECOR: We had rehearsals before shooting, which was a comfort. Andre and I had spent a lot of time in that room, and it felt like that was our room. We had control of that room.</p> <p>BRAUGHER: We performed it like a theatre piece. There’s nowhere to go. It’s a strangely shaped little room with a door and a window. So it’s just three men going around and around and around again.</p> <p>FONTANA: We are asking the audience to watch this hour of intense interrogation and then not give them the solution they were hoping for. That was satisfying for me as well, because I didn’t want it to be all neat and tidy at the end.</p> <p>ATTANASIO: I think what’s really brilliant about that script is, it’s one thing to say you’re not to give the audience what they’re looking for. But then the question is, what are you going to give them? And what Tom gave them was heartbreak. And irresolution.</p> <p>FONTANA: I knew the rhythms of Andre and Secor. And I knew that it had to have twists and turns, and that eventually, Tucker would start indicting them. I knew going in that was the way it would travel.</p> <p>ATTANASIO: It’s not just good like bran cereal is good for you. It’s electrifying. You can’t take your eyes off it. And all it is, is three actors in a room.</p> <p>BRAUGHER: It’s the most fun I’ve had filming an episode. It was physically hard, it was emotionally taxing, but it was very satisfying.</p> <p>At the end of the episode, Bayliss takes the photograph of Adena from the interrogation room and places it on his desk, where it remains for multiple seasons.</p> <p>SECOR: When I met Tom Pellegrini, who was the detective that I was based on, I got Bayliss immediately as someone where being unable to solve this case affected his entire life. Affected his marriage, affected relationships, affected his job, affected how he saw his work, everything.</p> <p>FONTANA: If you’re going to track a character over the life of a series, you need to see the stuff that he or she accumulates. There was an episode where he puts the picture in a drawer. He was sort of like, “I have to get past this now.”</p> <p>BRAUGHER: That’s one of the beautiful things about the episode. It doesn’t resolve in favour of our heroes. The moral frustration in the entire series is that Adena Watson’s murder is never solved.</p> <p>FONTANA: My career has been an endless number of shows that I’m proud of that never were in the Top 10, starting with <em>St. Elsewhere</em>.</p> <p>ATTANASIO: Don Ohlmeyer (then NBC’s West Coast president) loved the show, as long as they could make it for a reasonable amount of money.</p> <p>BRAUGHER: When I think back to that initial group, that first- and second-year group, it was a wonderful cast and boy, were we quirky. Boy, were we misfits, and I loved it.</p> <p>LEVINSON: For the last four years, I’ve tried to get an answer for why we’re not on streaming. No one, I mean no one, has been able to give me an answer. There’s money to be made. You can’t figure out how to handle whatever rights issues that may come up? You’re talking over 120-some[thing] episodes. And somehow no one can figure out how to handle the rights? That doesn’t make sense!</p> <p>SECOR: Who knows? Maybe we’ll start streaming on Netflix!</p> <p>This article originally appeared in The New York Times.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/arts/television/homicide-life-on-the-street.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p>With big-name releases like Joel Kim Booster’s <i>Fire Island </i>and Billy Eichner’s <i>Fire Island </i>, 2022 was widely celebrated as <i>Fire Island </i>. But after watching the latter film just two months before the release of his own gay love story <i>Spoiler Alert</i>, English actor Ben Aldridge admits he had “a knot in [his] stomach.”</p> <p>“I enjoyed it,” he says. “I laughed a lot. But <i>Bros </i>was really scrutinised by the industry and a lot of the [LGBTQ] community too. I sat there and just felt like… ‘we’re next out of the gate’.”</p> <p><i>Spoiler Alert</i>, which has just hit Australian cinemas, is a very different film to <i>Bros</i>.</p> <p>Instead of eliciting big laughs about Grindr and group sex, it’s more likely to make you cry. Eichner’s film had an aggressive marketing campaign as “the first gay romcom by a major film studio” – a sell that some queer audiences felt erased previous titles, and ultimately didn’t drive ticket sales, big laughs about Grindr and group sex<em> Spoiler Alert</em> is instead eager to position itself as a universal story.</p> <p>“This is a love story first,” says Aldridge’s co-star Jim Parsons. “And then it’s a gay love story ... There was no effort to explain gay life to people in this. It’s just an accepted fact.”</p> <p>The film, adapted from the 2017 memoir <i>Spoiler Alert: The Hero Dies </i>and co-scripted by love and sex columnist Dan Savage, tells the true story of TV journalist Michael Ausiello’s relationship with his husband Kit Cowan (played by Aldridge) – and Kit’s eventual death from cancer.</p> <p>“They go through a similar thing to the characters of <em>Terms of Endearment</em>,” Parsons (who plays Michael) says. “A journey through cancer allows them to cut through the bullshit. They realise how much time can get wasted on these little things that make you angry or jealous or whatever.”</p> <p>Though very sweet, it’s also a traumatic story – and Aldridge had flickers of fear about how the film would be received by queer audiences who are “quite policing of our stories at the moment”. This includes a broad aversion to tragedies after decades of limited representation in cinema that usually revolved around HIV, discrimination, and pain.</p> <p>“But what I want to do is reflect real life and reflect us as a community in a real way,” he says. “We’re not immune to tragedy. We’re not immune to cancer. That’s part of our life – just like we’re not immune to love.”</p> <p>This is a particularly exciting endeavour for Aldridge, after publicly coming out as gay in 2020. Though he was previously best known for playing straight alpha males – most notably the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRuSDZkhO-M\" target=\"_blank\">“arsehole guy” in Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRuSDZkhO-M\" target=\"_blank\">“arsehole guy” in Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s </a> – </em>he’s spent the past few years almost exclusively exploring queer characters.</p> <p>Aldridge also plays a gay dad alongside Broadway star Jonathan Groff in M. Night Shyamalan’s new film <em>Knock at the Cabin</em>. </p> <p>“I think I came out publicly partly because of a certain idea I had of the way I was being perceived [through my earlier roles] ... I did it despite the impact it might have. Because at the time I felt that it could negatively impact my career.</p> <p>“Rupert Everett famously said coming out completely sabotaged his career. I had a lot of fear around it. And I think there’s still fear for some actors who are playing ‘alpha’ roles in Hollywood – people who still worry or are still very private about it.”</p> <p>Best known as neurotic physicist Sheldon Cooper from <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, which ended in 2019 as the longest-running multi-camera sitcom in US history, Parsons is also exploring new terrain in this film.</p> <p>“I played 12 years of a character who had trouble connecting to people at an emotional level,” he says. “And I don’t know how much I was conscious of this at the time, but I was so eager and excited to be a part of this [story because of the] intensely deep connection that these two men have to each other.”</p> <p>“In some ways, it really felt like a relief. It felt like a part of me was able to breathe in a way that hadn’t for a while.”</p> <p>Though Parsons isn’t actively seeking out queer characters, he says he does “undeniably see the rewards from having done [a role like this] and from seeing people’s reaction to it”.</p> <p>“I feel like the most common response from the community has been a sense of joy at seeing a gay couple portrayed in such a realistic way – both in the complications of their relationship, and going through the machinations of what it is to be alive for anybody.”</p> <p>This is something we wouldn’t have seen in the industry even 10 years ago, he says.</p> <p>And it’s something Parsons wouldn’t have been talking about either. Though it became public knowledge he was gay in 2012, when he made an offhand comment to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/theater/jim-parsons-prepares-for-his-lead-role-in-harvey.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, the actor has since spoken about how he “made it [his] mission not to talk about it”.</p> <p>“I wasn’t scared to the point of denying my sexuality,” he recently told <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/how-i-came-hollywood-a-decade-by-decade-oral-history-1296888/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>. “[But] I was scared that it might cause trouble, quote unquote, for our big television show.” </p> <p>“I can’t believe how much [the industry has] changed in 10 years,” Aldridge adds.</p> <p>“I would have never spoken about my sexuality in an audition room or with a director. I would have completely hidden that – and I was told that would be a helpful thing.”</p> <p>“I think what’s changed most is that there is room for us. We can exist. There’s representation, where there wasn’t any when I grew up.”</p> <p>And while there are ongoing questions about <a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-drop/rom-coms-are-back-so-we-ranked-our-top-five\" target=\"_blank\">the commercial viability of rom coms and romantic dramas on the big screen</a> – queer or otherwise – Aldridge would like to see as much “diverse and truthful” representation as possible.</p> <p>“I had these feelings that I was very uncomfortable with because I had nowhere to turn to see a positive example of what that might be.</p> <p>“I hope it’s very different for people growing up now.”</p> <p><b></b><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.</i></b><a href=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p>There were many culturally significant moments at the height of the #MeToo controversy in 2017. Harvey Weinstein was increasingly exposed as a predatory monster. Women around the world came forward with their own stories of sexual harassment and abuse that forced a reckoning on other powerful men. And <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/11/cat-person\" target=\"_blank\">a short story titled <em>Cat Person</em> that was published in <em>The New Yorker</em> </a>went viral.</p> <p>An unknown Michigan writer, Kristen Roupenian, sparked a heated debate about dating and gender relations with a cringeworthy romance between a young college student, Margot, who worked in an arty cinema and an awkward older man, Robert, she served at a concession stand. After a lot of texting and joking back and forth that promised a bright future, everything changed for Margot<b> </b>with an embarrassing sexual encounter.</p> <p>Six years on, Roupenian is still stunned by how the story took off.</p> <p>“It’s hard to really describe how unexpected it was,” she says on a Zoom call from her apartment. “It was absolutely surprising and confusing and occasionally terrifying. But also, I mean, amazing.”</p> <p>Then aged 36, Roupenian had been wondering whether she would ever make it as a writer, how she could keep paying her bills and whether buying an apartment was an impossible idea. Suddenly she had a $US1.2 million advance for her first book of short stories.</p> <p>“Lightning struck,” she says.</p> <p>Roupenian thinks anyone who read <em>Cat Person</em> in <em>The New Yorker</em> is probably better able to explain why it went viral than her.</p> <p>With the fraught political scene in the US during the Trump presidency and the ugly revelations about Weinstein, “it just felt like everyone was about to stop whatever they were doing and start screaming in the streets”, she says. “I feel like the story, which has a lot of submerged tension and frustration and anger in it, just caught that wave.”</p> <p>Now <em>Cat Person</em>, which has continued to affect Roupenian’s life in fascinating ways, has been adapted into a movie. And a surprising movie at that: giving the hellscape of modern dating a horror-thriller twist.</p> <p>Director Susanna Fogel (<em>The Spy Who Dumped Me</em>), who has cast Emilia Jones (<em>CODA</em>) and Nicholas Braun (<em>Succession</em>) as Margot and Robert, only read <em>Cat Person</em> when it went viral.</p> <p>“I’m one of those lapsed intellectuals who lets <em>The New Yorker</em> stacks get sky high before reading them all,” she says. “When I read it, I thought, wow, they should publish more stories like this in <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p> <p>“It’s about a young woman, it’s relatable and it feels so conversational that it’s not what you’d expect to read there. But then the conversation around it became so heated that the narrative almost became people’s reactions to the story as much as it was to the story itself.”</p> <p>Fogel thinks the story touched on something universal, which is that “we’ve been raised on these love stories but the reality of trying to engage with somebody, particularly in such a fraught, loaded time in culture and in conversations around gender and power, it’s almost impossible to relax and make an authentic connection”.</p> <p>She thought someone would turn <em>Cat Person</em> into a movie – “I live in Los Angeles and that’s what you think when you read anything compelling” – but was not sure how given it was such an internal and personal short story. But two years later, she read a script written by Michelle Ashford (<em>Masters of Sex</em>, <em>Operation Mincemeat</em>) that convinced her to get involved.</p> <p>“I saw that she’d really manifested all of that psychology in a really thrilling story where our main character is manifesting a lot of drama and horror in her own mind,” she says.</p> <p>The timing was right. After a batch of post #MeToo movies mostly about women standing up against sexual predators, including <em>Bombshell</em> in 2019, <em>Promising Young Woman</em> in 2020, and <em>She Said </em>and <em>Women Talking </em>last year, <em>Cat Person</em> moves beyond the issue of consent to examine what Fogel calls “a confusing muddy mess of an encounter”.</p> <p>She adds: “The next step in the conversation was ‘let’s talk about when it’s not so clear’. The truth is that Margot does give consent. She does say ‘yes’ but we don’t always know what we want and our partner doesn’t always know what we want either, particularly if we’re not saying it.”</p> <p>Fogel wants viewers to recognise their own behaviour in the movie and be inspired to behave more authentically in relationships. “I want people to see this movie and think, ‘Oh God, I relate to one or more of the characters. At my worst moments, I’ve been both of them’,” she says.</p> <p>After playing the only speaking member of a deaf family in <em>CODA</em>, Fogel says Jones was an easy choice to play Margot.</p> <p>“She has this incredible ability to convince you that she’s somebody that you could go to university with or would be in your group of friends even though she’s an actress,” she says. “She can really play an everygirl in this incredibly likable compelling way ... The minute [Margot] becomes either a manipulative pretty girl or a victim then it’s too easy [for the audience].”</p> <p>But gawky Cousin Greg from <em>Succession</em> is less obvious casting for Robert, except that the series’ huge success made every actor in it better known. “I wanted somebody for that role who men like,” Fogel says. “In a story like this, especially when there’s a genre element, it’s really easy to just dismiss somebody as a bad guy.</p> <p>“And Nick’s physicality is so specific. He’s so tall. If you’re a woman, unless you’re also six foot seven, you’re totally overshadowed and overpowered by a man of that size.</p> <p>“That’s just a visceral reality of women dating men. [But] Robert isn’t aware that he has that power. He doesn’t feel empowered in situations with women and that makes him feel really off balance and insecure and angry.”</p> <p>Australia’s Geraldine Viswanathan (<em>Bad Education</em>) has a key role as Margot’s feisty feminist best friend Taylor. “Geraldine is one of my favourite actors I’ve ever worked with and my favourite actors in general,” Fogel says. “I can’t believe how many things that girl can do: every accent, every emotion, so brilliantly funny.”</p> <p>Roupenian, who is now writing a novel, remembers telling producers “go with God” when they suggested <em>Cat Person</em> become a movie because she had no idea how to write it. But she thinks Ashford and Fogel have done an amazing job.</p> <p>“I can see that, oh, they’ve made their own cool thing that I can engage with on its own terms,” she says.</p> <p>Away from the movie, <em>Cat Person</em> keeps having an impact on Roupenian’s life.</p> <p>“Every once in a while, people want to have very intimate conversations with me because there is a kind of intimacy that happens when you read a story like that,” she says. “You feel like you know the writer.</p> <p>“But it’s hard for me to say both ‘I’m grateful for that, it’s a real part of me and the story has truth’ and ‘this isn’t me and I can’t be the person you’re probably imagining I am’. It’s strange.”</p> <p>Two years ago, <em>Cat Person</em> trended on Twitter, now X, again.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/07/cat-person-kristen-roupenian-viral-story-about-me.html\" target=\"_blank\">an article in <em>Slate magazine</em> called <em>Cat Person And Me</em></a>, Alexis Nowicki alleged Roupenian had appropriated details of her romance with an ex-boyfriend, who had since died, for the short story. Margot came from the same home town, lived in a dorm at the same college, worked in the same art-house theatre and dated an older man who had the same appearance, mannerisms, clothes and home.</p> <p>When Nowicki approached her before the article, Roupenian admitted to “an encounter” with the ex-boyfriend and that Nowicki’s social media served as a “jumping-off point” for a story that was primarily a work of the imagination that also drew on personal experience.</p> <p>“I can absolutely see why the inclusion of those details in the story would cause you significant pain and confusion, and I can’t tell you how sorry I am about that,” Roupenian wrote to her. “I hope it goes without saying that was never my intention, and I will do what I can to rectify any harm it caused.”</p> <p>That remains a painful episode for Roupenian.</p> <p>“After <em>Cat Person</em>, I’ll never see my name trending on Twitter and not feel a little bit of PTSD,” she says now. “If the last five years have taught me anything it’s you write what you write, you put it in the world, people are going to have their reactions to it and some of them will be negative.</p> <p>“Some part of you will want to jump out and be like, ‘no, no, no, you’re interpreting it wrong’ and that’s just not your job. I say what I say; Alexis was able to write her essay. Everybody’s out there, saying what feels true to them and you just have to let the rest of it go.”</p> <p>As well as launching a trend in Millennial fiction – Sally Rooney’s debut novel <em>Conversations With Friends</em> was also published in 2017 – there are other ways the story keeps resonating.</p> <p>“There’s a Cat Person brand of cat food,” Roupenian says. “People send pictures to me and are like ‘do you get a percentage?’ And I’m like, no, I didn’t actually invent the phrase ‘cat person’.”</p> <p>Just at that moment, a cat appears behind her on the Zoom call.</p> <p>“Yep, he’s there,” she confirms. “Has no opinions on any of this.”</p> <p>So is a stage musical the next logical step for a short story that seems destined to have nine lives?</p> <p>Roupenian laughs. “You never know,” she says.</p> <p><strong>Cat Person is in cinemas from November 23.</strong></p> <p><strong>Email Garry Maddox at <a href=\"mailto:gmaddox@smh.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">gmaddox@smh.com.au</a> and follow him on Twitter at <a href=\"mailto:gmaddox@smh.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">gmaddox@smh.com.au</a>.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56jp0\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p><strong>Telemarketers</strong><br/>★★★★★<br/><strong>Binge, from August 14 (new episodes each Monday)</strong></p> <p>“I worked at CDG for seven years, and I never could’ve imagined I was part of the biggest telemarketing scam in American history… but Pat was onto it from the start. Pat was born to be a whistleblower,” says filmmaker Sam Lipman-Stern at the opening of <em>Telemarketers</em>, setting the scene for HBO’s remarkable new three-part docuseries.</p> <p>What follows is the wild journey of two ne’er-do-wells who decide to take on a billion-dollar industry all the way to the halls of Washington DC, with their bong pipes ever handy.</p> <p>Lipman-Stern was a 14-year-old high-school dropout in the early ’00s when he joined CDG (Civic Development Group), a call centre in New Jersey, where his job – and those of his co-workers, including his enigmatic buddy Pat Pespas – was to persuade people to donate to charities associated with police and firefighters unions.</p> <p>It was, unsurprisingly, a scam. In 2010, CDG was hit with a record civil fine by the US’s Federal Trade Commission and its owners banned from telemarketing for life. Not that the money-hungry chicanery stopped there, as Lipman-Stern and Pespas soon uncovered, initiating their deep-dive into the “dark side of American capitalism”.</p> <p>You wouldn’t imagine a docuseries about a telemarketing scandal could rouse the senses, but here we are. The series’ greatest strength is its intimacy. Stretching back 20 years, <em>Telemarketers</em> plays like both political thriller and buddy comedy, fuelled by camcorder footage Lipman-Stern shot from the beginning just for YouTube kicks.</p> <p>Shot on grainy video (you can tell why the Safdie brothers, executive producers on the series, were aesthetically attracted to the material), the early call centre scenes play like <em>The Office</em> if <em>The Office</em> was real and seedy and populated by drug addicts and ex-cons.</p> <p>The CDG bunch are a rabble of misfits, hard on their luck and short of opportunity: they can’t get jobs elsewhere by virtue of their criminal records. Such is the stacked system of rehabilitation, where petty crime gets you a life sentence in telemarketing and white-collar crookedness a mere slap on the wrist.</p> <p>Despite their work (robbing old ladies of cash, for the benefit of their bosses’ Christian rock star dreams), Lipman-Stern’s insider perspective grants his co-workers sympathy.</p> <p>Among the group is “telemarketing legend” Pespas, the kind of unforgettable character that great documentaries unearth once in a blue moon (think Mike Schank in 1999’s <em>American Movie</em>, Lips from 2008’s <em>Anvil</em>). In a Hollywood remake, he’d be played by Zach Galifianakis or Paul Walter Hauser at his ditziest. It’s only a matter of time till Pat’s face graces T-shirts, believe me.</p> <p>Although our introduction to Pat is watching him perennially nodding off on the job (in one incredible scene, he snorts heroin on his lunchbreak then excitedly ventures back into the call centre to complete a $95 sale), he’s a guru of sorts to Lipman-Stern, sweet and cynical and streetwise and alert to the absurdity of his existence. “They want people like me at CDG,” he says of his employers, through sardonic resignation. “This way they could pull all the shady crap and they figure you won’t do anything about it because you’re doing shady crap to begin with.”</p> <p>Beyond the greed, the subterfuge, the thrilling exposé of a corrupt industry and the reach of its grimy tentacles (especially in a US where the polemic divide between “defund the police” and “#BlueLivesMatter” is easily exploited), the show’s life-affirming, emotional heft lies in Pat’s decent struggle for spiritual redemption. <em>Telemarketers</em> is really a gritty hero’s quest in the guise of a telemarketing take down. When Sam plays an old phone message of Pat saying, “We’ve gotta take them down from the inside!,” you want the pair, as unlikely as it seems, to win.</p> <p>As we progress, their play-acting as muckrakers becomes as invigorating as it is inept. In a hilarious recurring bit, delivered whenever they’re suddenly railroaded by an intended target, they evoke the spirit of Michael Moore, documentary’s patron saint of righteous ambushes. “We’re getting this interview… Michael Moore-style!” Pat exclaims before a tense meeting with chiefs from the FOP (Fraternal Order of Police). Just wait and see how it goes.</p> <p>For all its eye-opening focus on the shady intricacies of the telemarketing industry (already supersized by AI), the series is also a galvanising piece of gonzo agitprop. Let the battle against the bastards, in all their forms (even Christian rockers), ever continue. And please: Pat Pespas for president in 2024.</p> <p><b>To read more from</b><b><i> Spectrum</i></b><b>, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/spectrum-smh-hog\" target=\"_blank\">visit our page here</a>.</b></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.</i></b><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p><strong>HOLLYWOOD</strong><br/><em><strong>Burn It Down: Power, Complicity and a Call for Change in Hollywood </strong></em><br/><strong>Maureen Ryan</strong><br/><strong>HarperCollins, $60</strong></p> <p>Maureen Ryan is as mad as hell about what’s been happening in Hollywood. And the<em> Vanity Fair</em> contributing editor has written <em>Burn It Down</em> to tell readers why. “What should be assessed is not just the creative product, its financial cost, and its efficiency (or lack thereof),” she writes, “It’s also how productive and nurturing an environment it is.” Something that she goes to great lengths to explain isn’t happening now and never has been.</p> <p>Her book, which deals mainly but not exclusively with the world of television, was written before the recent strikes by the American Writers and Screen Actors Guilds and doesn’t deal directly with the specific issues that have provoked them. But it does point to a range of resentments that have been simmering away for years, to do with how workplaces that ought to service the needs of employees have frequently become hellholes.</p> <p>To most readers, much of this won’t come as a surprise. Hollywood has long been infamous for what was once seen as routine behaviour but is now regarded as disreputable. The public testimonies of the courageous survivors of sexual assaults by men in powerful positions have exposed some of the darker activities hidden behind the surface gloss of the American film business.</p> <p>Ryan mentions in passing that she herself suffered this fate at the hands of an unnamed TV executive. She wrote at some length about it in <em>Variety</em> in October 2017, and her smouldering anger about what happened permeates the book.</p> <p>Drawing on the experiences of a young actress, she even goes so far as to liken what goes on in Hollywood to the way cults conduct themselves. “How is a cult that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day all that different from a set (or a workplace) that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day?“</p> <p>Her overall approach is messy, featuring long-winded attempts to explode myths about the Hollywood business, most of which were blasted to smithereens long ago. But she also provides compelling, detailed accounts of the failures and moral breakdowns that have occurred behind the scenes on the long-running series, <em>Lost</em> (2004–2010) and <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> (2013–2017), and that (contrary to the view that emerges, fictionalised, in Curtis Sittenfeld’s irresistible novel, <em>Romantic Comedy</em>) allegedly continue at NBC’s <em>Saturday Night Live,</em> the late-night sketch comedy show that has been around for almost half a century, and elsewhere.</p> <p>Some of her sources allow her to use their names; others choose to remain anonymous whistleblowers, fearful of the consequences for their careers if they become known as troublemakers. She manages to get a few of those accused – “the sinister forces in the shadows” – to go on the record with their responses, but most ignored her requests for interview.</p> <p>Stories abound of nightmare situations arising in writers’ rooms, on sets and in private offices, around racism, sexism, homophobia, inequitable returns for efforts, and the systemic abuse of those without power. Ryan’s crusader-like passion sometimes leads to overkill, the litany of sins that she uncovers providing more examples than required to make her points when a more selective approach would have been more effective.</p> <p>But it does mean that many of those that the system has turned into victims do get an opportunity to have their voices heard, even if only as “Joyce” or “Hannah”, or any of the other names she attaches to those who wish to avoid reprisal.</p> <p>Ryan is especially illuminating in her examination of some of the disturbing developments at <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. In this context, she cites journalist Seth Simons’ astute but unfashionable notion that stand-up comedians have long occupied a space for an ugly culture, one “where it has been OK to be a horrible person” (a point that becomes especially pertinent in the light of the coverage of Russell Brand’s transgressions).</p> <p>In the final section of the book, acknowledging that there’s no magic fix for the problems she’s identified, Ryan proposes several ways in which it might be possible to repair “the damage created by allowing toxic people – and systems – to run amok”.</p> <p>She quotes <em>The Atlantic’s</em> Adam Serwer about the best way to go about it: “The hope for a more equitable, democratic and prosperous society does not lie with enlightened corporations but with organised workers.” And, in line with this, she points to the need for writers, actors and others to work together to establish grassroots alliances and respectful workplaces in which to do their creative work.</p> <p>She ends by explaining that she’s no revolutionary, that she doesn’t actually want to burn Hollywood down. What she really wants is a business equivalent of a “prescribed burn”, one that can help prevent a wildfire. “Fire can be rejuvenating,” she writes, creating a neat analogy courtesy of <em>National Geographic</em>. “It returns nutrients to the soil … and can help young trees and other plants start to grow.”</p> <p><em>Burn It Down</em> sometimes labours its points, but the urgency with which Ryan champions her cause is both affecting and effective.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'headline': 'Sex Education has lost none of its charm, even as the world changes on and off screen',\n",
       "  'description': '<p>Set at Moordale Secondary, a fictional English high school, <em>Sex Education</em> premiered quietly on Netflix in January 2019. Its focus was the familiar and reliably appealing territory of teen trials: nervous attractions, giddy liaisons, rocky relationships and the accompanying uncertainty and anxiety. Over three seasons, the series extended much of that very human excitement and messiness about sex and relationships to some of the students’ teachers and parents.</p> <p>Created by Laurie Nunn, <em>Sex Education</em> approached what could be seen as the well-traversed terrain of adolescent angst and romance with uncommon candour: the frank discussion of sex and unblinking depiction of it, as well as an open-minded portrayal of Moordale’s diverse community.</p> <p>Originally, the series was part of a push that represented a new type of TV, one unshackled from the conventions that ruled broadcast network television. In this branch of pay-TV, there were no sponsors to please or advertisers to alarm, just subscribers to woo. It arrived like a bright and shiny example of the kind of productions that the brave new world of streaming might offer.</p> <p>The pilot had been rejected by so many possible distributors that Nunn had resigned herself to the belief that the project had died until Netflix picked it up. And it became a sleeper hit for the pioneering streamer as it introduced the trials of Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield), the teenage son of divorced sex therapist Jean (Gillian Anderson), the premise being that Otis had learnt so much about sex – in spite of his initial lack of direct experience of it – that he becomes a sex therapist for fellow students. At the urging of classmate Maeve Wiley (Emma Mackey), who cannily identifies a business opportunity that can be exploited using his skills, they establish an unofficial practice in a disused toilet block. And there’s robust demand for his services.</p> <p>Over the seasons, <em>Sex Education</em> hasn’t changed: it’s still high-spirited, warm-hearted and inclusive, generous in spirit and forgiving of its characters’ foibles and flaws. There have been some storylines that haven’t quite gelled, such as the one involving the coolly manipulative headmistress (Jemima Kirke) who replaced disgraced headmaster Michael Groff (Alistair Petrie) in season three. But essentially, <em>Sex Education</em> has remained a sweet charmer boosted by a vibrant cast and determined to embrace humanity in all its elation and confusion.</p> <p>Yet the landscape around the series has certainly shifted as some of the lustre vanished from the glittering world of streaming. Its incursion into the established sphere of small-screen programming brought with it the promise of flexibility and freedom, and the increasingly crowded market of providers spent big on content. But recent years have exposed fundamental problems. The business model for many of these enterprises, built on the premise of sustained growth, has proved wobbly. Some services are now facing savage cost-cutting, and there are predictions that several won’t survive.</p> <p>Cash was wildly splashed around in avid pursuit of subscribers hungry for exciting shows to binge. But along with bold and commendable choices – such as <em>Sex Education</em> – came a veritable tsunami of mediocre productions, myriad reboots and high-concept ideas that have proved half-baked.</p> <p>How many promising-looking series have you started in recent years only to abandon them after one or two episodes because they’re dull and formulaic, uninspired exercises in box-ticking? In this context, Netflix’s vapid thriller <em>Who Is Erin Carter?</em> is a recent and duly disappointing symbol.<br/>So, it turns out that the new world, just like the old one, has its issues. It’s not the land of unbridled promise that it initially appeared to be, even though it undeniably has its qualities.</p> <p>The happy news is that, as it enters its fourth and final season, <em>Sex Education</em> remains the same colourful, cleverly drawn charmer it’s always been, as well as being an illustration of what the streamers can offer that their free-TV rivals can’t. When we left Moordale at the end of the third season, the school was closing down, Jean had given birth to baby Joy, and Otis and Maeve had, following numerous miscommunications and missed opportunities, become a couple. The new season sees many of the characters negotiating a further time of transition.</p> <p>Many Moordale students have relocated to Cavendish College, a modern, pastel-toned establishment that’s a vivid contrast to their former school. Here, conservation-conscious activists mindfully recycle and attend yoga classes, meditation sessions and silent discos. Otis and his exuberant best pal, Eric (Ncuti Gatwa), see the place as an opportunity for a fresh start, with the former aiming to re-establish his sex-advice clinic. Meanwhile, Maeve is away at the American college that awarded her a writing scholarship and the once-calm, composed and confident Jean has found that caring for a newborn has reduced her to a rattled mess.</p> <p>For all the characters, there are fresh challenges and opportunities, as well as a search for direction, reassurance and community amid the whirl of life. Otis, once a virginal sex therapist, is just one of a variety of multifaceted characters that Nunn has created. Now more experienced due to his own affairs, he’s an informed and empathetic therapist, although he’s still just as messed up as everyone else. “For someone who’s supposed to be emotionally intelligent, you can be such an immature arsehole sometimes,” Maeve quite reasonably snaps at him during a long-distance argument.</p> <p>The shiny world of streaming might’ve lost some of its gloss since <em>Sex Education</em> premiered, but this show hasn’t lost its spark.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

Each night, Cosgriff solicits her audience to find out their top 10 likes – all of which she notes down in a self-professed “book of tiny delights”.</p> <p>Interspersed with this gentle form of audience participation are humorous anecdotes and highly infectious, clever, original songs that Cosgriff belts out about her own likes while her hands move across her keyboard at a dizzying pace. Cosgriff’s a whip-smart, quick-witted, confident performer.</p> <p>It becomes clear towards the end that what undergirds the show is a simultaneous sense of sorrow and joy – it’s a credit to Cosgriff that she can hold space for both, leaving audiences with an incredibly affirming (and funny) show that marvels in the tiny profundities that make up our lives.<br/><em>Reviewed by Sonia Nair</em></p> <p><strong>COMEDY</strong><br/><strong>Patrick Golamco | Pork Adobo</strong><br/><a href=\"https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2023/shows/pork-adobo\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trades Hall, until April 23</strong></a></p> <p>Patrick Golamco is surely a lock for a Best Newcomer nomination this festival.</p> <p>Having come runner-up in the 2021 RAW Comedy National Grand Final, and storming Comedy Zone in 2022, his debut Melbourne solo show is loosely tied together by a story of visiting his 99-year-old grandmother in Manila to let her know he loves her while she may be on her deathbed.</p> <p>Through song, breakneck-speed jokes and tales of therapy gone awry, he harnesses the neurotic, introverted nature of Luke McGregor, the shake-your-head puns of Tim Vine and the pull-the-rug-from-your-feet energy of Mitch Hedberg all at once.</p> <p>There are sharp jabs at Catholics, his Chinese upbringing, and of course, tales of the titular recipe – all which are delivered with the aplomb of a festival veteran.</p> <p>At only 40 minutes in length it’s on the leaner side of shows this year.

Ben Hunter shared his love of playing goal defence in netball and hesitation to hang out his clothes; Samuel Gebreselassie delivered deeply dark material of why Ethiopia is now famous for aviation disasters rather than famine; and Annie Boyle’s delivery was so dry that it left the audience parched.

In 2007, he won the top gong at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. If the rules allowed you to win more than once, he’d have another half-dozen on his mantelpiece.</p> <p>Make no mistake – Kitson is the greatest comedian of his generation. Even if his aversion to press, media and podcasts means the majority have never heard of him. When other comedians see him perform, often they consider quitting the art form, knowing that they’ll never reach the same heights. It’s known as a term within the cognoscenti as “the Kitson effect”.</p> <p>Does this all sound sycophantic? Probably. But is it hyperbole? Absolutely not.</p> <p>A poll conducted by Dave, a TV channel that is a subsidiary of BBC, saw British comics including the ilk of Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee, Tim Vine, Mark Watson, Jason Byrne and Greg Davies all agreeing that he reigned supreme.</p> <p>The sold-out audience for the stuttering Brit’s latest 90-minute show at 12pm on a Sunday is filled to the brim with other award-winning comics from the festival watching on.</p> <p>The show is a masterclass of delivery, quips and callbacks.

       "  'description': '<p>Whoever decided to release <i>Triangle of Sadness </i>at Christmas time in Australia must have a sense of humour as wicked as that of the movie itself. Written and directed by the Swedish filmmaker Ruben Ostlund, <i>Triangle </i>is a bracing movie, but it isn’t your standard holiday fare. When it premiered at Cannes earlier this year, it won the Palme d’Or, and got an eight-minute standing ovation. It also prompted some audience walkouts, for reasons we’ll get to.</p> <p>I knew I was going to love the film after an early scene set at a fashion parade. Before the event begins, an usher rudely evicts some audience members from the front row, even though their tickets prove they’re in the right place. Once these plebs have been removed, a party of ticketless fashion-world celebrities is fawningly escorted to the vacant seats. Then the models start strutting down the catwalk, in front of a big slogan proclaiming the event’s theme: <i>We’re All Equal</i>.</p> <p><i>Triangle of Sadness</i> is a rare beast: an aggressive and grown-up social satire, with a fully functioning brain and fangs. Clearly, Ostlund is fed up with the shallow, self-congratulatory world of Botox and Instagram, and he wants to give it a salutary kick up the arse. He’s got the kind of crankily irreverent sensibility you still occasionally encounter in literature, if you’re lucky, but almost never at the movies. At times his film assaults your senses, but it never insults your intelligence.</p> <p>In the opening act, we meet a couple of young fashion models: Carl, played by the English actor Harris Dickinson, and Yaya, played by the South African actress Charlbi Dean, who died unexpectedly a few months after the film’s triumph at Cannes.</p> <p>Carl and Yaya have used their good looks to build a sideline career as online influencers. In that capacity they’ve scored free tickets to go on a luxury cruise with various representatives of the global financial elite: a Russian fertiliser magnate, a Nordic app-coder, a couple of elderly British arms dealers. The only American on board is the ship’s drunken captain, played by Woody Harrelson.</p> <p>After a day at sea, the guests assemble in the ship’s dining room for a swanky welcome-aboard meal. The weather turns rough, and Ostlund’s camera begins to lurch ominously from side to side. As swaying waiters bring out course after course of haute cuisine, the diners succumb to seasickness. An orgy of mass vomiting follows, which goes on for something like 15 minutes.</p> <p>This is the part that prompted the walkouts at Cannes. You can see why. Until now, the Mr Creosote scene in Monty Python’s <i>Meaning of Life</i> has been the benchmark for over-the-top cinematic regurgitation. The stricken diners in <i>Triangle of Sadness</i> make Mr Creosote look like an underachiever. Nor is seasickness their only plight. Some food poisoning seems to be in the mix too, since seasickness alone would not produce the full range of gastric calamities that Ostlund outrageously depicts.</p> <p>“Maybe I did go too far,” Ostlund has said of his chundering sequence. “But I wanted to.” That could be the mantra of any self-respecting satirist. Decent satire <i>should</i> go too far; it should use bad taste in a good cause. Ostlund wants to remind us that no matter how rich or good-looking we are, we’re all just mammals, and all subject to the same humiliating bodily laws. All good satire has a levelling effect, and nothing is more deflating to human self-regard than a serious gastric emergency.</p> <p>There are subtler moments in Ostlund’s film, but the barfing sequence is the part that people will remember and talk about. The rest of the film merely engages your intellect. The barfing sequence makes you feel Ostlund’s moral disgust at a gut level. It uses gross-out humour to make a serious ethical point.</p> <p>Here Ostlund is participating in a tradition that goes back at least as far as the 1500s, when Rabelais wrote his earthy epic <i>Gargantua and Pantagruel. </i>That novel recounted the bawdy exploits of a family of French giants, and it laid heavy stress on the body’s baser functions, including vomiting, which Rabelais called “skinning the fox”.</p> <p>The Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin coined a great name for the literary mode that Rabelais more or less invented: he called it “grotesque realism”. The Rabelaisian approach caught on fast in English literature. Shakespeare was a Rabelais fan. The corpulent, wine-guzzling Falstaff is a palpably Rabelaisian figure. And when Iago talks about “making the beast with two backs”, he’s quoting from <i>Gargantua and Pantagruel</i>.</p> <p>Jonathan Swift, the most famous satirist in our language, was a master of politically charged dunny humour. In <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i> (1726), Gulliver visits the island kingdom of Lilliput, where the locals are only six inches tall. When the royal palace catches fire, the Lilliputians fight the blaze with thimble-sized buckets of water. Fortunately Gulliver has a full bladder, so he whips out his privy member and hoses the palace with urine, “which I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper places, that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished”.</p> <p>A few years after he wrote <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i>, Swift’s satirical imagination went to the other end of the human digestive tract. In his pamphlet <i>A Modest Proposal</i>, he floated the idea of easing the burden on Ireland’s poor by feeding their children to the rich.</p> <p>Satire can be an ugly form, if the satirist is angry enough. Joseph Heller’s anti-war novel <i>Catch-22</i> (1961) had the soldier in white – a maimed serviceman lying mutely in a hospital bed, encased in plaster from head to toe. A jar of fluid drains into him via a tube attached to his elbow; another jar near his groin collects his waste. When that jar is full and the other one empty, they are switched. The soldier in white is just a body, in the starkest possible sense. He’s a vessel for consuming and expelling fluids. He may not even be alive.</p> <p>A few critics of <i>Triangle of Sadness </i>have suggested that the movie isn’t much chop, because it takes aim at barn-sized targets like Instagram and financial inequality. <i>So what if Ostlund dislikes those things?</i> these critics say. <i>Who doesn’t? </i></p> <p>But the best satirists have always taken aim at barn-sized targets. War. Religion. Human folly. It isn’t the size of the target that matters. It’s the inventiveness of the execution.</p> <p>Stanley Kubrick’s <i>Dr Strangelove</i> (1964) is one of the greatest satirical movies ever made. The target of its ridicule was nuclear Armageddon – and who wasn’t against <i>that</i>? The most resonant scene in Kubrick’s film was the last one, where Slim Pickens rides the descending nuke as if it’s a bronco. It wasn’t the best-written or best-performed scene in <i>Strangelove</i>, but it was the moment that conveyed the film’s rage most eloquently.</p> <p>Swift said that satire is a sort of mirror, “wherein beholders do generally discover everybody’s face but their own.” Clever satirists can get away with a lot. At the height of the Vietnam war, no Hollywood studio was going to bankroll a film that ridiculed that conflict directly. So Robert Altman made <i>M*A*S*H</i> (1970), which was set during the Korean War, but was plainly about the insanity in Vietnam.</p> <p>Altman opposed that insanity by making his film as earthy as possible. Surgical scenes that set a new benchmark for on-screen gore were juxtaposed with shower-block pranks that broke new ground in the depiction of nudity. <i>M*A*S*H</i> was also the first American studio picture to feature the f-word. Admittedly, the shock value of that particular coup has worn off.</p> <p>Not that satire always has to shock you. <i>The White Lotus</i>, the second series of which recently wrapped up on Binge and Foxtel, was billed as a satire. But Mike White, the show’s creator, is a very gentle kind of satirist. In <i>Triangle of Sadness</i>, Ostlund’s finger is always on the scales. Sometimes his whole fist is on there. White’s brand of satire is far more hands-off.</p> <p>Like the first series, the second series of <i>The White Lotus</i> dealt with a bunch of American tourists behaving badly at a foreign luxury resort. The only central character to appear in both seasons was the insufferable Tanya McQuoid, played by Jennifer Coolidge.</p> <p>Tanya is an American grotesque – hyper-rich, self-absorbed, and staggeringly uncultured. She’s so cartoonish a character that she sometimes seems to have strayed into the show from the nearby set of a far broader comedy. But really she serves as White’s satirical lynchpin. She’s his version of the barfing scene – the big gaudy effect at the show’s centre, whose impact allows him to make subtler points in the surrounding storylines.</p> <p>On the whole, White’s Americans are so decadent and morally lost that they make you wonder if their culture is in terminal decline. But Mike White is part of that culture too, and as long as America can still produce entertainment as edgy and self-aware as <i>The White Lotus</i>, it would be premature to write the place off.</p> <p>This is the paradoxical thing about satire. It tends to flourish at precisely the moment when everything else is going to pot. When a filmmaker spends 15 minutes showing people voiding the contents of their stomachs in all directions, it seems safe to say that his society is not in the best of health. The consolation is that satire may now be entering one of its golden periods.</p> <p>In the early 1960s, the great English comic Peter Cook opened a satirical venue in London called the Establishment Club. The place was modelled, he said, on “those wonderful Berlin cabarets that did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the outbreak of the Second World War”.</p> <p>In other words, even the best satirists can’t change the world. All they can do is show us how comically awful it is. If things are going to get any better, that’s up to the rest of us.</p> <p><b>To read more from</b><b><i> Spectrum</i></b><b>, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/spectrum-smh-hog\" target=\"_blank\">visit our page here</a>.</b></p> <p><em><strong>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56kr7\" target=\"_blank\">Get it delivered every Friday</a>.<br/></strong></em></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p>Fortescue Metals billionaire and international green saviour <strong>Andrew Forrest</strong> long ago appropriated as flattery <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/rear-window/andrew-forrest-greenwashing-fortescue-billions-in-huon-takeover-fight-20210817-p58jke\" target=\"_blank\">my observation</a> that there is only gossamer between a visionary and a madman.</p> <p>His barnstorming on-stage performances of the past week have been classics of the messianic genre.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, Forrest addressed the Boao Forum in Perth. I tuned in, having been primed for an explanation of Fortescue CEO <strong>Fiona Hick’</strong>s shock departure after just six months – six months being an eternity at Twiggy’s manic pace.</p> <p>“This clean energy presentation you’re about to see may explain a lot, particularly to my Fortescue family,” Forrest began. “There’s been changes, and there’s been a steely discipline about our future … We stick to that future. Individual ambitions come second because what I’m talking about is the course of humanity.”</p> <p>There’s been changes, but let’s talk about me saving humanity. Wow. I mean, that’s another whole column right there.</p> <p>Without delay, Forrest’s seminar descended into a doom loop of climate catastrophe – <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em> for Microsoft Powerpoint – with slides entitled “This is the beginning of the end”, “Lethal humidity is already here” and “You can have a cardiopulmonary bypass.”</p> <p>It was part televangelist, part cult leader, part TED talk parody. “It’s business that will kill your children.” Don’t believe him? “You are so yesterday.” “A clever person can make something complicated, a genius will make it simple … Just saying, this is science.” At one point, his voice seemed to crack with emotion.</p> <p>He railed against $7 trillion of global fossil fuel subsidies an entire 48 hours after Fortescue disclosed it guzzled 633 million litres of diesel fuel in financial 2023 (unchanged on the previous year), securing it $300 million in the Australian government’s Fuel Tax Credit for Heavy Diesel Vehicles.</p> <p>If Twiggy was standing outside the State Library in a Nepalese poncho with a megaphone, you’d cross the street to avoid him. Instead, he’s the proprietor of a $65 billion company with a massive chequebook, so everyone nods along in unison.</p> <p>On Monday, Fortescue announced that “the board has decided to expedite the appointment of <strong>Dino Otranto</strong> as chief executive”. The appointment was announced to the ASX at 8:53am eastern time and by 11am the annual report was published with Otranto’s CEO message in pride of place.</p> <p>Fiona Hick never was. A placeholder at best. Otranto was always the guy. The board merely expedited the inevitable!</p> <p>This spin was audacious. The reasons for parting ways with Hick might have been entirely necessary and reasonable. Even so, what was being projected here was quite obviously not what was going on.</p> <p>Poor Dino. One minute he’s out the back tinkering with a dusty conveyor belt and the next, he’s taking heavy fire from sell-side analysts. It’s like <strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin</strong>’s meat-grinder, where Russian prisoners are released for “training missions” only to find themselves at the Ukrainian front. Ninety minutes later, Dino’s headlining the annual result alongside Fortescue Future Industries chief <strong>Mark Hutchinson</strong>, the keeper of <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/rear-window/andrew-forrest-insane-in-the-membrane-20230219-p5clq7\" target=\"_blank\">the membrane</a>. The idea that you get a ring-in to present the financial results of Australia’s 10th biggest public company is just wild.</p> <h2>A lot going on</h2> <p>Almost as wild as <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/voice-debate-follows-andrew-forrest-into-the-pilbara-20230827-p5dzru\" target=\"_blank\">Fortescue’s 20th birthday party in the Pilbara on Saturday</a> at the company’s Solomon mine for hundreds of VIP guests flown in by chartered jets. As widely reported, Forrest arrived on a 600-tonne haul truck waving a flag emblazoned with the Fortescue logo. He was dressed in a tan suit and silk cravat, a look pioneered by Michael Corleone in Havana in <em>The Godfather Part II</em>. There was a lot going on there, there really was.</p> <p>There they all were, slurping back the oysters in the Pilbara – two things that should never go together. The carbon miles on those oysters. I shudder to imagine.</p> <p>What a crowd Forrest pulled. It was Darrell Lea’s random allsorts of public life, Twiggy’s McHappy Meal figurines. <strong>Eddie McGuire</strong>. Baby <strong>John Burgess</strong> was unavailable. <strong>Mark Textor</strong>. Riiight.<strong> Alex Waislitz</strong> – would go to the opening of an oyster. <strong>Kelly Bayer Rosmarin</strong>. Does Forrest get his burner phones from Optus? <strong>Kwasi Kwarteng</strong>, the UK chancellor for 38 days until he crashed the gilt market. Now <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/andrew-forrest-offers-work-to-former-uk-chancellor-kwasi-kwarteng-20230829-p5e0cg\" target=\"_blank\">Twiggy’s offered him a job</a>. Of course he has. Imagine what he could do to the Fortescue balance sheet.</p> <p>It was like the crazy menagerie of groupies who colonised Graceland towards the end, when Elvis was downstairs in his velvet jim-jams, too stoned to move.</p> <p>In contrast, Forrest was the last on the dance floor at 2am and four hours later he’s switching out CEOs. Twiggy is a force of nature, to be sure, but can you imagine the adrenal fatigue that goes with playing the character of Andrew Forrest 24/7? That would push anyone right onto that gossamer thin line. He looks exhausted. Who is actually putting down their Veuve Clicquot, putting down their oyster and saying, “Andrew, are you alright, mate?”</p> <p>Not Fortescue’s newest board member, <strong>Larry Marshall</strong>, who grabbed the microphone to declare Forrest “the greatest Australian entrepreneur I’ve ever met”. This is a supposed <em>independent</em> director of a public company, and he’s publicly brown-nosing the controlling shareholder.</p> <p>Not (outgoing) lead independent director <strong>Mark Barnaba</strong>, trousering $1.3 million in board fees to hold Australia’s biggest rubber stamp. He’s getting paid like <strong>Ken MacKenzie</strong> to do what for minority shareholders, exactly? To rattle around Perth <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/rear-window/gyrating-mark-barnaba-helps-surprise-malcolm-mccusker-20230813-p5dw3l\" target=\"_blank\">in his Village People costume</a>? He’s saying “That’s a great idea, Twiggy, whatever you think. Bring on the oysters, bring on the membrane.” Barnaba is Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell, who says to his agent Jerry Maguire, “You are hanging on by a very thin thread … and I dig that about you!”</p> <p>Remember, Forrest must maintain the supreme confidence of the capital markets because he cannot fund this mad green hydrogen vision on his own. At some point he’ll have to divert all of Fortescue’s free cash into these projects, or go to the market, or to private partners, and say “You need to trust me.”</p> <p>Forrest is playing so many characters for so many audiences, all at light speed. Who knows what’s really happening back there, behind the mask. Based on Wednesday’s performance, nobody, not even Forrest, knows the answer to that question.</p> <p><em>The original version of this article referred to Rod Tidwell, a character in the film </em>Jerry Maguire<em>, as the Arizona Cardinals’ quarterback. He was a wide receiver. </em></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p><em>Frasier</em>, or what is now its first incarnation, is one of my favourite TV shows. Ever. A shining example of what a classic studio-based sitcom can be, the <em>Cheers</em> spin-off ran for 11 seasons (1993-2004) and exited on a high, laden with awards and leaving joy, enormous affection and abiding admiration in its wake.</p> <p>From the outset, it exceeded expectations. It was the offshoot of a successful series that actually proved worthwhile, plucking snobbish, self-important psychiatrist Dr Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) from the vibrant community at Boston’s Cheers bar to head his own comic troupe in Seattle.</p> <p>He arrives as the host of a radio talk show and is soon surrounded by a pitch-perfect ensemble: David Hyde Pierce as his pernickety brother Niles, who’s fussy, germphobic and equally snooty in his appreciation of the finer things; John Mahoney as their gruff retired cop father Martin, a blue-collar bloke who likes beer, sports and his duct-taped recliner; Peri Gilpin as feisty radio producer Roz, a lusty single gal lookin’ for love, or at least happy hook-ups; and Jane Leeves as Daphne, a delightfully daffy Pom who claims psychic powers, is employed as Martin’s physical therapist housekeeper, and becomes the long-time object of Niles’ unarticulated devotion.</p> <p>In an indication of the kind of inspiration that distinguished the series, there’s also Niles’ oft-mentioned but unseen wife, Maris, and Martin’s cute and crafty canine companion, Eddie (Moose). From its cleverly crafted pilot, <em>Frasier</em> establishes a rich range of personality and culture clashes that are skilfully mined over the seasons. And, over its long life, the show was also graced by a stellar parade of guest stars, many of whom won Emmys for their contributions (including Anthony La Paglia).</p> <p>Sophisticated, warm-hearted and astute, <em>Frasier</em> Mark 1 always gives you a little more than you’re anticipating, frequently pushing a gag one beat further than expected, to delightful effect. It offers wonderfully witty repartee, expertly conceived and choreographed physical comedy, and sometimes deliciously over-the-top farce. It can shift seamlessly between slapstick and genuinely affecting emotion. Its richly drawn characters radiate vitality. Pick any of the 263 episodes (they’re all available on Paramount+), you won’t be disappointed. The show is a sure-fire tonic anytime you need a boost.</p> <p>Which is why news of its revival filled me with trepidation. How could any revisiting possibly attain those heights? Beyond that, in an age awash with regrettable revivals, there’s the danger of tarnishing a distinguished legacy by lumbering it with a pale companion piece.</p> <p>The recent revival (Paramount+), which Grammer has called his “third act”, sees its title character returning to Boston and landing a teaching job at Harvard. The move, 20 years on from the first series, reintroduces Frasier following his departure from a long-running TV talk show. Flushed with funds, he’s something of a celebrity and keen to be closer to his son, Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott), with whom he has a strained relationship.</p> <p><em>Frasier</em> Mark II has many fathers, from David Angell, Peter Casey, David Lee and James Burrows, who created <em>Cheers</em>, to Glen and Les Charles, who originally devised the pompous shrink as a love interest for prissy barmaid Diane (Shelley Long), to Joe Cristalli (<em>Life in Pieces</em>) and Chris Harris (<em>How I Met Your Mother</em>), who developed the latest variation. You can feel the latter pair trying to reignite the Frasier magic in their next-gen production, juggling the ingredients in an effort to replicate the dynamics that made its predecessor zing.</p> <p>A range of familiar character traits and recognisable conflicts is revisited, although the shapes have shifted as elements have been shuffled around. The Brit/Yank clash now comes from Frasier’s old Oxford buddy and Harvard officemate, dryly cynical lush Alan “Corny” Cornwall (Nicholas Lyndhurst). The blue-collar/white-collar opposition of odd-couple apartment mates – fine wine versus beer, sports versus opera, foie gras versus beef jerky – has been reversed: instead of son Frasier and father Martin, it’s father Frasier and firefighter son Freddy.</p> <p>The radio station has become a university department. Instead of Martin’s Jack Russell terrier, there’s Corny’s cat. And everyone gathers at Mahoney’s Taproom – named in honour of actor John Mahoney, who died in 2018 – which resembles a cosy cross between the <em>Cheers</em> bar and Cafe Nervosa, <em>Frasier</em>’s Seattle coffee shop.</p> <p>Grammer has slipped back into his multi-award-winning role as easily as his character might into a pair of Gucci loafers. But other characters are thinly and sometimes clumsily drawn, particularly nerdy, nervy nephew David (Anders Keith), Niles and Daphne’s highly strung klutz of a son, and Olivia Finch (Toks Olagundoye), the ambitious psych faculty head. However, Freddy’s friend and neighbour, widowed new mum and waitress-actress Eve (Jess Salgueiro), supplies some spark and down-to-earth smarts that can puncture Frasier’s pomposity, as did Roz.</p> <p>Lovely as it is to see those simple, stylish animated black-and-white opening credits again, complete with a subtly adapted skyline, the opener dumps a load of expository information in a rush with little pizzazz: about Martin’s death, Freddy dropping out of Harvard, Frasier’s TV career and the end of his affair with Charlotte (Laura Linney). The canned laughter is annoying and excessive, serving only to draw attention to gags that fall flat.</p> <p>Yet some of the exchanges have the desired oomph: “The only girls we could ever get to curl up with us were the Bronte sisters,” muses Frasier of his wild university days. “Or Emily Dickinson for a quickie,” Corny concurs.</p> <p>On the basis of the first five episodes (of 10) available for preview, the revival is a mixed bag. It’s not irredeemable, but it’s yet to achieve anything approximating the heights of its predecessor. Maybe that’s a lot to ask, especially in the absence of invaluable contributors such as Pierce and Mahoney. But if they are irreplaceable, the motivations for an encore are open to speculation.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'headline': 'Steph Tisdell and Dylan Alcott find common ground in new series of Bump',\n",
       "  'description': '<p>Into the ever-evolving, marvellous mess that is the <i>Bump</i> family, Claudia Karvan and Kelsey Munro’s comedy-drama series about young love, unexpected pregnancy and so much more, drop two new intriguing characters.</p> <p>Playing teal independent mayor Shauna Johnson, who terrorises her new staffer, young mum Oly (Nathalie Morris), is comedian and Yidinji woman Steph Tisdell. The 2022 Australian of the year, Paralympian and broadcaster Dylan Alcott, plays the mayor’s assistant and secret admirer.</p> <p>“In a lot of weird ways, Dylan and I can relate to each other,” says Tisdell, who also appears in the Delta Goodrem Netflix rom-com <i>Love is in the Air</i>. “The feeling of being representative of something, and also trying to be representative of yourself. Also, he does keynotes and emceeing, and I do that too, so we had a lot of things we could have a yarn about. And he loves a laugh, so it was really cool.”</p> <p>Two years on from the end of season three, Oly and Santi (Carlos Sanson Jr) are back together, with Santi switching to home-parenting duties. Oly’s free-spirited mum, Angie (Karvan), is living in a protest camp defending trees in an urban strip the mayor wants to remove to make way for affordable housing.</p> <p>“It’s such a complex issue,” says Tisdell, who was in the writer’s room for her storylines. “We had conversations like, ‘Would Shauna be against this destruction of land?’ Of course, she would. But what she has to do as a politician is make the best decision. She’d be frustrated. She’d be angry. Also, [being Indigenous], she would be getting so much hate. So while everybody else would be dealing with normal political stuff, she’d be getting it extra.”</p> <p>For inspiration for the role, her second with a political narrative, after Blackfella Films’ <i>Total Control</i> (the third series of which airs on the ABC in January), Tisdell looked to two political figures.</p> <p>“I fell down this rabbit hole a while ago, getting really interested in in-group/out-group empathy. Gandhi, apparently, was an arsehole, person to person,” she says. “But it’s because he was so focused on the bigger picture. I thought that would be an interesting character to play, regardless of whether we make it clear or not, as an Indigenous woman, what Shauna’s overcome to be at this point in politics.</p> <p>“She does not care who she collects along the way. She’s just got her eye on the prize … She’s someone like Bob Katter. He’s a fool, but I do think that he has his mind made up about what he’s doing, and it’s just poor social skills.”</p> <p>The rapid production pace of <i>Bump</i> was twice that of <i>Total Control</i>.</p> <p>“There are less takes [on <i>Bump]</i>,” she says. “They trust all of the actors, and it meant that they trusted me. But that meant that I had to trust myself, which was really hard, especially when you’re playing a comedy character. When I’m doing stand-up, you know if it’s funny. If it’s on set, nobody’s allowed to laugh … There’s also a big difference between working with blackfellas and working with whitefellas – the slang, the way we talk, the kinds of jokes that we make.”</p> <p>For the second time in her career, Tisdell had a “crazy fangirl reaction”. “The first was when I met Human Nature, and the other was when I met [actor and filmmaker] Angus Sampson [who plays Oly’s dad]. He’s got the most charisma out of anyone I’ve met in my life.”</p> <p>Tisdell’s on-screen taste of the political realm has not sparked real-world ambitions for the former human-rights law student. “I’d need much tougher skin,” she says. “I’m a very soft person. It’s really hard to be a people pleaser as a pollie, and I also think that anybody who should be in politics would never want to be in politics. I prefer using my platform with the arts to tell a story and to move people into thinking differently.”</p> <p><strong><em>Bump</em> returns on Tuesday, December 26, on Stan, which is owned by the owner of this masthead. </strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.</i></b><a href=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p>Deep in the semi-rural Sydney suburb of Terrey Hills, on a film set ringed by muddy paddocks, ramshackle shanty buildings and the cry of peacocks roaming a tropical mini-jungle, actor, writer and director Kick Gurry is fondling a hand grenade.</p> <p>“I like this one,” he says, holding the dark-olive mini-explosive. “It looks mean.”</p> <p>On-set armourer John Bowring, one of the most experienced film weapon experts in Australia with credits including <i>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</i>, <i>The Matrix</i> and <i>Crocodile Dundee</i>, for which he made the famous knife, stands calmly beside him.</p> <p>“This one will roll further,” Bowring says, pulling another dummy grenade from a box. Eyes wide, Gurry mimes pulling the explosive’s ring and chucking it into the jungle-like trees. “And <i>kapow</i>,” he says. “Perfect.”</p> <p>It’s day 18 of filming Stan Original show <em>C*A*U*G*H*T</em>, a six-episode war series telling the tale of four Australian soldiers sent on a secret mission to Behati-Prinsloo, a fictional war-torn island nation, by the Australian minister of defence.</p> <p>Captured by freedom fighters who believe they are Americans, the group create a hostage video that goes viral, giving them celebrity status on social media. But as the world zeroes in, the soldiers learn fame has good and bad sides.<br/><i></i></p> <p><em>C*A*U*G*H*T’</em>s production drew its own level of fame after Hollywood and Oscar-winning actor Sean Penn, intrigued by Gurry’s take on modern celebrity, signed up to play a fictionalised version of himself in the show while doubling as executive producer.</p> <p>US stars Susan Sarandon and Matthew Fox, the latter a friend of Gurry’s, also joined the cast along with a heady list of Australian actors including Ben O’Toole, Lincoln Younes, Alexander England, Mel Jarnson, Fayssal Bazzi, Dorian Nkono, Rebecca Breeds and Bella Heathcote.</p> <p>Bryan Brown plays a green-and-gold tracksuit-wearing prime minister ever-revelling in Australian sporting achievements; Justine Clarke is a doctor; and the Australian minister of defence, who sends the soldiers on their covert mission, is played by Erik Thomson. There are also cameos from real-life TV journalists including Nine’s <i>A Current Affair</i> host Allison Langdon and <i>Today</i> host Karl Stefanovic.</p> <p>Fresh from lying bound and naked in a dirt pit while in character, and striding through the mud in army fatigues and gumboots, Gurry remains amazed <i>C*A*U*G*H*T </i>is a reality. “It’s been unbelievable,” he says. “I truly feel like I’m walking lucidly through a sort of magical childhood fantasy.”</p> <p>Inspired by the “bold and outrageous” stories of Australian films such as <i>Muriel’s Wedding</i>, <i>Strictly Ballroom</i>, and <i>Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</i>, Gurry admits nerves at tackling <i>C*A*U*G*H*T</i> as a first-time director.</p> <p>“I didn’t know if once we got to production I would feel overwhelmed,” he says. “I didn’t know what the change from actor to director was going to be like. But it’s just been a massive exercise in trust. Getting unbelievable actors, getting an unbelievable cinematographer, production designer, costume designer and so forth. Trusting them to be all magnificent, which they have all delivered.</p> <p>“And shooting in this crazy Terrey Hills jungle, the mud, the Sydney storms stopping us shooting, it’s all just been a pretty joyous experience.”</p> <p>It’s also a callback to his childhood.</p> <p>The show’s name is a nod to the titles of the 1970 film, and 1970s-1980s TV series, <em>M*A*S*H</em>, set during the Korean War in the 1950s.</p> <p>“My mum and dad loved <em>M*A*S*H</em>, and so it was really the first show I can remember,” he says. “Me and my brother and sister would do the music every night when it started.</p> <p>“But, essentially, it gave me my first sort of insight into what I loved; drama and heart that made you laugh.” <i>C*A*U*G*H*T’s </i>premise is an exercise in flipping assumptions. Its opening minutes feature a grainy video recording of four dishevelled men in camouflage army clothing in a ramshackle building.</p> <p>“This is Cap,” says one, played by Gurry. “Dylan Fox of the Australian Defence Force. We’ve been captured by rebel forces.”</p> <p>An offscreen figure strikes him with a gun.</p> <p>“Freedom fighters,” Fox says, tearfully correcting his words.</p> <p>His fellow soldiers, weary and filled with fear, stare at the lens.</p> <p>“These are a good people,” fellow captive Rowdy Gaines, played by O’Toole, says. “They just want their own land. They want to be self-determined … please, these people are going to <i>kill us</i>.”</p> <p>As more violence ensues, the footage halts and Allison Langdon appears in a TV studio. “Hopes are fading tonight for four Australian soldiers missing in the island nation of Behati-Prinsloo,” she says, gravely. “A distressing hostage tape went live last night …”</p> <p>Without spoiling the plot<i>,</i> questions swiftly arise about the four captured men; Fox (Gurry), Gaines (O’Toole), Albhanis Mouawad (Lincoln Younes) and Phil Choi (Alexander England).</p> <p>Are they really being held captive? Who are the freedom fighters deciding the foursome’s fate? And what price is the fame they subsequently seek?<br/><i></i></p> <p><i>C*A*U*G*H*T’s </i>satire and drama swings from manic, true-to-life and disconcerting to ridiculous, heart-warming and comic.</p> <p>Producers John and Michael Schwarz (<em>Danger Close: The Battle of Long Tan</em>, <em>Gold</em>) watch filming from amid the trees</p> <p>“The show’s crazy,” Michael says. “It’s obviously satire, which we need more of, but it’s a story that resonates wittily and intelligently to real events and people.”</p> <p>They watch the arrival of a character named The Dingo, played by actor Travis Fimmel, whose outfit conjures memories of an infamous face-painted, fur-hatted figure in the January 6 riots at the US Capitol.</p> <p>Actor Fayssal Bazzi, who plays freedom fighter Director Bustard, says Gurry’s script and generosity in letting him develop his character, got him onboard.</p> <p>“Kick’s got an infectious passion that makes everyone want to do a good job,” he says. “It makes other artists want to come in and see what he’s doing.”</p> <p>Bazzi, known for Apple TV’s <i>Shantaram</i>, ABC’s <i>Stateless</i> and <i></i><i>Mr Inbetween</i>, is also passionate about the show’s spotlight on Western countries’ treatment of less-powerful countries and nations.</p> <p>“The people of Behati-Prinsloo are trying to be their own thing but are being sucked up into a Western machine and dragged through the media,” he says. “The world can be cruel in how it treats smaller nations, just bulldozering them for their own needs and greed.”</p> <p>Rebecca Breeds, a <i>Home and Away</i> alumni whose recent roles include <i>Pretty Little Liars, Clarice</i> and <i>The Brave,</i> plays Josie Justice, a journalist who reports on the soldiers’ plight to reignite her career.</p> <p>She remembers Gurry explaining the idea to her in 2019 when she lived near him in Los Angeles. “I was like, ‘That’s hilarious. I can’t wait to see it’,” she says. “I never imagined, four years later, I’d be in it.”</p> <p>Attracted to the show’s ludicrous, boundary pushing plot, she says it’s a mirror to contemporary society.</p> <p>“If you strip it all back, Kick is making a powerful point about the trappings of fame,” she says. “How our society has become so blinded by notoriety that it doesn’t see what’s right or wrong any more. It’s just, who’s popular? Who’s famous? Who has a name? And then, how can we monetise that?</p> <p>“<i>C*A*U*G*H*T </i>shows characters who all have very real needs and dreams, who are doing the best they can with what’s presented to them at the time.</p> <p>“But at what cost?

       "  'description': '<p>Eastern suburbs media personality <strong>Mia Freedman</strong> has done pretty well for someone whose family became very rich only while she was in high school at Ascham.</p> <p>The entrepreneurial brains behind a vast, widely adored women’s media network, is set to get the small screen treatment, with Foxtel-owned streaming service Binge turning her 2017 memoir into an <strong>Asher Keddie</strong>-led dramedy called <em>Strife</em> – something we’re sure the resident of a $12.75 million Point Piper home knows a thing or two about!</p> <p>Freedman is a co-executive producer on the project, which started filming this week, along with Keddie, and <strong>Steve Hutensky</strong>, a former entertainment lawyer who helped <strong>Harvey Weinstein</strong><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/movies/how-harvey-weinstein-s-lawyer-became-one-of-australia-s-biggest-film-and-tv-producers-20221124-p5c16b.html\" target=\"_blank\"> secure secret settlements</a> with women he’d allegedly sexually harassed.</p> <p>Hutensky is co-founder and chief operating officer of production company Made Up Stories, along with his wife <strong>Bruna Papandrea</strong> (also producing <em>Strife</em>), which prides itself on producing stories with “intelligent, multifaceted female characters” and is the recipient of millions in Screen Australia grants.</p> <p>But in a past life, he spent decades as a Miramax lawyer, and his work for Weinstein earned him the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/05/us/harvey-weinstein-complicity.html\" target=\"_blank\">nickname</a> “the cleaner-upper”. While Hutensky’s work with Weinstein was well documented in American reporting, it’s rarely discussed in a domestic film industry where Made Up Stories is a very big player.</p> <p>While we’re not suggesting Hutensky was involved in any illegal acts, or knew the extent of the allegations against Weinstein (who is now sentenced to 39 years in prison for sexual assault), the whole connection just doesn’t sit well with Freedman’s pop feminist girlboss schtick.</p> <p>Neither Freedman, nor Hutensky responded to CBD’s comment requests.</p> <h3>Murdered on the dancefloor</h3> <p>It’s fair to say <strong>John Barilaro</strong> isn’t taking the Coalition’s weekend election loss too badly, even if he probably wishes he was in New York by now.</p> <p>On Sunday, while many of his former colleagues were off wound-licking, Barra was spotted boogie-ing away to <strong>Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s</strong> <em>Murder on the Dancefloor</em> at lobbyist<strong> Michael Kauter’s</strong> Mosman pad.</p> <p>Kauter, who bought the $9.5 million home with his kidney doctor husband <strong>David Gracey</strong> last year, has been a generous past donor to Barilaro’s Nationals. Now he’s better known as the face behind Strategic Political Counsel, the firm helping another Nats donor, British American Tobacco, in its fight to keep the government away from your vapes.</p> <p>Kauter’s also quite the socialite. Joining Barilaro at the shindig was a rather motley crew, which included conservative pundit and anti-Voice campaigner <strong>Warren Mundine</strong>, heiress<strong> Ros Oatley</strong> and <strong>James Flynn</strong>, a self-described innovator who worked as a campaign advisor to anti-trans crusader <strong>Katherine Deves</strong> during her run in Warringah last year.</p> <h3>Obama no sell-out</h3> <p>When we brought word in November that former US president <b>Barack Obama </b>was coming to town for a couple of speaking engagements, we thought the events would be sell-outs, not least because tickets to <strong>Julia Gillard’s </strong>shows a month earlier were gone within minutes.</p> <p>Back then, it looked like former progressive national leaders were a sure-fire hit for event promoters. Now we’re not so sure.</p> <p>For Obama, it looks like a tale of two cities, with plenty of tickets left for Wednesday night’s show at Melbourne’s John Cain Arena, MC’d by former foreign minister <b>Julie Bishop, </b>where you can still get in for just $195.</p> <p>Things are a little tighter for Tuesday night’s show in Sydney, where there were still plenty of spots available on Monday but mostly at the pricier end of the room, costing upward of $345.</p> <p>Either way, there are plenty of empty seats – and we reckon making your cheapest tickets nearly $200 might have something to do with it.</p> <p>We asked the show’s publicists how they thought things were going.

       "  'headline': 'Remember Blackberry and Y2K? The films exploring tech bros and their woes',\n",
       "  'description': '<p><em>BlackBerry</em>, a movie about the Canadian engineers who invented the first smartphone, is also a movie about movies. The tech bros communicate by swapping favourite lines; they argue over fudged science in Kubrick’s <em>2001</em> or plot points in <em>Blade Runner</em>; they get excited during the afternoon when they know it’s the office movie night. Director Matt Johnson says that a light switched on in his head when he grasped that the tech industry was driven by sci-fi buffs; fact and fiction, he realised, ran in a series of loops. “When the internet first began, the number one thing that you could find was forums about <em>Star Trek</em>,” he says. “So it is no mystery that a bunch of nerds invent a communicator that can talk to anybody – just like the one they saw in their favourite show.”</p> <p>Johnson took his facts from <em>Losing the Signal: the Untold Story of the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry</em> by Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff, a dense business book, but turns the story into a rollicking yarn, spinning between high comedy and elegiac human drama, that was unquestionably the sleeper hit of the last Berlin Film Festival.</p> <p>It is surprising too, in that you realise while watching it how little you know about an object that was once so familiar. The BlackBerry – soon to become known as the CrackBerry, after millions discovered the addictive pleasure of being able to read and send emails from their phones – was the brainchild of Mike Lazaridis and Doug Fregin, best friends from the university town of Waterloo, Ontario. Lazaridis, as quite brilliantly portrayed by comedian Jay Baruchel, is a prematurely grey-haired perfectionist who finds it hard to meet anyone’s eye; Fregin, played by Johnson himself, is outgoing, dorky and bouncing with Tigger-ish enthusiasm. In 1996, they were driving a wrecked car between phone companies, trying to interest them in drawings of their “PocketLink” without much luck.</p> <p>Enter Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton), a reptilian captain of industry looking for a new ship, who found a way to sell their revamped idea. Over not much more than a decade, the BlackBerry became a phenomenon, conquered the world and then lost it again to the victorious Apple. Along the way, Lazaridis became a slick and driven capitalist, the founders’ friendship fractured and, of course, the movie nights stopped as the joy went out of it. The company made a lot of money and lost it again; Lazaridis, bogged down by his original idea, refused to see that current technology was leaving him behind, while Balsillie started doing dodgy deals behind their backs that brought the police to their doors. By 2007, BlackBerry was toast.</p> <p>“It’s interesting because Mike Lazaridis was so far ahead of his time initially,” says Baruchel. “It’s so strange to see someone see where the world is headed at one point in his life and then not see at all where the world is headed later.” Johnson, who is rather Tigger-like himself, jumps in. “Mike was frozen at the moment of his genius! And you know what? I find this happens with famous people as well, musicians who just kind get locked in a reality they created. It’s not that you find it that difficult to see what’s happening, it’s that you find it quite ego-painful, because changing means you basically have to kill off part of yourself.”</p> <p>The three actors with him agree fervently. “Because it’s all hubris to begin with,” says Baruchel. “The kind of person who thinks they can and intends to change the world is some kind of Type A, right? It takes that kind of thing to get there. But that is also what clouds your judgement.”</p> <p>As Lazaridis’s invention was going into production, another manifestation of the new technology was hitting the headlines: the so-called millennium bug. As the turn of the century approached, so did the threat of the world’s computers – which people were only gradually realising now ran everything – stalling when their six-figure date format reached the end of 99, thus running out of numbers.</p> <p><em>Time Bomb Y2K</em>, an archival documentary by Brian Becker and Marley McDonald, draws on newscasts, contemporary interviews and the daily reports by then-president Bill Clinton’s “Y2K tsar” John Koskinen – an earnest, avuncular figure whose delivery immediately calls to mind Anthony Fauci’s COVID briefings – is a surprisingly lively account of a crisis that, once averted, was almost immediately forgotten.</p> <p>What is also forgotten now is the clustering of survivalists, enthusiastic prophets of doom and religious crazies around the enthralling prospect of the end of life as we know it – which seems to be about to meet its demise, the directors suggest, every 20 years or so.</p> <p>“It’s sort of why we’re interested in archival documentaries, looking at history and realising human nature repeats itself in the face of things like this,” says McDonald. “This moment when we were first getting Macs into our homes and office, that realisation that we were already dependent on computers for our technology, feels very specific. But the story of the apocalypse, of course, is as old as the beginning of the world.”</p> <p>Some converts sold their city houses and moved to remote Ozarks to grow vegetables; another seemingly ordinary family barricaded themselves into a heavily armed compound. Television evangelists quoted warnings of Y2K in the Book of Revelation with a show of triumph. “I think there is sort of hope of change in the world where people see these crises as a vacuum that they can fill with their worldviews and ideas,” McDonald says. “The apocalypse is attractive in that it gives us the opportunity to start anew.”</p> <p>Best of all, it was not entirely imaginary. “It was this perfect conflation of factors where it gave this very real deadline birthed out of technological necessity to individuals who wanted to attach their worldviews to this potentially existential threat,” says Becker. If the story of BlackBerry is like a miniature portrait of the tech boom – with an inbuilt bust – <em>Time Bomb Y2K</em> is a macro snapshot of the way computer technology has become integral to our way of life, including the way we panic.</p> <p>The film, scheduled to be screened by HBO in December, has been doing the rounds of film festivals since March. When they first screened it, McDonald says, most of the audience questions were about crisis management and the parallels people saw with COVID. “It’s been an interesting arc,” she says. “It didn’t premiere that long ago, but we’ve seen that morph now into questions about AI, this other existential threat we’re grappling with.”</p> <p>What we truly fear is that we are already living in a world belonging to HAL, the rebel computer in <em>2001</em>: <em>A Space Odyssey</em> that sees and takes an opportunity to rid itself of human control. “But HAL was always here. He’s just more vocal now,” says Matt Johnson, sparking another all-in discussion between his actors.</p> <p>“We often complain our phones are listening to us, asking how is it that we are discussing furniture with a friend and suddenly our phone is trying to sell us furniture,” says Cary Elwes, who plays Palm CEO Carl Yankowski in <em>BlackBerry</em>. He remembers reading that biologists warned that our spines would start to curve because we spend so much time hunched over.</p> <p>“But I think we are also, as a species, fascinated by technology or we wouldn’t have so many devices,” he muses. “So there is this strange love-hate relationship. At what point do we lose control?” It’s a question only a machine could answer.</p> <p><strong><em>BlackBerry</em> screens at Melbourne International Film Festival on August 4, Comedy Theatre, 9.15pm and August 9 at The Capitol, 9pm. <em>Time Bomb</em> <em>Y2K</em> screens August 5 at ACMI 1, at 6.45pm and August 7 at Kino 1, at 6.15pm.

       "  'headline': 'This parody of true-crime documentaries playfully blurs fact and fiction',\n",
       "  'description': '<p><strong><em>Paul T. Goldman</em></strong><br/><strong>★★★★</strong><br/><strong>Stan*, June 15</strong></p> <p><em>Paul T. Goldman</em>, which aired in the US in January, is a multilayered parody of true-crime documentaries, one that folds in on itself like a balled sock swallowing another sock. It’s exploitation TV that playfully blurs the lines between fact and fiction and its real-life titular subject, the hero of his own delusions, is its poor preening chump.</p> <p>The series’ backstory is convoluted. Goldman is the author of <em>Duplicity</em>, a true-crime memoir that spins the tale of his own experience being duped, and financially fleeced, by Audrey, a woman he married within weeks of meeting. Goldman, who self-published the book, also turned it into a screenplay, which he’d been shipping around Hollywood (he tweeted at every director he could think of), grand visions of Oscars glory in his eyes. It met radio silence before it found its way to director Jason Woliner, who must’ve rubbed his hands in glee that such a doofus fell into his lap.</p> <p>After 10 years of work, Woliner’s conjured up something remarkable with Goldman’s script (if not the Oscar-winning film Goldman originally envisioned): a six-episode series that is part documentary and part true-crime parody, in which Goldman narrates his own story of woe to the camera while also awkwardly starring in elaborately staged reenactments of his mishaps alongside professional actors including Frank Grillo and James Remar. But the early revelation that Goldman’s real name is actually Paul Finkelman - he changed it to sound cooler - is a hint that maybe the full story isn’t 100 per cent as he relays it (“97 per cent … approximately,” Finkelman offers).</p> <p>Woliner was the director of <em>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm</em> and various episodes of Nathan Fielder’s <em>Nathan For You</em>, and <em>Paul T. Goldman</em> shares their DNA - mostly in its ethically dubious reliance on a guileless rube to drive its comic engine. But, like Sacha Baron Cohen’s targets, <em>Paul T. Goldman</em> might get away with it due to the subject’s own needy opportunism. If it’s cruel exploitation, well, he brought it on himself.</p> <p>Finkelman is a compelling figure. He’s frantic in real-life, and bug-eyed and delusional in his hammy acting. “He’s kinda like a kid,” says one of the professional actors tasked to be in a scene with him. “It’s like if my son, you just put him here and, you know…” He’s got a touch of the Larry Davids about him, but the onscreen persona of Larry David, not the Emmy-winning multi-millionaire comedian who lives in luxury in Pacific Palisades. That Larry David’s a winner; Paul Finkelman is not a winner. He’s a chump with a trusting heart, an overzealous libido bordering on misogynistic, and a darker edge than the “aw shucks” attitude he puts across.</p> <p>A scene in episode two - after Finkelman, during a break while shooting a re-enactment about Audrey’s betrayal, reveals to his fellow actors that he’d also been duped by another business partner years ago who fleeced him out of his paint company - sums up the series’ discomfiting mood. Woliner cuts to an interview with Finkelman’s father and stepmother, who dissect their son’s problem: “Unfortunately, he’s vulnerable, because of the fact that he trusts everybody and can’t believe anybody would do these things to him. He’s too good a person, and these things happen to him,” says his dad. “I don’t think somebody could pull the wool over his eyes again, I don’t think so,” adds his stepmum. At which point the action cuts away to Woliner on set, directing this whole bogus enterprise, who shoos the camera away with a sly glint in his eye.</p> <p>But as Finkelman’s story takes a turn to the increasingly unhinged (wave a red flag for the words “international sex trafficking ring”) and the show becomes a timely allegory for conspiracy theory - the way someone who’s down might concoct a self-empowering fantasy narrative as a substitute for their own real-world impotence - Woliner pulls back, his conscience seemingly getting the better of him. It’s an empathetic response, but one that costs the series its teeth.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/tv-and-radio/ethically-it-s-questionable-jury-duty-s-accidental-hero-opens-up-on-tv-experiment-20230510-p5d79v.html\" target=\"_blank\">ongoing debate</a> about the ethics of cringe comedy and the cruelty involved in milking everyday dolts for our comic enjoyment, it’s odd seeing the humane response play out. In <em>Paul T. Goldman</em> the final turn is so unsatisfying that you’re left wondering how Finkelman convinced Woliner to make an entire series out of his unremarkable nonsense with himself centre-screen. But, in the end, it feels like a fitting grift.</p> <p><strong>* Stan is owned by Nine, as is this masthead.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.</i></b><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'headline': 'The scariest thing this anarchic playwright has written? A classic play',\n",
       "  'description': '<p>Ash Flanders has built a career around theatrical anarchy, tearing down the old guard with heaping helpings of nudity, mud, slime, high camp and low humour. But his latest offering ventures down a path even he has always found too terrifying to face. <em>This Is Living</em> is a naturalistic five-act play in which relatable characters talk about the feelings. “It’s very earnest,” he says. “I have to be OK with that.”</p> <p>Earnest? What the Flanders? This is a guy known for period dramas on psychedelics, queer dismantlings of straight theatre, and erotic <em>Golden Girls</em> fan fiction. The performer and playwright’s work has always been about taking risks – the scarier the better. What could be more perilous than trying to pull off characters audiences will actually become emotionally invested in?</p> <p>“I thought the scariest thing I could try and do is actually write a conservative form, a five-act dramatic play, a play with a capital P. It’s not meta, it doesn’t comment on itself, it doesn’t dissolve into something, it doesn’t evolve into something else. It is what it is, which is a classic play. I thought that would be really hard to do.”</p> <p>Flanders’ moment of revelation came when he was watching another play. On paper, it sounds like exactly the thing he once made fun of: a family in a kitchen talking about real-world stuff. “I felt like I hadn’t seen that in forever. I was like, wow. I actually like this genre of play. Maybe I like it because I’m old now. But this actually feels like the edgiest thing to do right now.”</p> <p>Flanders is 42, and the passage of time has furnished him with life experiences a younger playwright would have had to concoct. “I don’t have to invent crazy situations because honestly, my real life at the moment is proving very ripe. And again, it’s risky to share that. It’s scary.”</p> <p>Not as scary as the drama that underscores <em>This Is Living</em>. In 2020 his partner was diagnosed with a fatal illness. It was confirmed on a Thursday, and by the following Monday he was in hospital starting chemo. Then came another hiccup. “Dan got sick, and then the world got sick and COVID shut down everything.”</p> <p>Daniel was in the Alfred Hospital when one of the first COVID clusters was discovered. “It was in his room, the person sharing his room. So then Daniel was in the infectious disease ward for months. He couldn’t come home in between rounds of chemo, and then the chemo wasn’t doing what he needed it to, so he ended up needing a full bone marrow transplant.”</p> <p>Throughout the ordeal that followed, what most shocked Flanders was how illness can test a relationship. “I always thought that cancer brings a couple together. I thought when there’s a tragedy it bonds you. But actually, there was now this whole part of Daniel that I couldn’t understand. No matter how much I tried to be there for him, he was in a place I couldn’t access anymore.”</p> <p>A sickness in a relationship, Flanders says, is like a new lover in the room. “Everything becomes about whether you’re acknowledging it or denying it, with everything you say. All you want to talk about is the sickness and what your fears are, but you don’t want to burden the sick person … So it becomes a real nightmare of trying to be the person that you think they want you to be, and what I thought Dan wanted me to be wasn’t actually what Dan needed.”</p> <p>It wasn’t just them. Flanders saw things in the cancer ward that were a long way from the Hollywood version of illness. “I saw people yelling at the sick person. I saw people being bullied by the sick person. I saw the sick person controlling the doctors. It’s a lot more complicated than just the healthy person takes care of the sick person … Everyone’s doing their best, but there are a lot of primal feelings of rage and anger and hurt and lashing out.”</p> <p>At this point it’s worth noting <em>This Is Living</em> is a comedy. It’s inspired by a New Year’s getaway Flanders and Dan took with three female friends a few months after the diagnosis. They’re straight, single, child-free women in their early 50s, he says, and conventional theatre just hasn’t known what to do with those characters. “There are some very fabulous women who don’t get acknowledged or celebrated by the world at large. It makes me kind of insane. I like to be around hysterical, outrageous, cutting women.</p> <p>“One of the things I’ve come to realise about why I love the dynamic so much is that nothing’s off limits. We make fun of everyone all the time. But they also really check in and make sure you’re doing OK. There’s a listening that’s deeper than I’ve found with friends my own age.”</p> <p>These women might share Flanders’ love of irony and barbed humour, but it’s in the service of genuine care. “They want to address the elephants in the room and laugh about it and tease each other mercilessly. But there’s still this deep love. And it really feels like it’s a chosen family thing. They might not have partners or children, and we’re not their children or partners, but there’s an intimacy that we share that is familial.”</p> <p>These are some of the most important relationships in Flanders’ life, but the complex bonds between gay men and single older women are something he has never seen depicted on stage. If the play is earnest, it’s because he wants to honour the kind of relationship that the young firebrand Flanders hadn’t lived long enough to experience. And it’s a comedy “because the people it’s based on are hilarious.”</p> <p>Is he afraid that some young punk will give <em>This Is Living</em> the same kind of send-up he once directed at mainstage plays? “I would love that. I think that’s the young person’s job … I really hope that young people make fun of me for it. It’s weird if they don’t. This show is easy to make fun of. But it’s easy to make fun of because it’s real.</p> <p>“I really want you to care about these people who I love. I really want you to understand what the storyline of cancer can do to a relationship. And there’s not going to be trapdoors and slime and a play eating itself. What’s there is just how hard life is.”</p> <p><strong><em>This Is Living</em> is at Malthouse Theatre from July 12. </strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><a href=\"https://web-editing-smh.platform.ink/link/follow-20170101-p56jp0\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p><strong>BOTTOMS</strong> ★★★★</p> <p><strong>(MA15+) 92 minutes</strong></p> <p>Best friends PJ (Rachel Sennott) and Josie (Ayo Edebiri) are the “ugly, untalented gays” at Rockbridge Falls High School. When a miscommunication evolves into a lie about their purported violent past in juvenile detention, the two concoct a wild plan to start a women’s fight club under the guise of self-defence, to get close to their cheerleader crushes and lose their virginity.</p> <p>The plan accidentally works, and as they begin to form real connections, the lie snowballs and PJ and Josie are forced to face the consequences of their actions.</p> <p>Like a lot of Gen Z culture, <em>Bottoms – </em>which is co-written by Sennott and Emma Seligman, who also directs – moves fast, and is largely focused on being funny. It’s a high school satire and there are moments of commentary on issues such as violence against women and homophobia, but it’s completely driven by the comedy. Even when it comes to social commentary, the clearest nods lie in the movie’s edgiest jokes. One joke about assault – “grey-area stuff” – is delivered with such direct assuredness by Sennott, it made me gasp with laughter.</p> <p>That dark humour many queer people and women use to cope is shown perfectly. They are not jokes for a joke’s sake, nor are they written just to offend or shock. They are written from a place of experience. It allows the perspective and power situation to feel right, and allows dark stuff to be really, really funny.</p> <p>At the heart of <em>Bottoms</em>, though, is its silliness. The plot falls apart a bit toward the end in service of raising the stakes to the moon, but I didn’t mind. It takes big swings, and commits hard to the absurd.</p> <p>The performances are beautifully played across the board. Edebiri, who is well-known from breakout TV hit <em>The Bear</em>, is a standout, displaying so much on her face and in her physicality. Her chemistry with the more direct and deadpan Sennott is a delight. Havana Rose Liu, who plays Edeberi’s love interest Isabel, impressed with her grounded deliveries<b>,</b> while Nicholas Galitzine is hilarious as popular quarterback Jeff.</p> <p>A gonzo teen movie might not sound like something that should feel important in 2023, but it did to me. Queer people do not have a history of being able to make mainstream, silly movies. Even our modern <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/movies/queer-rom-com-has-all-the-christmas-trimmings-except-for-sparkling-wit-20201126-p56i44.html\" target=\"_blank\">Christmas romcoms</a> have to be about a difficult and stressful coming-out story.</p> <p><i>Bottoms</i> is more concerned with being funny than being funny to every person. There are tonal moments and jokes that feel refreshing because it is committed to its unique brand of comedy, rather than trying to appeal to the masses.</p> <p>I am still not entirely used to watching movies that cater to queer audiences, it still doesn’t happen that often. But the fact that we have progressed so many queer teens can now just deal with the normal horrors and awkwardness of being a teenager is beautiful. <em>Bottoms</em> is fast, funny, ironic and self-aware. It’s deranged. It may not be for everyone, but that’s OK.</p> <p><strong><em>Bottoms</em> is released in cinemas on November 30. </strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.</i></b><a href=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p><strong>HAUNTED MANSION</strong> ★★½<br/><strong>(PG) 123 minutes</strong></p> <p>If you look close enough, you might spy phantoms lurking in the background of <em>Haunted Mansion</em>, the second family-friendly horror comedy to be inspired by the Disneyland ride of the same name, following the 2003 version with Eddie Murphy, which I assume is long forgotten even by dedicated fans.</p> <p>In every version of this material, the mansion is said to be in the French Quarter of New Orleans, suggesting the ride’s original designers took inspiration from the real world’s similarly located <a href=\"https://neworleanshistorical.org/items/show/1492\" target=\"_blank\">LaLaurie mansion</a>, haunted in legend by the ghosts of murdered slaves.</p> <p>Making that connection explicit wouldn’t be the Disney way, but it’s not by chance the 2003 <em>Haunted Mansion</em> involved Murphy’s character reuniting the spirits of a persecuted interracial couple. Nor does it seem likely any of this history was lost on director Justin Simien when he signed on for this loose remake, thinking back to his 2013 campus satire <em>Dear White People</em>, later adapted into a successful Netflix series.</p> <p>In this context, there’s something especially suggestive about the casting of LaKeith Stanfield, whose air of grounded paranoia recalls his roles in <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/get-out-review-a-new-era-of-black-horror-films-begins-20170502-gvwyr7.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Get Out</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/get-out-review-a-new-era-of-black-horror-films-begins-20170502-gvwyr7.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Get Out</em></a>, which tackled the subject of racism past and present in a satirical yet eerie manner, hinting that America could be seen as one big haunted house.</p> <p>Stanfield plays Ben, a griefstricken astrophysicist turned tour guide whose scientific skills come in handy for photographing the ghosts of Gracey Manor, home to widowed doctor Gabbie (Rosario Dawson) and her young son Travis (Chase W. Dillon), a bright misfit who can’t understand why other kids don’t like him despite his efforts to dress well.</p> <p>Gradually, they’re joined by a whole gang of further misfits, including Tiffany Haddish as a brash but insecure medium, Danny DeVito as a classical scholar (a first, I think) and Owen Wilson as a possibly fraudulent priest.</p> <p>Further celebrity guest appearances follow, not all of them strictly necessary to the plot, which is generally disjointed and confusing. Towards the climax, the whole cast decamps for a second haunted mansion, which really does seem like too much of a good thing.</p> <p>It also seems like a sure sign of a script tinkered with by many hands, although the credits identify just one writer, Katie Dippold. Whatever she or anyone else originally had in mind, no central theme emerges beyond a blandly generalised one about moving on from the past, which is to say that overtly at least, this <em>Haunted Mansion</em> plays it even safer than its 2003 predecessor.</p> <p>Still, Simien doesn’t entirely fail: he hardly could with this cast, apparently let loose to improvise around the digital set-pieces. Whenever there’s a lull, Haddish jumps in to take over, while Wilson supplies the same kind of amused running commentary he did in the 1999 version of <em>The Haunting</em>, another movie I thought had been wholly forgotten.</p> <p>Stanfield’s Ben is a different kind of distanced observer, visibly perplexed not just by his encounters with the supernatural but by the absurdity of existence in general: an emotional monologue about the death of his wife is played completely straight, and edited as if no one quite knew what to do with it.</p> <p>For an actor to stay focused amid so many distractions is a feat in itself. But Stanfield has his own special form of intentness, with his guarded stance and his eyes alive with thought, as if searching for something in the movie that isn’t there.</p> <p><strong><em>Haunted Mansion</em> is released in cinemas on August 31. </strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.</i></b><a href=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p>When the pandemic hit back in April 2020, Bret Easton Ellis remembers being bored and uninspired. “I wasn’t able to leave my apartment, so I went on YouTube and started listening to Blondie and a bunch of other bands from the 1980s,” the 58-year-old novelist explains from his home in Los Angeles.</p> <p>“That got me thinking about hanging out with my old friends during the last year of high school, which led me to write the first few pages of <a href=\"https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/book/Bret-Easton-Ellis-Shards-9781800752450/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Shards</em></a>.”</p> <p>Ellis is the narrator and central protagonist of his first novel in 13 years, which was serialised on his weekly podcast <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/breteastonellispodcast\" target=\"_blank\">The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast</a> over the course of 2022. Set in L.A. in the autumn of 1981, the plot unfolds in tandem with the murky movements of a mysterious, handsome, and charismatic young man Robert Mallory, who suddenly enters the author’s close-knit gang of friends at Buckley: a prep school for the entitled offspring of wealthy west-coast elites. Mallory’s arrival coincides at a time when several brutal, gruesome murders have just been committed across the San Fernando Valley, by a serial killer nicknamed The Trawler.</p> <p>“This novel became a mash-up of everything I have written since my debut novel, <em>Less than Zero</em> (1985); there is the relationship elements of<em> Rules of Attraction</em> (1987); the serial killer angle from <em>American Psycho</em> (1991); the parties with celebrities, which you can also see in <em>Glamorama</em> (1998); the autofiction style of <em>Lunar Park</em> (2005); and you also get a flavour of the gothic haunted-house narrative from<em> Imperial Bedrooms</em> (2010).”</p> <p><em>The Shards</em> also sees the cult American author return to one of his signature stylistic literary tropes: celebrating opulent luxury with unapologetic self-indulgence. Take Susan Reynolds, for example. “A prototype of the cool SoCal girl, [she] wears Wayfarer sunglasses and drives a convertible BMW [and is] always mildly stoned on marijuana or Valium or half a Quaalude,” is how Ellis describes one of the novel’s minor characters.</p> <p>Like many of his previous books, <em>The Shards</em> is littered with tedious descriptions of luxury perfumes, fancy shampoo bottles, and designer clothes. It isn’t meant to be a postmodernist critique of late-20th-century capitalism, though, the author insists. “I like writing about those products,” Ellis explains matter-of-factly. “My friends would wear Ralph Lauren cologne and polo shirts. It’s not a form of intellectual irony.”</p> <p>What, then, is the point of these suave, stylish passages? Are they subtly promoting surface-level superficiality? Or is Ellis’ literary prose expressing an unspoken raging nihilism, which only the super wealthy and obscenely privileged could only ever truly understand?</p> <p>“What about the nihilism of the poor, though?” Ellis snaps back. “Poor people are just as nihilistic as rich people. They’re not given angelic grace just because they are simply poor,” he says. “I mean the crime rates? The gang violence? The shootings? The sheer nihilism of that. People talk about the nihilism of the rich and educated? It’s nothing, nothing, compared to the nihilism that is expressed in hip hop, in rap, in urban centres across the [United States.]”</p> <p>Ellis is off on one. But he does, after all, have a reputation for courting public controversy and gladly assumes the role as a provocateur in the culture war. Five years ago, the author issued a written public apology in <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/dear-kathryn-bigelow-bret-easton-ellis-is-really-sorry\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dear Kathryn Bigelow: Bret Easton Ellis Is Really Sorry</em> \\xa0</a>after insulting American filmmaker, Kathryn Bigelow. “[She] would be considered mildly interesting if she was a man but since she’s a very hot woman she’s really overrated,” Ellis tweeted.</p> <p>In his 2019 book of essays <em>White</em> the author expressed his outrage at politically correct liberal America. “I was going to call the book <em>Privileged White Male</em>, because that is what I am,” he says. “But this identity tag has become for many the epitome of evil.”</p> <p>Some critics pointed to the book’s most illuminating theme: visceral anger. “I wrote the book during 2018, at a moment when everybody was angry,” Ellis admits. “I’m so not there anymore.”</p> <p>Born in L.A. in 1964 into a well-off family, Ellis wears his Gen X identity tag as a badge of honour. “We lived in the most profane, offensive time when you could say whatever you wanted and nobody cared,” he says.</p> <p>Millennials, by contrast, are a bunch of attention-seeking, whining cry-babies, who always play the victim card, the author claims. “These people believe anyone who disagrees with them should be cancelled. Oh, the horror, the horror,” he says, breaking into convulsions of laughter. “It’s absurd. I’ve been cancelled three times. For my Twitter account. For <em>White</em>. And for writing <em>American Psycho</em>.”</p> <p>The controversial 1991 cult novel (which later became a successful movie) describes the life of a New York narcissist, Patrick Bateman. By day, he works as Wall Street investment banker. By night, he drinks his own urine and roams the streets of Manhattan looking for women he can slash the throats of. One reviewer in <em>The New York Times</em> described the book as “a gratuitous degradation of human life, of women in particular”.</p> <p>“The critics are all wrong,” says Ellis. “Depiction of misogyny is not an act of misogyny. <em>American Psycho</em> became my quest to understand Patrick Bateman’s madness.”</p> <p>Ellis was then in his late 20s, living a carefree hedonistic lifestyle in Manhattan. He didn’t care what the American literary establishment thought about him, or his books. “I wasn’t worried about my career,” he says. “I just wanted to have sex. I was really into drugs, and I liked to go to clubs.”</p> <p>Back then a coke binge could go on for four days straight. But Ellis insists that he was always back at his desk early Monday morning to knuckle down to what he did best: writing fiction. “The coke years were roughly from 1988 to 2002,” says Ellis. “Writing was more fun than doing coke, so when I moved back to L.A. I stopped.”</p> <p>“I’m now 58,” says Ellis philosophically. “The thought of going out and doing coke makes me nauseous. I like a nice wine. The occasional cocktail. If I can’t sleep, an Ativan.

       "  'description': '<p>I’m not old enough to have watched <i>Candid Camera </i>when it was being made in black and white. But I remember watching it in colour in the 1980s. By then into its fourth decade, the show was still hosted by the tireless prankster Allen Funt, who would eke out the new content by rebroadcasting grainy black-and-white clips from the show’s classic era.</p> <p>One of these vintage clips came on frequently, and I always dreaded its reappearance. It showed a guy in advanced middle age working on a cake assembly line. He wore a short-sleeved shirt and tie. His trousers were protected by a poignant-looking apron. As the conveyor belt gradually sped up, cakes began slipping past him and tumbling to the floor. With dignity but mounting panic, the frazzled senior scrambled to deal with the unfolding disaster.</p> <p>As a youngster, I wasn’t generally troubled by the ethics of <i>Candid Camera</i>. But there was something about this particular stunt that didn’t feel right. For a start, the guy looked way too old, and way too overdressed, to be taking work in a cake factory. He looked like Spencer Tracy, or possibly Spiro Agnew.</p> <p>Had he recently been retrenched? Was he working a second job to feed his family? Was he gutted when Funt informed him that he had not, after all, secured employment in the pastry field? To subtract from the fun even further, it was hard to avoid the suspicion that a guy who had been that old that long ago was now almost certainly dead.</p> <p>If the cake man were pranked on TV today, there would be no need to worry about his welfare. He could spend the rest of his life riding a geyser of monetisation opportunities. He could become an influencer with his own line of oldster energy drinks. But when he was punked by Funt in the 1950s, the original cake man vanished back into obscurity, having presumably signed a release form and received a modest cheque.</p> <p><i>Candid Camera</i> began its long TV run in 1948. The show made such a splash that its title entered the vernacular. People still say “Am I on <i>Candid Camera</i>?” when they feel as if they’ve fallen victim to a vast, Kafkaesque stitch-up. If we ever catch ourselves thinking that reality TV is a recent invention, it’s worth recalling that the genre is as old as <i>Candid Camera</i>, which means it’s almost as old as TV itself.</p> <p>The wickedly clever <i>Jury Duty</i>, currently showing on Prime Video, is at one level the most fantastically elaborate candid camera prank ever pulled. But there are elements of <i>Big Brother</i> and <i>The Truman Show</i> in the mix too, and dashes of improvised comedy reminiscent of <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> and <i>This Is Spinal Tap</i>.</p> <p>None of the show’s basic ingredients is original in itself. But there is alchemy in the way they’ve been combined. A lot of clever TV is being made these days, but you rarely feel that you’re watching something entirely new. I had that feeling watching <i>Jury Duty</i>.</p> <p>Except for one cast member, everybody involved in making <i>Jury Duty</i> knew they were participating in a colossal hoax. The exception was Ronald Gladden, the show’s unwitting star. In 2021, Ronald was 29 years old, and between jobs, when he responded to an ad on Craigslist, purportedly placed by the producers of a forthcoming TV documentary. Claiming to have obtained permission to make a behind-the-scenes doco about a real-life LA court case, the producers were seeking applicants to fill the jury pool.</p> <p>So Ronald applied to sit as a juror on what he believed to be a real trial. He knew he would be on camera; he just didn’t know he would be on candid camera. He thought the other jurors were in the same boat as himself. In reality, they were all actors.</p> <p>So was everybody else involved in the case: the plaintiff and the defendant, their lawyers, the judge. Using their improv skills, the actors steered Ronald into a succession of bizarre situations dreamed up by the show’s creators, Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, who previously worked as writer-producers on the US version of <i>The Office</i>.</p> <p>Over 2,500 people responded to the ad that launched the <i>Jury Duty</i> hoax. When the producers found Ronald Gladden among the applicants, they must have known they’d hit the jackpot. Ronald is the show’s tentpole. If he’d been a flake or a quitter, he could have brought the whole production crashing down at any time. If he’d been less nice – if the show’s contrived situations had revealed him to be a hypocrite or sleazeball – the project would have become an ethical nightmare for the producers, and a sour experience for the viewer.</p> <p>But Ronald is a freakishly decent person. He’s a type familiar from literature. He’s like Candide, or Hans Castorp, or the naïve heroes of Evelyn Waugh. He’s the wide-eyed straightperson at the centre of the comic storm.</p> <p>The comedy is generated by the troupe of weirdos he’s forced to rub shoulders with. It can’t have been easy for the show’s producers to fill these weirdo parts. For one thing, they had to be careful not to cast any actor whose face Ronald would recognise from TV or the movies.</p> <p>As well as being obscure, the actors surrounding Ronald had to be unusually good at thinking on their feet. They had to stay in character around him all the time, even when the cameras weren’t rolling. A single dodgy performance might have made him smell a rat.</p> <p>But how do you sell a show with no recognisable actors in it? This is where the creators of <i>Jury Duty</i> had their canniest flash of inspiration. They hired the movie star James Marsden to enter the jury pool as himself, or a distorted version of himself. After all, the fake trial was happening in LA, so it wasn’t implausible that a real-life celebrity would have been called up for jury duty too.</p> <p>Marsden is exactly the right size of star to make this gag work. He’s not quite a household name, but he’s a household face. When Ronald meets him for the first time, he knows he’s seen him in <i>something</i>, but can’t remember what. Only after Googling him does he realise he’s the guy from <i>The Notebook</i> – not Ryan Gosling, but the other guy.</p> <p>Marsden has told interviewers that he did, at one point, have ethical qualms about what he and the rest of the cast were doing to Ronald. “We’re fooling this guy for three weeks of his life?” he remembered thinking. “I started questioning the morality of this.”</p> <p>You can see why Marsden was reassured once he got to know Ronald. The man is surreally unflappable. This is good news for the viewer too, since we’re as complicit in Ronald’s duping as Marsden was. Long before the final episode, we know Ronald well enough to know that he won’t spit the dummy or fall apart when he’s told the whole thing has been one giant scam. He’s just not that kind of guy.</p> <p><i>Jury Duty</i> works as a broad comedy. But it’s also psychologically revealing, as good reality TV always is. It shows us how much a human being can be made to swallow, especially when there are TV cameras around. “I’d like to think I pick up on things and I’m pretty intuitive but they all fooled me,” Ronald reflects in the last episode.</p> <p>But Ronald has no call to think himself unusually gullible. Human beings are naturally trusting animals. If we didn’t have a hardwired tendency to believe others, and to obey authority figures, human societies would never have got off the ground.</p> <p>Part of the fun of watching Ronald swallow the bait lies in wondering if we’d have swallowed it ourselves. It’s hard to be sure we wouldn’t have. These days the world is so full of shakedown artists that most of us have been conned, or half-conned, at least once. Even if we’ve never been persuaded to part with any cash, we know how easily a talented grifter can slip under our guard.</p> <p>But the field is getting crowded, and our guards are more fully engaged than they’ve ever been before. These days a scam has to be very creative, and very new, to catch us out.</p> <p>This goes for TV pranks too. For a long time, Sacha Baron Cohen mined rich seams of material by tricking interviewees into believing he was Ali G, or Borat, or Bruno. But finally these characters became too well-known to keep fooling people, and Baron Cohen had to retire them one by one. Nowadays, he’s so famous that his ability to work undercover has surely been blown for good.</p> <p>Similarly, the high-profile punking of Ronald Gladden means that nobody is likely to fall for any fake documentary scam on such a scale again, at least in a courtroom setting. The makers of Jury Duty must have known, as they lured Ronald into their trap, that their glorious idea was only ever going to work once, if at all. It’s hard to see how they could have made it work any better.</p> <p><b>To read more from</b><b><i> Spectrum</i></b><b>, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/spectrum-smh-hog\" target=\"_blank\">visit our page here</a>.</b></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56jp0\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p>At the beginning of backstage musical <i>42nd Street</i>, a hopeful young ingénue named Peggy arrives in New York with the dream of making it on Broadway. Things don’t go as planned, but at the last minute a star of a big new show is injured. Peggy steps in at the last minute and saves the day.</p> <p>And so it was for the very young theatre director Riley Spadaro who, last November, had just overseen <i>The Italians </i> at Belvoir St Theatre.</p> <p>Unbeknownst to him, actor Paul Capsis, possessor of five Helpmann Awards, saw a performance.</p> <p>“I guess he had a religious experience at the theatre,” Spadaro recalls with a laugh. “He really liked it!”</p> <p>Three weeks later a producer called. It was Spadaro’s <i>42nd Street</i> moment. A revival of a much different iconic backstage musical, <i>La Cage aux Folles</i>, was underway, with Capsis himself starring. But circumstances had caused their director to drop out. They’d been in rehearsals for four days. “Are you available?” the producer asked. “Paul Capsis wants you to direct the show.”</p> <p>And so the 26-year-old, a partner in a self-described “big gay theatre company” that goes by the proudly lower-cased name of bud, but still plying a day job doing marketing for an ed-tech startup, took on the biggest challenge of his short career.</p> <p>It’s a full-blown classic Broadway musical, one that contains big songs and bigger emotions, and is a touchstone for the emergence of gay culture in the West over the last half century.</p> <p>“As much as it’s seen as this big brassy show,” Spadaro notes, “I do think it’s very political, and very artful. And there’s a real open-heartedness about it.”</p> <p><i>La Cage aux Folles</i> was first a French play, and then a French movie, way back in 1978. The story follows the travails of a drag show impresario, Georges, who is in a long-term relationship with his ensemble’s intemperate and overdramatic star, Albin, stage name Zaza.</p> <p>The day-to-day chaos ramps up into general hysteria when Georges’ son from a long-ago heterosexual relationship brings home first a fiancée, and then her very conservative parents. Hijinks ensue as the couple try to present an appearance of normality, until, of course, their own normality reasserts itself.</p> <p>The film, unexpectedly, found a growing and then ecstatic audience around the world in 1979. (It is often said to have been the highest grossing foreign film in America to that time.) The implicit moral – why do Georges and Albin have to adjust to be someone else’s “normal”? – resonated.</p> <p>Then came a stage show, with big old-fashioned Broadway tunes by Jerry Herman, who’d written the songs for <i>Hello, Dolly</i><em>!</em> and <i>Mame</i>. The book was by Harvey Fierstein. (Fierstein, now known for his outlandish drag roles delivered with his distinctive raspy voice, was at the time a newly minted Broadway star with the success of his play <i>Torch Song Trilogy</i>.)</p> <p>Their musical, directed by the legendary Arthur Laurents, who wrote <i>West Side Story</i> and directed the original <i>Gypsy,</i> swept the Tony Awards that year. The show played in Sydney and Melbourne for nearly a year. (In the 1990s, celebrated film director Mike Nichols produced a US film version, <i>The Birdcage</i>, starring Robin Williams and Nathan Lane.)</p> <p>The musical hit Broadway around the same time the AIDS crisis was spreading around the world. Laurents, Sparados notes, “wanted to make sure hetero couples coming to theatre would have an excellent time but also leave changed.”</p> <p>Actor Todd McKenney has performed in the show twice – once, in a smaller part in the show’s original ’80s edition and then taking on the flamboyant Albin role some years later. “It was the most thrilling experience I’ve ever had,” he recalls.</p> <p>The world in which the original <i>La Cage</i> was staged was not always a friendly one. “It was definitely a ground-breaking show, it really was,” McKenney says. “When we did the original one, it did ok. But there was quite a bit of negative press about our show. I forget which paper but someone wrote, ‘Be careful what glasses you drink out of when you go to the theatre.’”</p> <p>Today, in urban areas, at least, gay culture is mainstream, but, as many transgender youth can tell you, intolerance, and hate, is ever-present beneath the surface. <i>La Cage aux Folles</i>, then as now, reminds us that there are real people being themselves at the other end of that hate.</p> <p>“At its heart,” says Spadaro, “it’s about love and joy and living authentically as one’s true self.”</p> <p>He says he draws inspiration from a passage in Laurents’ memoir. “I think I can remember it exactly,” Spadaro says: “‘Do the work for the sheer pleasure of doing the work. And if you can be proud of the result, you’ve succeeded no matter what happens.’ That’s been my north star.”</p> <p><strong><i>La Cage aux Folles </i>is at the State Theatre April 19 to 23.</strong></p> <p><b><i>A cultural guide to going out and loving your city.</i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=culture-fix\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>Sign up to our Culture Fix newsletter here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

This is followed by a scene where Sheridan appears distressed, holding their head and crumpling sheet music, symbolizing the pressure and scrutiny they faced regarding their personal life.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to Sheridan walking down a staircase with journalist Tara Brown. Sheridan talks about their time at NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art) in Sydney, recalling how past students would return and share their experiences. They mention enjoying these interactions.\\n\\nBrown reveals that during Sheridan\\'s time at NIDA, they were attracted to both men and women. However, they were advised to keep their sexuality private to avoid jeopardizing their career.\\n\\nSheridan confirms this, sharing an incident where two teachers took them into an office and warned them not to tell anyone about their sexuality, claiming it would ruin their career prospects. Sheridan notes that both teachers were openly gay themselves. Brown points out that Sheridan\\'s sexuality was more fluid than people assumed.\\n\\nThe narrative shifts to Sheridan\\'s relationships. After their first male relationship ended, they started dating a woman again. Sheridan expresses that those who know them personally are aware of their relationships with both men and women. They acknowledge that this has caused confusion for some.\\n\\nSheridan then discusses their decision to write an essay about their experiences. They explain that they felt it was time to share their story, to pull back the curtain on the real Hugh.\\n\\nA magazine cover featuring Sheridan is shown, with the headline \"Packed To The Rafters\\' Hugh Sheridan addresses rumours about sexuality.\" The cover mentions Sheridan\\'s essay and interview, highlighting their honesty and vulnerability.\\n\\nSheridan states that the essay was a liberating experience, despite the difficulty they had in labeling themselves. They clarify that the main message of the essay was that it\\'s okay not to have all the answers.\\n\\nBrown asks Sheridan about the labels they used in the essay. Sheridan confirms using the label \"Hugh,\" but mentions being labeled \"non-binary\" by others and using the pronouns \"they/them,\" even though they personally identify with \"he/him.\" They explain that they didn\\'t correct the mislabeling at the time because they were scared.\\n\\nBrown then asks about Sheridan\\'s previous statement of being bisexual. Sheridan explains that they felt it was important to be honest in the article and express their attraction to both men and women. They acknowledge the evolving landscape of labels and express that they haven\\'t found one that perfectly fits them.\\n\\nThe conversation turns to Sheridan\\'s marriage. Brown asks if they were married, and Sheridan confirms they were, for nine years. They reveal that the story of their marriage broke when they got engaged to someone else, and it was published on the front page of a magazine. Sheridan reflects that they didn\\'t feel like they were lying or being secretive about their marriage, it just didn\\'t seem necessary to make it public.\\n\\nBrown asks if Sheridan believes it\\'s acceptable to sacrifice someone\\'s career for a bigger political point. Sheridan responds that certain actions are unacceptable, particularly those that harm or segregate others. They then shift the focus to the broader question of who should be allowed to tell certain stories in acting. They use examples of actors portraying characters like Adolf Hitler or terrorists, emphasizing that playing a role doesn\\'t equate to being that person in real life.\\n\\nSheridan expresses their desire to see more transgender people playing transgender characters, rather than having cisgender actors portray them.\\n\\nThe conversation concludes with Sheridan discussing their current role in \"Tick, Tick… Boom!\" They describe it as a joyful experience and express their appreciation for the story\\'s themes of determination and perseverance.\\n\\nThe video ends with Tara Brown providing information about the program\\'s social media presence and streaming options, followed by the show\\'s closing credits.\\n\\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\\n\\n* 60 Minutes (news program logo)\\n* NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art logo)\\n* Stellar Magazine (magazine cover)\\n* Amazon Prime Video (mentioned in Stellar Magazine article)\\n* Nine Now (streaming service logo)\\n* Lifeline (helpline logo)\\n\\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\\n\\n* Stage performances showcasing Sheridan\\'s talents\\n* Photoshoot setting where Sheridan appears distressed\\n* Staircase in a modern building (NIDA)\\n* Interview setting with Tara Brown\\n* Magazine cover featuring Sheridan\\n* Theatre stage with brick backdrop (Tick, Tick… Boom! performance)\\n\\n**KeyThemes**\\n\\n* Sexuality and fluidity\\n* Public vs. private life\\n* Pressure and scrutiny in the entertainment industry\\n* Importance of representation in acting\\n* Perseverance and determination\\n\\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\\n\\n* Hugh Sheridan (actor and singer)\\n* Tara Brown (journalist)\\n* Rafael De La Fuente (Sheridan\\'s ex-husband, mentioned)\\n* Jonathan Larson (playwright of \"Tick, Tick… Boom!\", mentioned in the magazine article)\\n* Adolf Hitler (mentioned as an example of a challenging character to portray)',\n",

       "  'headline': 'Murder, he wrote: Huge stars join Steve Martin’s whacky whodunnit',\n",
       "  'description': '<p>In an interview with <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> last year, actor, producer, author, comedian, musician, artist and cartoonist Steve Martin suggested that <em>Only Murders in the Building</em> might be his screen swansong. “When this television show is done, I’m not going to seek others. I’m not going to seek other movies. I don’t want to do cameos. This is, weirdly, it.”</p> <p>Given the 77-year-old’s prodigious talent and seemingly bottomless reservoir of delightfully off-beat yet spot-on ideas, that seems unlikely. Yet if the award-winning comedy-murder-mystery, a sparkling spin on the traditional whodunnit, is his last TV production, it would be a fitting finale.</p> <p>For starters, the jewel-coloured caper, set in a Manhattan apartment complex, again teams Martin with his long-time friend and collaborator, Martin Short. They first worked together in 1986 on <em>Three Amigos!</em> and since then have co-starred in a variety of productions, while also touring since 2015 with a succession of two-man stage shows.</p> <p>Martin quit the stand-up circuit in 1981, when he was one of the biggest drawcards in the business. Reflecting on his friend’s transition from stand-up star to box-office attraction, Short observed, “I think Steve learned the joy of collaboration. All through his stand-up life, he was by himself. Now, when he has success, he can celebrate with someone. And when something bombs, he can really laugh about it, as opposed to just being alone with it.”</p> <p><em>Only Murders</em> sprang from an idea of Martin’s that came up during a lunch conversation with producer Dan Fogelman (<em>This is Us</em>). Originally it involved three ageing male amateur sleuths who try to solve killings in their apartment block. Fogelman liked the idea and brought in writer-producer John Hoffman (<em>Grace and Frankie</em>) to develop it with Martin. The three male characters subsequently became two and were joined by a younger woman, with Selena Gomez becoming the third amigo.</p> <p>At the start of the series, these residents of the Arconia, a sprawling Beaux Arts building on the Upper West Side, are lonely strangers. Reclusive former TV star Charles-Hayden Savage (Martin), flamboyant failed Broadway producer Oliver Putnam (Short) and artist Mabel Mora (Gomez) are initially united by their passion for the true-crime podcasts hosted by Cinda Canning (Tina Fey).</p> <p>Then comes the discovery that they all shared an elevator with fellow resident Tim Kono (Julian Cihi) before he met his untimely death. And so a quirky band of self-appointed detectives is born and Oliver, sensing a business opportunity and desperately needing money to prevent eviction from his apartment, turns their adventures into a podcast.</p> <p>Playfully toying with the tropes of the genre, the series expands the classic locked-room whodunnit into an entire apartment building while presenting an array of quirky characters and nutty plot twists. Graced by snappy one-liners and zinging with pop-culture references, it surrounds the central trio with a winning assortment of family members, romantic interests and fellow residents, the latter including the wily, wonderfully grumpy Uma (Jackie Hoffman) and pernickety cat-lover Howard (Michael Cyril Creighton).</p> <p>It’s also boosted by a glittering parade of guest stars that includes Nathan Lane, Jane Lynch, Amy Ryan and Shirley MacLaine. One gets the impression of a troupe of eager friends and admirers of <em>Only Murders</em> waiting in the wings for an invitation to join the cast and cut loose with their own eccentric character.</p> <p>And when they pop up, like Lane’s spiky deli owner or Ryan’s murderous bassoonist, they seem to be having a fine time. That carries through to the new third season, in which Matthew Broderick drops in to play himself and delivers another in the series’ knowing and hilarious spoofs of actors.</p> <p>Through the first season, Charles, Oliver and Mabel grow into a de-facto family, coming to understand and rely on each other. “Our trio is the heart of everything and the reason for the success of this show,” showrunner John Hoffman has said. “The emotional stories for our three main characters, that is our true connective tissue.”</p> <p>One of the series’ strengths is the undercurrent of emotion that runs beneath the madcap antics, and it’s anchored in the idea that these loners, each with their own private pain and regrets, have found a loving and accepting place, and a sense of purpose, in a surrogate family. “We dig underneath everything to find love in the most unexpected places and redemption, truth and justice for victims and people who have had hard times,” Hoffman has explained. He’s also justifiably noted that “there are unknowns that catch you off-guard emotionally”.</p> <p>In season two, as this Scooby gang investigates the death of Arconia board president Bunny Folger (Jayne Houdyshell), the idea of family is expanded, developing Oliver’s relationship with his estranged son, detailing Charles’ separation from a girl he came to love like a daughter, a storyline that explains his obsessive omelette-making, and revealing Mabel’s anguish about her father’s death.</p> <p>The 10-part third season finds Mabel at crossroads: her aunt is selling the apartment that she’s been living in and renovating, and she worries that she’s yet to find her direction in life. Charles is happily involved with make-up artist Joy (Andrea Martin), until she moves in with him. And Oliver, capitalising on his new-found podcast fame, has been released from “Broadway jail” following years in exile after the disaster of a musical version of <em>Splash!</em> He’s at work on his next extravaganza with his customary enthusiasm and Howard as his assistant. It’s to be a murder mystery set in a lighthouse on a remote Nova Scotia island and the prime suspect is a baby. Yes, really.</p> <p>A casting call unearths the long-neglected talent of Loretta Durkin (Meryl Streep), whose audition for the nanny is a revelation. Charles has been cast as a cop and the leading man is Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd), the most recent resident of the Arconia penthouse previously occupied by Sting and then Amy Schumer. Ben is the self-absorbed star of a movie franchise, <em>CoBro</em>, in which, as he explains to Loretta without a hint of irony, he plays “the friendly zoologist who morphs into a 20-foot cobra and helps the cops save the day”.</p> <p>Much of the new season is set in the Goosebury Theatre, where the hijinks surrounding Oliver’s play unfold, and it’s infused by a love of the stage and particularly the bright lights of Broadway as it details the traditions and superstitions of theatre folk. These include “the white room” (sheer terror causing blackouts on stage), ghost lights (which must stay on at all times), patter songs (with rhyming lyrics delivered in rapid-fire tempo) and sitzprobe (the first cast rehearsal with an orchestra). This all feels entirely appropriate as the series’ cast has featured stage veterans such as Hoffman, Creighton and Houdyshell.</p> <p>Meanwhile there’s conflict in the de-facto family and the relationship between Oliver and Loretta develops in ways that allow for some wonderful scenes between Short and Streep. In a few scenes where Oliver reveals his ugly side, Short is extremely convincing and deeply unsettling given the series’ generally upbeat tone.</p> <p>It’s hard to imagine Martin quietly bowing out, putting down his pen or, in the case of Charles Haden-Savage, his omelette pan. “I just want to deliver entertainment,” he’s said. “I want them to go, ‘Oh, that was so good.’ That’s what I’m after.” Whatever happens beyond the third season of this beautifully crafted romp, mission accomplished.</p> <p><strong><em>Only Murders in the Building</em> (season three) is on Disney+.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'headline': 'Cate Blanchett sets the screen ablaze in the one-of-a-kind Tar',\n",
       "  'description': '<p><strong>Tar</strong> ★★★★½<br/>(M) 158 minutes</p> <p>Todd Field’s <em>Tar</em> breaks all the rules of conventional screenwriting. It begins with a long take dominated by dialogue in the service of one image – that of a supremely confident Lydia Tar (Cate Blanchett) painting a verbal self-portrait by describing her life as a celebrated conductor.</p> <p>She’s being interviewed on stage by <i>The New Yorker’s </i>Adam Gopnik and is giving him an unashamedly intellectual rundown on the mechanics of music-making and the philosophy behind it.</p> <p>The tone is so elevated and, at the same time, so elliptical that you start to feel as if you’re watching a biographical documentary. Or maybe a filmed play. It certainly doesn’t look or sound like the kind of American movie that gets a cinema release these days. There’s a distinctly European feel to the way Field asks his audience to search out any clues that elaborate on his theme<strong>. </strong>On the other hand, the film does come from Focus Features, the company behind some of the most intelligent American pictures of the past 20 years, including <em>Lost in Translation</em> and <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>.</p> <p>The suggestion that Field make a film about a conductor originally came from Focus, but Field did not expect them to accept the script he produced. It was to be his first film in 15 years and from interviews he’s given, it sounds as if he were a little afraid of it. But the green light went on and Blanchett’s performance has set it to blaze. She has immersed herself in every aspect of Tar’s character: her armouring of arrogance, her joy in the music, her damaging need to exert power and her vertiginous fall from grace. Blanchett, who has already won a Golden Globe for the role, deserves the awards.</p> <p>Tar’s personality can be read in her every move: the athleticism of her style on the concert platform, the impatience with which she charges through life off the podium and the desperation in her eyes as her carefully constructed existence begins to fray and fall apart.</p> <p>It happens as her career hits its peak. She is launching a memoir – modestly entitled <em>Tar on Tar</em> – and she’s rehearsing Mahler’s <em>Fifth Symphony</em> in Berlin where she lives with her partner Sharon (Nina Hoss), the orchestra’s concertmaster and first violinist, and their adopted Syrian daughter Petra (Mila Bogojevic). But we soon become acquainted with the quickness of her temper. It’s an early scene, a long unedited sequence in which Tar comes up against an equally confident young student who makes the mistake of telling her that he disdains Bach’s music because of the composer’s faults as a human being. There is little doubt as to who’s going to win that argument.</p> <p>At this point, her ego looks to be in such rude health that no one could put a dent in it. It also needs regular exercise, hence her habit of playing favourites with the young female musicians she encounters. There’s a pattern to these relationships. They go through three stages – seduction, subjection and rejection – and her assistant Francesca (Noemie Merlant), an aspiring conductor, has reached stage two, while a former assistant is mired in stage three. We don’t meet her, but her agonised emails about an inability to find work are proof of Tar’s ruthless efforts to stymie her career.</p> <p>It’s a film that already has a life beyond the screen. Tar’s fully furnished backstory and the brilliance of Blanchett’s portrayal have inspired some to play with the possibility that the conductor could actually exist. A parody Twitter account has been born. Thanks to the nightmarish nature of her downfall, other obsessives have decided that some of these sequences are the fruit of her own febrile imagination, springing from her worst fears. Field doesn’t mind. He has benignly declared that no interpretation of the film is wrong, so the game will probably go on for some time.</p> <p>One thing, however, is indisputable. The film is a genuine tragedy – a black comic tragedy, but a tragedy nonetheless. When great artists betray their talent by treating it carelessly and abusing the power that comes with it, it’s always a tragedy.</p> <p><strong><em>Tar</em> is in cinemas from January 26.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.

       "  'headline': 'The outrageous role that had Toni Collette ‘screaming with laughter’',\n",
       "  'description': '<p>When Toni Collette read British filmmaker Dean Craig’s script for <em>The Estate</em>, she began to giggle. The giggling lasted for months, throughout filming and as far as our interview to discuss the result: a 96-minute film about two impoverished sisters scheming to grab their dying aunt’s inheritance.</p> <p>It has shades of <em>Arsenic and Old Lace</em>, and even <em>Murder by Death</em>. It is not a whodunit, but rather an everyone-wants-to-do-it in which Kathleen Turner plays Aunt Hilda, a heinously nasty woman dying of cancer whose relationships are so toxic that as her family gather around her bedside they are all desperate to do away with her.</p> <p>“Reading the script for the first time looks like you giggling in a chair when everyone else is focused on something else, and [then] kind of screaming with laughter,” Collette says. “It’s a relief to read something funny, especially because we read it during lockdown. It was just like, oh, what a relief. It made me laugh so hard. It’s really, truly very funny.”</p> <p>For Anna Faris, who had come off a long run on the TV sitcom <em>Mom</em>, it was an opportunity to work with Collette. “Like all projects, there’s always a wobbly feeling right before you start shooting,” Faris says. “In the months prior, you are worried that something’s going to go wrong because that does happen, that the project is going to fall apart, but I felt desperate to work with her, to get to adore her on and off-screen.”</p> <p>On the set of the film, which was shot in New Orleans between February and March 2022, the two actresses immediately struck a rapport. “It was easy immediately; it wasn’t a long shoot, and we didn’t have time to warm up,” Collette says.</p> <p>“These sisters are very, very different, and they love each other more than life itself,” Collette adds. “And there’s a lot on the line, and I love that the comedy is within quite a serious context, that they have no money, and they don’t know how they’re going to survive.</p> <p>“So the hilarity comes from the absolute desperation, but I love that there is a serious nature [to the story]; otherwise you wouldn’t laugh as much,” Collette adds. “The extremes are there for a reason, and they are funnier because it is very ... well, it’s quite dire.”</p> <p><em>The Estate</em> sits on a knife’s edge between old-fashioned farce and absurdist comedy. Aunt Hilda (Turner) is ghastly, but her affections are feted by her niece Beatrice (Rosemarie DeWitt) and nephew Richard (David Duchovny). Less likely to win a slice of the inheritance are nieces Macey (Collette) and Savannah (Faris), who have sprung from the poorer branch of the family. Once all the contenders are in the house, however, an all-bets-are-off grab for the cash ensues.</p> <p>Faris says the narrative is held together by one factor: its sincerity. “I think that sincerity is the most important element, that you have to believe that your character has a goal and sincerely believes that they need to achieve it,” Faris says.</p> <p>Collette agrees. “They love each other, and how great is it that it’s a love story between sisters? They’d do anything for each other,” she says. “But those other two [Beatrice and Richard], they were outrageous. And it was so much fun to play [against] them and with them.”</p> <p>On a comedy set such as this, Collette says, there was not a lot of straight-face keeping. “We made each other laugh all the time,” she says. “You find yourself laughing at the material, but that’s what I, personally, wanted. I wanted to feel the joy, and I wanted to bring the joy. I think that’s all I want to do now. That’s all I want. I also remember thinking how fun it was seeing other people enjoy themselves.”</p> <p>Faris, who had worked on the <em>Scary Movie</em> franchise, had trained herself to suppress spontaneous laughter because the prop-driven scenes on those particular films were technically complex and laughter always risked ruining the shot. “I am disciplined when it comes to laughter,” Faris says. “But this movie felt different. It really felt professional because everyone is so excellent, and it felt liberating because everyone’s so excellent.”</p> <p>With a small cast – just six actors driving most of the scenes – and the self-contained space of Aunt Hilda’s mansion, which is the setting for most of the story, there were times when <em>The Estate</em> felt like a stage play adapted for the screen.</p> <p>“It was an incredible old mansion,” Collette says. “In and of itself, that was literally awesome, but we had rooms assigned to each of us, and we all ended up hanging out together in one room basically in between takes and setups. I can see what you’re saying, how it could feel like a play.”</p> <p>Adds Faris: “It did remind me of my theatre days just in terms of acting with so many brilliant people, and then that sort of playful yet professional attitude and the generosity of the other actors, especially Toni. It was amazing to shoot in that house. It was wild.”</p> <p>But most striking about <em>The Estate</em> is the authenticity of the world and its inhabitants. It does not happen on every film or television limited series, but when <em>The Estate</em> ends, there is a nagging thought at the back of the viewer’s mind: is this really the end? Will I not see these characters again? It does beg the question: might there be a sequel? Or a television series spin-off?</p> <p>“I love that. I would love to reunite,” says Faris. “For me, it was the perfect job at the perfect time. Truly, I was kind of thinking, I don’t know what I’m going to do with my career. I was coming off the long run of the show. And it felt really wonderful that it inspired me again and the quality of the actors that I got.”</p> <p>Collette concurs. “I would do anything to work with these actors again. It really was an amazing group of actors, for sure.”</p> <p><strong><em>The Estate</em> is on Amazon Prime.</strong></p> <p><b>Find out t<i>he next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'headline': 'Is Nathan Fielder for real? How a master of cringe comedy blends fact and fiction',\n",
       "  'description': '<p>One of Nathan Fielder’s strengths as a TV comic is that he doesn’t look like someone trying to be funny. Outwardly, he’s more the type you might expect to find manning an IT help desk or checking your taxes, with a blandly innocent face and a stiff manner that suggests he wouldn’t recognise a joke if he tripped over one.</p> <p>As his fans know, appearances couldn’t be more deceptive. But who is Fielder really, and what is he playing at? His new comedy-drama <em>The Curse</em>, co-starring Emma Stone, only deepens the mystery – but as a cheat sheet for newcomers, here are a few points we’re reasonably sure of.</p> <h3><strong>He’s an outsider</strong></h3> <p>Like many big names in American comedy, Fielder is Canadian. Born and raised in Vancouver, he went to the <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/seth-rogen-in-conversation.html\" target=\"_blank\">same high school</a> as Seth Rogen, where they were both part of an improv comedy group (Fielder was also a keen teenage magician). He went on to study at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, earning the business degree he touts in each episode of his breakout success <em>Nathan For You</em>, which premiered on Comedy Central in 2013.</p> <p>While <em>Nathan For You</em> gets ever more convoluted over the course of its four seasons, in essence, you might call it a prank show, as well as a spoof of reality TV. The awkwardly polite Fielder visits a range of struggling small businesses, mainly in Los Angeles, and offers dubious advice to the owners, who are desperate enough to give anything a try.</p> <p>How far do Fielder’s targets take him seriously, and how far are they just keen to appear on camera? It barely matters any more than it usually does in reality shows built around supposed expert advice. That may be part of the joke, along with the implication that no one expects showbiz types to resemble normal people: Fielder’s pedantic blankness suggests a visitor not from another country but another planet.</p> <h3>He’s a trickster</h3> <p>There’s no doubting TV Nathan and his real-world alter ego have much in common: both are lateral thinkers, both like to be in control, and neither is what you could call a regular guy. In other respects, however, they’re polar opposites: where TV Nathan genuinely wants to help people, the actual Fielder is more interested in messing with them for his and our amusement. The pattern is set in <em>Nathan For You</em>’s first episode, in which our hero successfully convinces the proprietor of a frozen yoghurt shop to market a product that literally tastes like poo (“I feel like a poo yoghurt flavour would be a news story”).</p> <p>While that goes about as well as you’d expect, other Nathan schemes have found more success – like his line of outdoor apparel that promotes awareness of the Holocaust, or his pop-up Dumb Starbucks store, a replica of an actual Starbucks that used parody law to circumvent copyright by adding the word “Dumb” to every menu item (“Dumb Iced Coffee,” “Dumb Frappuccino” and so forth). Still, the bottom line is that few of his business associates appear to gain much from joining forces with him, beyond some not wholly desirable publicity – and the chance to take a break from what we usually think of as the real world.</p> <h3>He makes people uncomfortable</h3> <p><em>Nathan For You</em> is a masterpiece of cringe comedy: the laughter it draws from us is the painful sort, obtained by maximising discomfort on every level. Aside from Nathan’s terrible business ideas, there are his no less excruciating attempts at bonding with those around him, not to mention the ethical unease generated by the show as a whole. Don’t these people deserve better than being exploited for laughs? Is the joke on us for finding any of this funny.</p> <p>Such questions loom even larger in Fielder’s follow-up series <em>The Rehearsal</em>, which premiered on HBO in 2022 (a second season is in the pipeline). This too is billed as a reality show of sorts, in which Nathan offers participants the chance to prepare for a life challenge – say, a confrontation with a friend or family member – by playing out a simulated version ahead of time.</p> <p>In summary, the concept might not sound entirely absurd. But soon its logic starts to get out of hand, revealing TV Nathan as a megalomaniac bent on manipulating and reconstructing everything in sight. Behind the scenes, the actual Fielder appears to be up to a version of the same thing – that is, supposing anything we see is “real” in any sense at all.</p> <h3>He’s an artist</h3> <p>Which brings us to <em>The Curse</em>, Fielder’s first fully-scripted comedy-drama, which he co-created with the indie director and character actor Benny Safdie (<em>Uncut Gems</em>). It’s not a big surprise that the plot takes us behind the scenes of an imaginary reality show: Fielder and Stone play Asher and Whitney Siegel, the newly married stars of <em>Flipanthropy</em>, which shows them doing their best for “eco-conscious housing” in the actual town of Espanola, New Mexico (Safdie, an actual executive producer of <em>The Curse</em>, plays the producer of the show within the show).</p> <p>The first episode depends on some relatively familiar ironies, with Asher and Whitney’s supposed good intentions undercut by their determination to control how they appear on camera. But Fielder’s track record gives us much more to ponder. Given he’s previously claimed to know nothing about acting, is he a credible match for an Oscar-winning movie star like Stone? Are any of these characters meant to be credible, whatever that means? Is it possible that <em>The Curse</em> in its entirety is not what it appears, but part of a prank to be revealed further down the line?</p> <p>What we mainly know for now is that Fielder is playing with us, slipping from reality to fiction and back again, holding the mirror up to nature while bringing home that the nature of a mirror is to get everything back to front. We also know the game may involve a degree of risk – but that this is unlikely to reduce the fun of playing along.</p> <p><strong><em>The Curse</em> is streaming now on Paramount Plus, with new episodes each Saturday.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b style=\"font-size: 1.125rem\"><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'headline': 'Steven Spielberg’s newest film is his most personal yet. But is it good?',\n",
       "  'description': '<p><strong>The Fabelmans ★★★★</strong><br/><strong>(M) 151 minutes</strong></p> <p>“In this family,” declares Mitzi Fabelman, “it’s the scientists versus the artists. Sammy’s on my team. He takes after me.”</p> <p>It’s said lightly but there’s no doubt that Mitzi (Michelle Williams) means it. She’s laying down a dividing line that will turn out to be one of the governing principles of her son, Sammy’s upbringing.</p> <p>Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) is a fictionalised version of Steven Spielberg, who waited until his parents’ deaths before embarking on this account of his childhood and adolescence because he didn’t want to risk hurting them. It’s the kind of dilemma faced by most artists and writers who work close to home and many of them approach it a lot more ruthlessly than Spielberg does here. While he takes an unflinching look at his parents’ marriage and the reasons for their eventual split, his focus is softened by his love for them both – Burt, Sammy’s highly intelligent father whose imagination is concentrated on facts, figures and mathematical abstractions, and Mitzi, his starry-eyed mother, a frustrated visionary who can’t shake off her regret at having forfeited a promising career as a classical pianist to become a housewife and mother.</p> <p>Luminously portrayed by Williams, she’s a woman full of shifting moods and colours – warm-hearted yet mercurial with an irresistible urge to avoid boredom at all cost. Her husband can often be spotted gazing at her with a mixture of admiration and bewilderment. Played by Paul Dano, an actor whose pale, open face works like a mirror of his inner self, effortlessly reflecting every rippling thought and feeling, he regards her as a puzzle he will never solve. Yet he loves her with an intensity he has no hope of expressing because they don’t share an emotional language.</p> <p>When young Sammy is given an 8mm movie camera and makes the all-important discovery that film is to become his lifelong occupation, Burt doesn’t get it. He dismisses this new passion as a “hobby”. Mitzi, however, understands instantly. “Movies,” she says, “are dreams that you never forget.”</p> <p>In the 1970s and early ’80s, most of Spielberg’s films dealt nostalgically with the pleasures of childhood, which meant that he and George Lucas became responsible for the revitalisation of the “family film”, a genre which had been effectively colonised by Disney and its commitment to the safe and the wholesome. Spielberg and Lucas pumped energy and suspense into it, bringing out the impressionable child in moviegoers of all ages while harking back to the classics of their own moviegoing in the 1950s.</p> <p><em>The Fabelmans</em> opens with a memorable example – Cecil B. DeMille’s circus picture, <em>The Greatest Show on Earth</em>, which climaxes with a train accident. Sammy is thoroughly shaken up by this spectacle and when Burt and Mitzi buy him a model train, he promptly crashes it, to Burt’s dismay. But once again, Mitzi understands. She suggests that he choreograph another pile-up and her son goes on to exorcise his fear by using his camera to film it.</p> <p>The camera becomes Sammy’s extra limb – or, more aptly, his third eye. By putting things on film, he can better comprehend them but these truths also come at a price. It’s the camera which leads him to the realisation that Mitzi is in love with Bennie (Seth Rogen), his father’s best friend, for Bennie can do something Burt can’t – make her laugh.</p> <p>While the film is the most personal that Spielberg has ever made, full of wistful insights into the tragedy spawned by Burt and Mitzi’s mismatched temperaments, it also shows how deeply he’s steeped himself in the Hollywood movie’s genres and syntax. Running in tandem with the story of Sammy’s life at home is a typical high school movie about his misadventures as a Jewish kid being bullied by the jocks among his Californian classmates. But here, too, the camera proves to be his most powerful weapon, securing his popularity because he knows how to turn his fellow students into movie stars – and villains.</p> <p>Spielberg has packed all these things into a deceptively simple narrative which flows so smoothly that it’s easy to miss its finer points. In that sense, it crystallises his innate ability to translate the most delicate subtleties into entertainment.</p> <p><strong><em>The Fabelmans</em> is in cinemas January 5.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>A cultural guide to going out and loving your city.

       "  'description': '<p>The flashbulbs, designer gowns, celebrities, screaming fans and red-carpet mayhem at the Cannes Film Festival is a universe away from outback life in Alice Springs, the home of Australia’s newest shining film star – 11-year-old <strong>Aswan Reid</strong>.</p> <p>The youngster, who has never acted before, plays the lead role opposite <strong>Cate Blanchett</strong> in acclaimed Australian director <strong>Warwick Thornton’s</strong> latest film <em>The New Boy</em>, about Indigenous children in an outback orphanage during the 1940s being converted to Christianity, which had a standing ovation at its world premiere at Cannes.</p> <p>While Hollywood bible <em>Variety</em> magazine acknowledged Oscar-winning Blanchett – who plays a renegade nun – would lure international distributors and audiences, it singled out “kinetic, wide-eyed novice Aswan Reid” as <em>The New Boy’s</em> “secret weapon”.</p> <p>But it’s a “weapon” that is being fiercely protected by a group of powerful industry “mother hens”, chief among them Blanchett, co-star <strong>Deborah Mailman</strong> and the film’s producer <strong>Kath Shelper</strong>.</p> <p>“He took Cannes in his stride, he is an incredibly down-to-earth boy. I think he handled it better than we did,” Shelper told PS after touching down from France on Thursday. She also worked with Thornton 14 years ago on his debut feature <em>Samson &amp; Delilah</em>, which also cast young unknown actors from remote Indigenous communities.</p> <p>“Casting agents don’t tend to have these kids on their books. We knew we would have to go to remote communities to find them … Aswan’s mum sent in a video after she saw our flyer. He was the first boy we saw, and we knew he was perfect.</p> <p>“Yes, acting is a tough game, but there is a strong support structure around him, including his family. Aswan knows he has to finish school and get an education. The whole experience of making this film has been a positive one, and I think that has really inspired all the boys.</p> <p>“They knew they were helping to tell an important cultural story, they were inspired by an Indigenous man at the helm … They saw what they can achieve. The only thing Aswan wanted to do when he got back to Australia was go to school and tell his mates about what he had been doing in Cannes.”</p> <p>Before he flew to Cannes, Thornton told film writer Garry Maddox what a special performer Reid was.</p> <p>“The universe just blessed me with a child who I think is going to be one of the biggest actors in the world pretty soon,” he said.</p> <p>“He’s incredibly knowledgeable, even at that young age, about life and survival.”</p> <p>Reid is one of eight Indigenous children in the film, all of whom will be at the Sydney Film Festival for its Australian premiere on June 7, ahead of a cinematic release on July 6.</p> <p>“None of them had ever bloody acted before,” Thornton said.</p> <p>“Completely drove me mad, in a beautiful way. In the morning I’d watch them all rock up in a 12-seater coach.</p> <p>“The blood would drain out of my head. Then we’d do one take of the first scene and all the blood would go back to my head because they were all incredibly amazing.”</p> <p>Reid, now thrust into the global spotlight, follows a path of celebrity that has not been easy for others from similar backgrounds.</p> <p>The late <strong>David Gulpilil</strong>, arguably Australia’s most revered and loved Indigenous actor, was discovered living traditionally in Arnhem Land as a 16-year-old before his first role in 1971’s <em>Walkabout</em>. Despite countless performances, fame was not easy for him and he had a lifetime battling addiction, spent time in jail, and died at just 68.</p> <p>More recently, <strong>Baz Luhrmann</strong> “discovered” nine-year-old <strong>Brandon Walters</strong> in Broome, propelling him into the glare of international showbiz after casting him alongside <strong>Nicole Kidman</strong> and <strong>Hugh Jackman</strong> in big-budget 2008 film <em>Australia</em>.</p> <p>The film made more than $300 million, but Walters’ life today is far removed from those of his former co-stars. Now a father of two, he has spoken openly about his difficult home life, getting in trouble with the law, drugs and returning to his former life after tasting fame.</p> <h3><strong>JEWEL SALE SPARKS INTRIGUE </strong></h3> <p>Last year it was the sale of presumed-dead fraudster <strong>Melissa Caddick’s</strong> jewels that intrigued Sydney – some of which PS revealed were snapped up, at discount, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/celebrity/packer-heiress-does-some-serious-bargain-shopping-at-caddick-auction-20221206-p5c47m.html\" target=\"_blank\">by heiress <strong>Francesca Packer</strong></a>, seemingly unfazed by their dubious provenance.</p> <p>Packer has been in Europe on an extended holiday with her controversial beau <strong>Robert Bates</strong>, so we are yet to see her wear them in Sydney, a city where the enormous bespoke pieces designed by celebrity jeweller <strong>Stefano Canturi</strong> are now well-known thanks to Caddick.</p> <p>Now, it is the coming sale of another extraordinary jewellery collection, described as being at cost price even though some pieces are still expected to fetch tens of thousands of dollars, that is attracting attention.</p> <p>The rare pieces on offer, which range from an antique diamond necklace once worn by Nicole Kidman to a Victorian “fertility” charm are being sold by <strong>Annemie Stein</strong>.</p> <p>Stein is the mother of <strong>Justin Stein</strong>, who was charged in January 2022 with the horrific murder of nine-year-old schoolgirl <strong>Charlise Mutten</strong>.</p> <p>He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and denies allegations that he shot the little girl while she was on holiday with her mother <strong>Kallista Mutten</strong> at the Stein family’s luxury wedding property Wildenstein, a lavish estate in the Blue Mountains where AFL star <strong>Lance ‘Buddy’ Franklin</strong> and former Miss Universe Australia <strong>Jesinta Campbell</strong> married in 2016.</p> <p>Justin Stein, 32, who attended Sydney’s elite Cranbrook School and remains in custody, is also accused of placing Charlise’s remains in a barrel and dumping it in bushland on the banks of the Colo River 65 kilometres away.</p> <p>Stein will be arraigned in the Supreme Court in July, just weeks after his mother auctions the jewels at Woollahra’s Leonard Joel.</p> <p>Last year, Annemie Stein shut the doors on her exclusive antique jewellery shop Martin &amp; Stein, which she ran for many years with her now former husband James Stein. The store had been a fixture for well-heeled Sydneysiders and wealthy visitors in the Queen Victoria Building.</p> <h3><strong>WHAT’S NEXT AFTER 67 DAYS ALONE?</strong></h3> <p>Winner of SBS’s hit survival series <em>Alone Australia</em> <strong>Gina Chick</strong> had to keep her victory a secret for almost a year after she was ferried out of the remote Tasmanian wilderness, having lasted 67 days eating fish guts, worms and wallaby bits.</p> <p>She has also had to wait that long to get her hands on the $250,000 prize money, though she has been too busy to think about spending it, given her publicity blitz this week.</p> <p>PS suspects this is not the last we will be seeing of Chick, a natural television talent who delivered a brutal, eloquent, at times deeply moving and disarmingly authentic experience on the series, the most popular SBS has ever made.</p> <p>She has retained a literary agent and written a book, has composed her own music she wants to release, and is understood to be very open to future television appearances. Perhaps her old mate <strong>Hugh Jackman</strong> could assist? The pair became firm friends after studying together at UTS decades ago.</p> <p>Chick is the daughter of acclaimed author <strong>Suzanne Chick</strong> and the granddaughter of Australian writer <strong>Charmian Clift</strong>.</p> <h3><strong>HOW TINA TURNER BOOSTED ONJ’S CAREER</strong></h3> <p>The world can also thank the late <strong>Tina Turner</strong> for a large part of <strong>Olivia Newton-John’s</strong> career. Following last week’s item about Turner’s Australian uber-manager <strong>Roger Davies</strong> being portrayed on stage in the new <em>Tina: The Tina Turner Musical</em>, PS was alerted to one of the few, if not the only interview the reclusive Davies appears to have ever done.</p> <p>Former roadie and music journalist <strong>Julius Grafton</strong> got the rare pleasure in 1992, which he later published in his memoir <em>This Could Be Serious</em>. At the time, Davies also had <strong>Sade</strong> and <strong>Janet Jackson</strong> on his books, but recalled how he eventually took over managing both Tina and ONJ from his former business associate <strong>Lee Cramer</strong>, who had been dating Australia’s sweetheart until they had a messy break-up.</p> <p>“I became the meat in the sandwich – he’d tell me to tell her things, as the messenger boy. I hardly knew her, and a month later I’m sitting on a plane next to her, going to Europe to record <em>Xanadu</em> with Jeff Lynne in Germany,” Davies revealed, explaining he would soon assume sole responsibility for both women’s careers.</p> <p>“At that stage, <strong>Steve Kipner</strong> had written a song called <em>Physical</em> which I wanted Tina to record, but she didn’t like it. I said to Olivia, ‘You should record this’, and she said, ‘Really?’”</p> <p>Of course, the rest is history. We also have Davies to thank for Turner recording <em>What’s Love Got to Do with It</em>, another song she initially did not like but was convinced by Davies to record, though it was originally intended for the sappy British pop band Bucks Fizz. Can you imagine?</p> <h3><strong>DINING WITH SOCIETY GHOSTS IN HISTORIC MANSION</strong></h3> <p>If only the walls could talk. Bollinger’s debonair international man of bubbles <strong>Guy de Rivoire</strong> flew in from France to host an elegant candlelit dinner party to celebrate its vintage champagne inside one of Sydney’s most socially historic mansions on Thursday.</p> <p>As the grand piano tinkled away in the ballroom, PS was one of the lucky few to sit in the dining room, which has hosted everyone from <strong>Clyde</strong> and <strong>Kerry Packer</strong> to<strong> Bob Hope</strong> and a young <strong>Prince Philip</strong>, a regular visitor there during his time in Sydney during World War II, when he often brought his uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten with him. The late Duke of Edinburgh returned to the home many times over subsequent trips to Australia.</p> <p>As we sipped the 1985 – older than several guests at the dinner – PS pondered the three generations of Sydney’s Hordern retailing dynasty that have lived in the Ginahgulla Road property, an elegant Mediterranean-style pile that looks like it should be on Sunset Boulevard with Norma Desmond descending the grand staircase</p> <p>Designed by the feted architect <strong>Leslie Wilkinson</strong>, it was built in 1935 as a wedding gift to <strong>Samuel Hordern III</strong> and<strong> June Baillieu</strong> – who became close friends of the late Duke of Edinburgh – to mark the union of two of Australia’s most influential families.</p> <p>In 2018 it was revealed the refreshingly intact mansion would stay in the family after it was bought for more than $21million by their Melbourne-born relatives, the Baillieus.</p> <p><b><i>The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p57ogt\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Sign up here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

For Andrew Barth Feldman, Lawrence’s co-star in the raunchy new comedy <em>No Hard Feelings</em>, it’s an interesting development.</p> <p>“Look, Harvard’s always going to be there and I’m not in any rush to finish it,” the 21-year-old says over Zoom from New York City, through a boyish smile that makes him look even younger. “Right now, this wave has proven to be so beautiful for me that it would be the hugest mistake not to ride it.”</p> <p>For an actor whose work to date has been contained to the worlds of musical theatre and TV – he took over the titular role in <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> on Broadway when he was just 16, and was later a recurring fixture on <em>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</em> alongside pop star Olivia Rodrigo – the film should prove an explosive box office baptism.</p> <p>A high-concept comedy the likes of which Hollywood’s shied away from for years, <em>No Hard Feelings</em> stars Lawrence as Maddie, a 32-year-old stunted Millennial who’s fallen behind on tax payments on the home left to her by her late mother. Living in the summering hotspot of Montauk, on New York’s Long Island, she relies on the income she makes as an Uber driver as her annual nest egg – but when her car gets impounded, she has to make other plans. She responds to a Craigslist ad from the parents of a shy, introverted 19-year-old named Percy (Feldman), who are offering their Buick Regal in exchange for a woman to “bring him out of his shell” before he heads off to college, if you catch their drift.</p> <p>The film’s plot was based on a supposedly real Craigslist ad its producers found online. If it seems an outrageous hook for a modern comedy starring America’s sweetheart, it’s already worked.</p> <p>When the film’s red band trailer was launched in March it became a surprise viral hit, commenters extolling its edgy tone and Lawrence’s long-awaited turn from serious actress to onscreen goof. Directed by Gene Stupnitsky (<em>Bad Teacher</em>), it seemed to strike a chord with a post-#MeToo culture that’s suddenly in the mood for a throwback to the raunchy sex-romps of the late-’90s and early-’00s era of <em>American Pie</em> and <em>Van Wilder</em>. As one of the top YouTube comments on the trailer awkwardly noted (do we all talk like Hollywood marketing executives now?), “The R-rated mid-budget studio comedy is back!”</p> <p>Well, little did we know. Although tender at heart – the film’s essentially a plea to let kids grow at their own pace, screw-ups and all – it’s also outrageous in parts. One scene in particular (to get back to the skinny-dipping) is sure to spawn shocked word-of-mouth once the film’s released. If you already thought Jennifer Lawrence was fearless on screen, wait till you see what she does in service of an extended laugh.</p> <p>“Jen is down for things that other people would not be, things that are intimidating for me to even think about,” says Feldman. “But I think this movie is so funny and never gratuitous. Everything that seems shocking is totally there for a reason, it’s crucial to these characters’ journeys.</p> <p>“Definitely, it may have sat a little uncomfortable at first, just as it would in anybody’s body,” he adds of the scene. “But everybody on set, including Jen, was so considerate of our comfort. It was a closed set, we had intimacy coordinators and all that, so nothing ever felt unsafe or uncomfortable to a point of being unacceptable. It was only as uncomfortable as it needed to be for our characters to be truthful.”</p> <p>In the film, Percy’s timidity is framed as a natural hangup of the Gen-Z experience, where lives – even fulfilling ones – are largely lived online and behind screens. Feldman says he immediately understood Percy, but getting into musical theatre at eight freed him from a restrictive bubble. “That’s where the misfits go to not be so misfit, so I was lucky that I always felt very sociable.”</p> <p>He scored the role after sending in a self-tape that impressed the producers so much he got called in to do a chemistry read with Lawrence where the pair instantly bonded. “We immediately just clicked,” Feldman recalls. “Since filming, we’ve hung out a bit – we did an escape room together that was really fun, we went to the park with her son and stuff like that. We really are, like, real-life great friends, and I don’t know how to say that without it sounding like a lie.”</p> <p>Although the screenplay was written by two men – Stupnitsky and John Phillips – Lawrence’s influence shows (she’s also a producer on the film through her production company, Excellent Cadavers). Flipping the script on those bro-heavy Y2K raunchfests, the film draws big laughs from Maddie’s overzealous attempts to seduce poor Percy, including a scene where Feldman reluctantly cops a lap dance from Lawrence.</p> <p>“I mean, there was a whole choreography to that,” Feldman laughs of the scene. “It was a full day of filming. Jen would be doing all this stuff and Gene would just throw me awkward things to say, like, ‘Oh, did you grow up dancing?’ None of those things were in the script. But it was just a really great day to celebrate Jen and all the things that she was so game for in this movie.”</p> <p><em>No Hard Feelings</em> comes at an intriguing time for Lawrence. After a string of poorly received dramas that have seen her A-list credentials questioned, it’s the Oscar-winner changing tack, all pratfalls and mean-mugging, her first proper stab at leveraging her playful off-screen persona towards box office gold. In press notes, her fellow producer Alex Saks spoke of Stupnitsky’s idea of bringing “a version of Jen that only her close friends had seen” to the big screen. Whether the film succeeds or fails, it feels like a big swing for Lawrence – not least for the provocative chances she takes throughout.</p> <p>Feldman, on the other hand, is enjoying the ride and looking ahead to what its increased exposure might bring. “Right now, I’m saying yes or no to things based on just how they strike me emotionally as opposed to what they’ll, quote-unquote, do for me,” he says of his next plans. “My goal is not one of fame or wanting to have the biggest career possible but just telling stories I care about, like this one.”</p> <p><strong><em>No Hard Feelings</em> is in cinemas now.</strong></p> <p><b>To read more from</b><b><i> Spectrum</i></b><b>, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/spectrum-smh-hog\" target=\"_blank\">visit our page here</a>.</b></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56jp0\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'headline': 'This drama about the opioid epidemic is a triumph that never obscures the tragedy',\n",
       "  'description': '<p><strong>Painkiller ★★★★½</strong><br/>Netflix</p> <p>Each episode in this compelling limited series about the opioid epidemic that took hundreds of thousands of American lives over the past 25 years begins with the standard disclaimer that while it’s based on true events some elements have been fictionalised. But each time it’s delivered verbally by a different parent who adds that what’s unequivocally true is that they lost a child to OxyContin, a legal prescription painkiller as strong as heroin. It’s a jarring gambit – wrenching and unexpected. That’s what <em>Painkiller</em> excels at.</p> <p>Conceived by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, who worked from notable non-fiction books and articles, the drama doesn’t just try to encapsulate a public health disaster. It accentuates some strands, whether with the farcical or the furious, and treats others bone dry. Throughout the show, the force behind OxyContin, Purdue Pharma CEO Dr Richard Sackler (Matthew Broderick), calmly converses with his late uncle and predecessor, Arthur Sackler (Clark Gregg). It sounds distracting, but as with OxyContin cutting a swathe through communities, the unthinkable swiftly becomes normalised.</p> <p>The satire here is bilious: “You’re not killing enough pain, Daddy,” Purdue sale rep Britt Hufford (Dina Shihabi) tells a doctor cautiously prescribing OxyContin, and Britt’s commission-rich enthusiasm soon rubs off on her protege, Shannon Schaeffer (West Duchovny). The characters are vividly sketched, but the show takes you carefully through the exculpatory detail, such as the words Purdue got the US Food and Drug Administration to approve on the packaging that allowed for addiction-level dosages; the assessor responsible was subsequently hired by Purdue.</p> <p>Director Peter Berg, turning the clock back on his own career to standout movies such as <em>Friday Night Lights</em> and <em>The Kingdom</em>, twists the dial on the tone and tempo of different strands. Garish editing stokes the mood at Purdue, where selling OxyContin is “a crusade”, while the story of a rural family where the mechanic father, Glen Kryger (Taylor Kitsch), becomes addicted to OxyContin after a serious workplace accident is told with an unwavering gaze that makes the collateral damage of an addict’s descent witheringly clear.</p> <p>The dedicated guide through this narrative, in a bittersweet performance, is a West Virginia state attorney, Edie Flowers (Uzo Aduba), who speaks from a place of defeat after an early attempt to rein in Purdue was sabotaged. <em>Painkiller</em> is notably good at conveying information in unusual, telling ways, and offers deeply illustrative moments – “18 is the record,” a coroner says, showing Edie undigested OxyContin tablets in an overdose victim’s stomach. This is densely packed and damning viewing. A triumph that never obscures the tragedy.</p> <p><strong>Telemarketers</strong> <strong>★★★</strong><br/>Binge, Monday</p> <p>This HBO documentary about telemarketing scams in America was 25 years in the making, but it never quite decides which of its promising elements to focus on. Is it an indictment of insidious corruption, a portrait of the marginalised, or a character study of an eccentric friend? Adam Bhala Lough and Sam Lipman-Stern’s three-part series never commits, so it settles for being less than the sum of its parts.</p> <p>Lipman-Stern was a trouble-chasing teen in the 1990s when he first got a gig in a New Jersey call centre, cold-calling on behalf of organisations who sold their charitable rights to a shady sweatshop. The aspiring filmmaker took his camcorder to work, where the atmosphere was <em>Animal House</em> meets <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>, and bonded with his co-worker, Pat Pespas.</p> <p>The pair pledged to take down the industry from within, but despite invoking Michael Moore, these budding investigators only make incremental progress; gaps are filled in by headlines as they realise powerful police unions are involved. The depiction of Pespas veers between dedicated and delusional, but doesn’t capture him. <em>Telemarketers</em> is amusing and occasionally intriguing, but I wouldn’t be surprised if one of its eminent executive producers – Benny and Josh Safdie or Danny McBride – subsequently makes a better fictionalised version.</p> <p><strong>Strange Planet</strong><br/>Apple TV+</p> <p>Best sampled as a palate cleanser, this wry animated anthology adapted by Nathan W. Pyle and <em>Community</em> creator Dan Harmon from the former’s cult webcomic, is a look through a different lens at our own world. Set on an alien planet where the curvy blue creatures are essentially us with a lack of obfuscation and dishonesty – coffee is “jitter liquid” and everyone calmly states their grievances – the show highlights the strange rituals and illogical triumph of emotion that distorts our lives. Clever, droll, and best in small doses.</p> <p><strong>Only Murders in the Building</strong> (season 3)<br/>Disney+</p> <p>Just a reassuring check-in to note that the first episode from the new season of this whimsical comedy mystery doesn’t skip a beat: Steve Martin, Selena Gomez, and Martin Short’s incorrigible sleuths get a new case, with a Broadway production as the backdrop and cheerful slights as prompt as ever. It’s noticeable how well a pair of illustrious additions to this season – Meryl Streep and Paul Rudd – fit into the screwball patter while getting multiple chances to shine in their own way. Big ticks all around.</p> <p><strong>Good Omens</strong> (season 2)<br/>Amazon Prime</p> <p>Four years after the first season of this so very English fantasy comedy about an angel (Michael Sheen’s Aziraphale) and a demon (David Tennant’s Crowley) trying to keep the comfortable status quo intact on Earth, co-author Neil Gaiman returns to the realm he created with the late Terry Pratchett in their 1990 novel of the same name. Tasked with hiding an amnesiac Archangel Gabriel (Jon Hamm), the unlikely divine comrades remain a terrific double act. There are multiple diversions and flashbacks in this season, but together they carry the day.</p> <p><strong>Tar</strong><br/>Binge &amp; Netflix</p> <p>No offence to <em>Barbie</em> and <em>Oppenheimer</em>, but the finest film I’ve seen in a cinema this year remains Todd Field’s existential thriller about the unravelling of a monstrous genius – Cate Blanchett’s Lydia Tar, the celebrated conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Now streaming, the movie has lost none of its unsettling suggestion or power-laden dynamic, all of which is sculpted with impeccable visual technique by Field as the privilege that the maestro has wielded with cavalier disregard begins to haunt her life and work. A second viewing reveals so much more.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'description': '<p>The Sundance Film Festival met the moment by going virtual for the past two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But on Thursday, there was a palpable sense of relief from the festival’s leadership team at being in-person again.</p> <p>Sundance Institute boss Joana Vicente, director of programming Kim Yutani, senior programmer John Nein and incoming Sundance Film Festival director Eugene Hernandez gathered on Thursday afternoon in Park City, Utah, to discuss what’s to come. Just outside, on a snowy Main Street, finishing touches were being put on storefronts and restaurants that sponsors have taken over for the week.</p> <p>“It feels so good to be back in person,” Vicente said. “There’s nothing like the magic of being together in Park City.”</p> <p>Yutani also announced the last-minute addition of <em>Justice</em>, a documentary from filmmaker Doug Liman about allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that will debut on Friday.</p> <p>“It was a powerful documentary that we felt was important to add,” Yutani said. “We saw it, like, yesterday.”</p> <p>Eleven films had their world premieres on Thursday night, including the documentary <em>Little Richard: I Am Everything</em> and the Frankenstein-inspired psychological horror <em>Birth/Rebirth </em>about a morgue technician who reanimates a little girl. Also on Thursday was, <em>Shayda</em>, about an Iranian mother and her six-year-old daughter who go to a women’s shelter in Australia; <em>The Longest Goodbye</em>, a documentary about a NASA psychologist preparing Mars-bound astronauts for social isolation; the Daisy Ridley film <em>Sometimes I Think About Dying;</em> and <em>Kim’s Video</em>, a documentary about a hunt for a lost video collection of 55,000 movies.</p> <p>Programmers watched 16,000 films to determine this year’s slate of 111 films and say that there is something for everyone. Biographical documentaries, films about world issues and diasporic filmmaking are especially popular this year.</p> <p>Nein said that he expects audiences to be buzzing about the performances of both known stars like Jonathan Majors in <em>Magazine Dreams</em>, Cynthia Erivo in <em>Drift</em>, and Eugenio Derbez in <em>Radical</em> and newcomers like Lío Mehiel in <em>Mutt</em> and Priya Kansara in <em>Polite Society</em>.</p> <p>The Sundance Institute hosted a dinner on Thursday night honouring filmmaker Luca Guadagnino, Ryan Coogler, Nikyatu Jusu and W. Kamau Bell. There was a fundraising component to support the institute’s work; Vicente said that it has been a financially challenging few years for the institute.</p> <p>Sundance is not just a festival, after all. The non-profit institute, founded by Robert Redford in 1981, provides year-round support to emerging filmmakers with labs, fellowships and mentorship.</p> <p>“The festival is this amazing platform to celebrate and share with audiences,” Vicente said. “But really, as Robert Redford says, the engine, the most important work we do happens year-round.”</p> <p>Filmmaker Sophie Barthes, whose film <em>The Pod Generation</em> is among the opening night selections, attributes her career to the Sundance Institute. Her first short film debuted at the festival almost 20 years ago, marking the beginning of a relationship that continues to this day. Over the years, she participated in the director’s lab, the composers’ lab and the writers’ lab. It’s also where she debuted her first feature, <em>Cold Souls</em>, with Paul Giamatti, in 2009.</p> <p>“I wouldn’t be here without Sundance,” Barthes said in a recent interview. “They helped my career so much. I had like 50 advisers, the best of the best in the industry. It was like a film school on steroids. For filmmakers it’s the best thing that can happen to you because once you enter the family, they help and support you.”</p> <p><em>The Pod Generation</em> is a futuristic satire about a New York couple (played by Emilia Clarke and Chiwetel Ejiofor) who use an “artificial womb” to get pregnant. She wanted to explore not-so-far-off advancements like artificial gestation and AI therapy and poke at ideas like detachment parenting.</p> <p>“It’s a satire about the fact that we’ve lost so many of our instincts because of this modern life, we’re trying to reinvent the wheel and it becomes very comical,” Barthes said. “I think it’s very funny to explore the psychology of parents, especially in New York.”</p> <p>She hopes the film raises a debate about our relationship to technology. It will also be part of the “beyond film” conversations taking place in Park City outside of the cinemas throughout the week. Subjects range from how to crossover from television to film, with <em>Flight Attendant</em> director Susanna Fogel whose <em>Cat Person</em> is premiering at the festival, to representation, with Randall Park and Marlee Matlin. There will be conversations about making your first feature and even burnout, with Majors, food writer Ruth Reichl and graphic novelist Adrian Tomine. Many of the sponsors, from Acura to Adobe, are also hosting timely conversations as well about climate change in movies, reclaiming trans narratives, building inclusive productions and even getting into Sundance.</p> <p>The festival has continued to evolve over the past few years. Though in-person was the priority, they also committed to a hybrid format. This year some 80 films will be available to watch online for ticketholders. The digital package, Vicente said, sold out very quickly. “The last two years have been successful, but there’s nothing that can replace the in-person experience of watching films on the big screen,” Yutani said.</p> <p>The Sundance Film Festival runs through January 29.</p> <p><strong>AP</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.</i></b><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "  'headline': 'Why chilly Scotland is the hottest place on TV right now',\n",
       "  'description': '<p>Scotland is so hot right now. Well, not literally, of course. In fact it may be the UK’s northernmost country’s very chilliness that has made it such a popular destination for hit program-makers of late: the foreboding landscapes and ominous grey skies of Scotland are perfect for generating the sort of atmosphere that makers of crime drama, in particular, are always after.</p> <p>And those makers are flocking to the north: from the windswept wilds of <em>Shetland</em> to the grimmer urban environs of <em>Karen Pirie</em> and the Irvine Welsh adaptation <em>Crime</em>, Scottish settings are proving their worth.</p> <p>And that’s before you even get to the matter of accents: the rugged burr of a Highland brogue (disclaimer: this author is Australian and doesn’t really know how to classify Scottish accents) might have been tailor-made for crime TV. Just hearing the word “crime” in a Scots accent is remarkably evocative.</p> <p>The latest Scottish caper of misdeeds and mayhem is <em>Payback</em>, which stars faces familiar to connoisseurs of fine television in Peter Mullan and Morven Christie. Christie nominates the massively popular fantasy series <em>Outlander</em> for giving a boost to Scottish productions.</p> <p>“I think that something did happen from <em>Outlander</em>, which is that it created a big sort of studio complex, and they also trained up a lot of crew, so over the years that <em>Outlander</em>’s been running, there’s been essentially a kind of training system. And it’s a beautiful country,” she adds, “so it’s an obvious choice for a lot of people to shoot here – it’s incredibly beautiful and there’s really skilled crew.”</p> <p>It does mean a lot for actors like Christie and Mullan to be able to work in their native land and in their own accents, with both having spent much of their careers travelling elsewhere and adopting all kinds of voices. Doing a show like <em>Payback</em> must be a special experience on that front? “Yeah, absolutely,” says Christie. “Kind of rare for me, actually.” Mullan agrees. “<em>Payback</em> was the first I’ve worked in Scotland for seven years, something like that.”</p> <p>In fact, the subject of production in his home country is one that Mullan is passionate about, and quite willing to expound on. Despite the impression gained from the outside that Scotland is attracting myriad productions, “from where I’m standing it doesn’t feel like there’s a lot of stuff happening in Scotland,” he says.</p> <p>“It feels like there’s nowhere near enough, in television and especially in cinema. We’re down to maybe, if we’re lucky, one film a year, which is really shocking.” He adds that setting a show in Scotland doesn’t necessarily make a show, at its heart, Scottish.</p> <p>“Things like <em>Payback</em>, they don’t feel particularly Scottish to me, they feel like they’re set in Scotland. It’s not specifically, culturally, Scottish, it could be set anywhere. I suspect they might’ve been given some state bribes to take it to Scotland – or subsidies as they call it. To be honest, it’s the one form of state bribery I’ve no issue with at all.”</p> <p>If <em>Payback</em> is not specifically Scottish, Mullan certainly is, sticking up for his country in a voice that could come straight from the Battle of Culloden. He’s also quite intimidating: although cheerful and friendly throughout the interview, there’s just something about his fearsome growl that can’t help but conjure images of some of the frightening characters he’s inhabited over a long career.</p> <p>Antipodean viewers will especially remember his indelible turn in Jane Campion’s <em>Top of the Lake</em>, where he played the terrifying patriarch of a crime family in spine-freezing style – it’s a miracle his co-stars could get their lines out opposite him. <em>Payback</em> sees him essay another menacing crime lord, the powerful and extremely dangerous Cal Morris. Christie, meanwhile, stars as Lexie Noble, the widow of Morris’ former accountant, who is roped in to a police operation to ensnare Morris. As such she spends most of the show treading a tightrope between cops and crims, and living in constant fear of Morris’ well-deserved reputation should she be exposed.</p> <p>Mullan laughs at the suggestion that scaring people might come naturally to him. “No, it’s a freak of nature,” he declares. “I’ve had this voice since I was really young. My voice broke very early, and my teachers used to say, ‘Peter, stop it!’ And I was only f---in’ 11, and I was talking like a f---in’ coal miner! It held me in good stead, cos I didn’t get in that many fights: I didn’t have to. That and the face, obviously, it’s all quirks of nature, it’s not that I’m a particularly intimidating person.”</p> <p>Here, Christie chimes in: “D’you know what, though: you’ve got one of the softest, friendliest faces I’ve ever seen. It’s just that when you play a baddie, you use your soft friendly face, and that makes it scarier. You’re one of the least scary people I’ve ever met: you’ve just got a very clever way of utilising your cheeky friendly softness that’s, you know, terrifying.”</p> <p>When a show requires one star to be terrifying and the other to be terrified, one might imagine it can get fairly stressful. On a tense, dark thriller like <em>Payback</em>, can the mood of the story infect the players themselves? Is it difficult for an actor to immerse themselves in a stressful fictional environment, then shrug that stress off at the end of the day? For Christie that particular challenge didn’t trouble her: while the mood was dark on screen, there was nothing uncomfortable on set. “The most fearful I ever was in scenes was in scenes with Peter, and while I didn’t switch from terrified to rolling in the aisles, there wasn’t an attempt to create some kind of weird environment: we’re just two actors who really enjoy working together and really enjoy each other’s company. I didn’t ever feel like I was being bullied, I felt like I had a really great pal.”</p> <p>Perhaps it takes really great pals to create the kind of unnerving enmity found at the centre of <em>Payback</em>. Though obviously it also helps when you’ve got a stunning landscape and the coolest accents north of Hadrian’s Wall.</p> <p><strong><em>Payback</em> premieres on Britbox on October 19.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",
