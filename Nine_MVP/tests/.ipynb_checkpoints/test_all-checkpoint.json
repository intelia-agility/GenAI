People are carrying a large red cross. The scene appears to depict a religious or theatrical representation of the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nThe narrator states that demons and Satan are used by the Potter's House Church to instill fear and control.\n\nThe scene changes to a different stage performance with purple lighting. People in costumes, some with masks and chains, are acting out a scene. A man is dragged away by a figure in a hooded costume with a demonic mask. Fake blood is visible on the man's neck and face.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the woman from the beginning, now sitting on a couch with a woman with blonde hair. They are having a conversation.\n\n**Woman 1:** Why did they show you these movies?\n\n**Woman 2:** To scare us. To follow what we were being taught. To scare us that if we weren't living the lifestyle they wanted, then we would be stuck in hell on earth.\n\nThe scene transitions to a sunset over the ocean. A woman with long dark hair is shown on a beach, looking out at the sea. The narrator says that Amy Higginson was born into the Potter's House and grew up knowing nothing else.\n\nA clip from an old movie is shown. A man in a military helmet asks, \"Do you wish to renounce your faith in your God?\" The scene then shows a woman being forced into a guillotine-like device.\n\nThe scene returns to the two women on the couch. They are watching the movie clip on a laptop.\n\n**Woman 1:** Even today, the movies still terrify her.\n\nA clip from the movie is shown again, this time depicting the ground splitting open.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the two women on the couch.\n\n**Woman 2:** It's hard to watch.\n\nWoman 2 begins to cry.\n\n**Woman 1:** What's that bringing up for you?\n\n**Woman 2:** I just lived in fear of what my future looked like if I wasn't doing exactly what I was told to be a good Christian and to follow an extensive set of rules and expectations of life. And so the fear was prominent in there all the time.\n\nThe scene shifts back to the beach, with the woman looking out at the ocean. The narrator says that Amy lived her young life constantly nervous that if she did something wrong, demons would grow inside her.\n\n**Woman 2 (in a different setting):** The word that my dad used was they were manifesting inside me. And that number would multiply until I had potentially thousands of demons inside me, which would be harder and harder to remove and to get rid of.\n\n**Woman 1 (in a different setting):** What were you doing that was wrong? What was considered bad behavior?\n\n**Woman 2:** Even something as simple as listening to non-Christian music or reading a book that was non-Christian would be considered bad behavior.\n\nThe scene returns to the beach, with the woman now sitting and watching the sunset.\n\nThe narrator says that both Amy and Katrina left the church as young adults. The scene shows Katrina, a woman with long brown hair, standing by a river at sunset, looking at a city skyline.\n\nThe scene changes to a night scene of a highway accident. A police car is heavily damaged, and a truck is visible in the background. The narrator says that neither Amy nor Katrina were shocked to hear of the link between the extreme sect and the tragedy on the Melbourne Freeway in 2020.\n\nA group of people in suits are walking down a city street. The narrator says that they can understand why the trucking boss, Simon Tuteru, thought prayer would fix the drug-addicted truck driver's problems.\n\nA man with a white beard is shown praying, placing his hand on another man's head.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the woman with long brown hair from the beginning.\n\n**Woman:** When I heard about the news, no doubt at all. I just was like, that is bang on what they do.\n\n**Woman 2:** The fact that he believed in voodoo and didn't see it as someone who needed serious help doesn't surprise me at all. And yeah, he believed that what he was doing was the right thing.\n\n**Woman 1:** And instead of telling him to get help,\n\n**Woman 2:** He prayed with him and cast a spell out of him.\n\n**Woman 2:** For the Potter's House, that's just normal. And something that they genuinely believe. In reality, I feel like anyone else would have known how to respond in that situation.\n\nA bald man is shown looking out a window with orange-tinted glass.\n\n**Woman 1:** Do you feel some remorse, even guilt, when you do hear these stories that occurred when you were the leader of the church?\n\n**Bald Man:** Absolutely. And you know, the first couple of years that I came out of the Potter's House, every time I saw an ex-member, I just began the conversation with an apology. I was certainly never apologizing for any of the extreme acts that you've you've mentioned, but you know, I recognized I was a part of it. And I've been there since I was 19 years old, grew up in it, got very used to it, uh, and just didn't see the errors and the extreme that were there.\n\n**Woman 1:** What's your message for pastors in the Potter's House now?\n\n**Bald Man:** My my word to the Potter's House leaders would be rejoin the mainstream Christian church, allow them to bring that community correction in areas where they've overbalanced or gone into extreme. Allow those outside voices that will bring them back before anything else really serious happens.\n\nA group of people on a stage are singing and waving money. The narrator says that when Potter's House senior member Simon Tuteru chose to pray for his exhausted truck driver and advised him to get back behind the wheel, four police officers lost their lives.\n\nPhotos of four police officers are shown.\n\nSimon Tuteru is shown walking down the street with two other people. The narrator says that three months after the tragedy, Victoria Police charged Tuteru with four counts of manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty, and a trial date was set. But in October last year, inexplicably, the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions dropped all the charges.\n\nSimon Tuteru is shown walking through a parking lot.\n\nThe narrator says that these days, Simon Tuteru is no longer a pastor but is still a senior member of the church. When they contacted him, he refused to tell them anything about what happened on that terrible afternoon three years ago. The church also wouldn't comment.\n\nThe Potter's House Church building is shown from an aerial view.\n\nA man with long white hair and a beard is sitting on a couch with Woman 1. They are looking at a photo album.\n\n**Woman 1:** How does it feel then knowing that Simon Tuteru is a free man? He's still attending church. He's getting on with his life.\n\n**Man:** Frustrated that he is. Frustrated he's not faced court for anything. And it riles to to anger almost. That's how it feels. Shouldn't have happened.\n\nThe man points to a photo in the album of a woman sitting on a deck at sunset.\n\n**Man:** That's the sunset where our house is. And there she's sitting on the deck with that sunset.\n\nThe man points to another photo of the same woman smiling in a car.\n\n**Man:** But Stuart Schultz is even more angry about the continued existence of the Potter's House Church.\n\nA banner on a fence reads, \"COME AND RECEIVE A MIRACLE. HOPE, JOY, PEACE, HEALING, LIFE, A NEW FUTURE.\"\n\n**Man:** Now that he understands the role the church played in the death of his wife and her three colleagues, he's calling for an inquiry into the church to make sure more accidents like this don't happen again. There's three levels of blame. The driver of the truck, uh, Tuteru, he was the manager. If Potter's House is what's influenced Tuteru to make those decisions to make single drive back on the road, uh, they're to blame as well.\n\n**Woman 1:** So justice for you now means everyone who had a role\n\n**Man:** Yes.\n\n**Man:** They've got to be held to account for Kevin, Josh, and Glenn, and Lynette, and their families all need to have closure. They all need to have justice.\n\nA clock face with the words \"60 MINUTES\" is shown. The second hand moves from 0 to 30 seconds. The words \"COMING UP\" appear.\n\nA montage of clips is shown, featuring Hugh Sheridan in various roles and settings.\n\nA woman with short blonde hair, wearing a red suit, is sitting on a stool in front of a red curtain. A poster behind her reads \"WHO'S HUGH?\"\n\n**Woman:** There's no dispute. Hugh Sheridan is one of the nicest people you could ever meet. On screen and in the theater, he's also one of Australia's finest and most loved actors. So, how does anyone make sense of this? In 2020, he became the target of a vile hate campaign that almost broke him. And the reason he was attacked so viciously…\n\nThe word \"NEXT\" appears.\n\nThe clock face with \"60 MINUTES\" is shown again.\n\nThe woman in the red suit is shown again.\n\n**Woman:** …is attacking an ally, isn't it?\n\nHugh Sheridan is shown in an interview setting.\n\n**Hugh Sheridan:** I would have thought so, yeah.\n\nThe word \"NEXT\" appears again.\n\nThe clock face with \"60 MINUTES\" is shown again.\n\nThe woman in the red suit is shown again.\n\n**Woman:** Goodbye, job.\n\nA shirtless Hugh Sheridan is shown with tape over his mouth and the word \"FRAGILE\" written on it. The word \"CANCELLED\" is superimposed over the image.\n\nHugh Sheridan is shown walking by the water in a blue tank top.\n\n**Woman:** So why did the trolls cancel Hugh Sheridan?\n\nHugh Sheridan is shown in an interview setting.\n\n**Hugh Sheridan:** I just love entertaining people. And that's all I've ever wanted to do since I was little.\n\nHugh Sheridan is shown on stage in a white suit with a microphone.\n\nHugh Sheridan is shown in a dressing room, wearing a leopard print robe.\n\nHugh Sheridan is shown in an interview setting.\n\n**Woman:** …it’s attacking an ally, isn’t it?\n\n**Hugh Sheridan:** I would have thought so, yeah.\n\nThe word \"NEXT\" appears again.\n\nThe clock face with \"60 MINUTES\" is shown again.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n60 Minutes\nHurley\nCalvin Klein\nConnect Logistics\nThe Potters House Christian Fellowship Church\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\nInterview setting with a woman in a black top\nStage performance with a red cross\nStage performance with demonic masks and chains\nInterview setting with two women on a couch\nBeach at sunset\nOld movie clip\nInterview setting with a woman in a pink sweater\nHighway accident scene\nCity street with people in suits\nMan praying for another man\nInterview setting with a woman in a teal top\nInterview setting with a bald man\nChurch service with people waving money\nPhoto album\nInterview setting with a man with a long white beard\nMontage of Hugh Sheridan clips\nStudio setting with a woman in a red suit\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\nReligious extremism\nFear and control in religious sects\nImpact of trauma on former cult members\nAccountability for harmful actions\nJustice for victims of tragedy\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\nAmy Higginson\nKatrina (last name not mentioned)\nSimon Tuteru\nDavid Vickery\nStuart Schultz\nHugh Sheridan\nKevin, Josh, Glenn, and Lynette (victims of the freeway accident)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.22135042,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.2407752},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21337745,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.2643585},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.3584656,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.2917871},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.16776322,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.23793007}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":2642,"promptTokenCount":843053,"totalTokenCount":845695}}}

The scene then shifts to the wedding ceremony, where Tayla, wearing a white dress and veil, smiles at Hugo. She expresses her difficulty in seeing through the veil. Hugo, wearing a navy blue tuxedo, smiles and lifts her veil, revealing her face. The guests, including two bridesmaids in pink dresses, watch the ceremony with smiles and tears of joy.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Tayla is asked about her thoughts on her new husband. She admits that he's not her usual type, \"definitely not my type at all.\" Back at the ceremony, Tayla begins to read her vows. She mentions that marrying a stranger wouldn't surprise her family and friends, as they know her search for a partner is a driving force. She playfully warns Hugo that she can be explosive and has a problem with authority, not liking to be told what to do. She hopes this won't be a point of contention for them. She also emphasizes the importance of loyalty to her.\n\nHugo, in his vows, expresses how stunning and beautiful Tayla looks. He acknowledges the scariness of marrying a stranger but finds Tayla's initial comment about his name being similar to her ex's funny and a sign that they're on the same wavelength. He assures her that he'll always be in her corner, make her smile every day, and pick her up when she falls, literally or figuratively. He promises to order something different when they eat out so they can swap if they don't like their own dishes. He also promises to hate whoever they need to hate that week, not send it on Saturdays if they have quiet Sunday plans, and dance with her even when the music is over. Joking aside, he expresses his belief that they are the product of their relationships, be it with family, friends, or partners, and hopes to make her feel safe, special, desired, and most importantly, loved.\n\nTayla finds Hugo's vows sweet and appreciates his words about being in her corner. She admits it was strange but nice to hear such sentiments. The officiant then pronounces them husband and wife, and the guests erupt in applause as the couple shares their first kiss. They walk down the aisle, hand-in-hand, smiling at their guests.\n\nThe scene transitions to the reception, where Tayla and Hugo join their guests. A woman in a black dress expresses her overwhelming emotions and feels like she let Jesse down, though she blames herself. The scene shifts to another wedding, where Evelyn and Rupert are about to start their big day. Rupert, the groom, is seen getting ready in his hotel room, adjusting his suit and checking his wedding ring. Evelyn is shown in her wedding dress, receiving compliments from her mother and sister.\n\nThe scene moves to the wedding venue, where guests are arriving and taking their seats. Rupert expresses his nervousness about the vows and speech. He drops the rings, causing amusement among the guests. He admits to feeling sick and questioning his decision. The scene cuts to Evelyn's family arriving at the venue. Her mother asks if the man walking down the aisle is the best man, only to be corrected that it's the groom.\n\nAt another wedding, Claire is contemplating confessing to Jesse about a kiss she shared with Adam, unbeknownst to Adam. Adam and Janelle are shown at the reception, enjoying the celebration and reflecting on their own wedding. Rupert, meanwhile, is still feeling nervous as he waits for his bride to arrive.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Pierre Diamonds (on the ring box)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Rooftop with city view (Hugo's pre-wedding interview)\n* Wedding ceremony venue (Tayla and Hugo's wedding)\n* Rooftop with city view and bridge (Tayla's post-wedding interview)\n* Wedding reception venue (Tayla and Hugo's reception)\n* Hotel room (Rupert getting ready)\n* Apartment (Evelyn getting ready)\n* Wedding venue exterior (Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney)\n* Wedding reception venue (Evelyn and Rupert's wedding)\n* Car interior (Rupert traveling to the venue)\n* Street outside wedding venue (Rupert walking to the venue)\n* Wedding venue interior (Evelyn and Rupert's wedding)\n* Bar area (Adam's interview)\n* City skyline (Sydney)\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Marriage\n* Relationships\n* Weddings\n* Nerves and anxiety\n* Honesty and communication\n* Love and commitment\n* Family and friends\n* Celebrations\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Hugo (groom)\n* Tayla (bride)\n* Taylor (Hugo's ex-partner, mentioned)\n* Bridesmaids\n* Wedding guests\n* Officiant\n* Producer (asking Tayla about her thoughts)\n* Evelyn (bride)\n* Rupert (groom)\n* Evelyn's mother\n* Evelyn's sister\n* Claire (bride, mentioned)\n* Jesse (groom, mentioned)\n* Adam (groom, mentioned)\n* Janelle (bride, mentioned)\n\n\nThis comprehensive description provides a detailed account of the events, conversations, and individuals featured in the specified segment of the video, adhering to the requested format and word count."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09534948,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.111241356},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.10230474,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17441037},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14033636,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1755382},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.38075927,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.35131136}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1187,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178425}}}

She states, \"because I've never been that for somebody before.\" The scene then shifts to a different setting, where three individuals are seated on a brown leather couch. The woman on the left wears a purple dress, the woman in the center is dressed in a pink pantsuit, and the man on the right wears a dark suit and jeans. A man with his back to the camera, wearing a light-colored t-shirt, is seated in front of them, facing away.\n\nThe scene transitions to a close-up of a different blonde woman crying, wiping tears from her eyes with her right hand. She is seated on a couch with a light-colored pillow behind her. A man's hand, wearing a brown watch, is visible resting on his chin in the foreground on the left. Another man's shoulder is partially visible on the right.\n\nThe scene returns to Caitlin, who continues, \"But this here, this isn't what I wanted.\" The camera then focuses on a man in a dark suit, who appears to be listening intently, his expression serious. Caitlin adds, \"And if I'm being honest, if I could do it all over again with someone else, I would. Because I deserve that chance, but this man does not deserve me.\"\n\nThe scene changes to Caitlin and a man sitting on a green couch. Caitlin has her arms crossed, while the man has his hand on his chin, appearing deep in thought. The camera zooms in on the man's face, showing a concerned expression. He then brings his hand to his mouth, as Caitlin announces, \"So I will be leaving.\"\n\nA woman in a bright blue blazer is shown crying, wiping tears from her eyes with both hands. A man with a beard, wearing a black shirt, sits beside her, his expression solemn. The scene cuts back to Caitlin and the man on the green couch, both looking serious.\n\nThe man in the dark suit from earlier then speaks, addressing Caitlin directly, \"Good. What's worthwhile pointing out here, Caitlin, is that this experiment, at times for you, got really, really nasty. But throughout all of that, you maintained your dignity. You kept believing that maybe you could turn this around. And let me be very clear, you are worthy. You are a great catch. And you will make someone very happy.\"\n\nCaitlin responds with a simple, \"Thank you.\" The scene shows other participants reacting to Caitlin's departure. A woman with long brown hair, wearing a floral one-shoulder dress, claps her hands. Others are shown with various expressions of sadness and support.\n\nCaitlin is shown smiling slightly, and the man in the dark suit continues, \"Thank you.\" The man on the green couch with Caitlin is shown looking down, his hand on his forehead. He then stands up and picks up a small, dark object from the couch.\n\nThe scene shifts to a wider shot of the room, showing Caitlin walking away, followed by the man who was sitting with her. Other participants are seated on couches and chairs around the room. Caitlin walks towards a group of women, who embrace her. One of them says, \"You're incredible.\" The man who was sitting with Caitlin walks towards a door and exits the room.\n\nThe scene transitions to a preview of the next episode, showing various wedding scenes and couples. A voiceover says, \"Next time, two brand new couples enter the experiment.\" A woman in a wedding dress is shown walking, followed by a close-up of her holding a bouquet of flowers. A man in a suit is also shown walking. Another woman in a wedding dress is shown walking along a brick wall. A wedding ceremony is shown, with a groom nervously fumbling with his vows.

The narrator states that the man, Chris Ridgeway, profited $1.6 million from a questionable global financial scheme. The narrator adds that millions more invested by Ridgeway's clients are now missing. Ridgeway claims he doesn't know what happened to the money, although he says others likely do.\n\nThe scene cuts to a parking garage, where a man in a gray hoodie is shown. The audio plays Ridgeway stating that David Sutton would know where the money went.\n\nThe scene transitions to Ridgeway in a blue and white checkered shirt, sitting in a dimly lit room with a potted plant behind him. He reiterates that David Sutton would know where the money went, suggesting the reporter ask Sutton if given the opportunity.\n\nThe scene cuts to a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a red blazer and a necklace. She appears to be in an interview setting.\n\nRidgeway is shown again, this time looking to his left with a slightly surprised expression.\n\nAn aerial shot reveals a large house with a pool, nestled among trees. The narrator states that David Sutton lives in a wealthy suburb on Sydney's Northern Beaches.\n\nThe scene cuts to a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a black blazer, walking towards a closed garage door. She approaches a side door and knocks several times, calling out for David Sutton and identifying herself as Adele Ferguson from 60 Minutes.\n\nThe scene briefly returns to the aerial shot of Sutton's house.\n\nThe woman in the black blazer is then shown using her phone, presumably trying to contact Sutton. The scene changes to a beach setting, where the same woman is standing on the sand, holding her phone to her ear. Sutton's voicemail message plays, indicating that the call went unanswered.\n\nA close-up of a phone screen shows a text message conversation. Sutton replies to Adele Ferguson via text, stating that his legal advice is not to speak to the media.\n\nThe scene changes to a brick house with a white door. A woman with dark hair, wearing a gray jacket and pearl earrings, knocks on the door. The narrator explains that they also tried to contact Sutton's business partner in England, Andy Turner, to inquire about the missing money.\n\nThe camera focuses on a window of the brick house.\n\nThe woman at the door is shown again, this time speaking to a man who answers the door. The man is bald, wearing glasses and a dark gray t-shirt. He appears to be on the phone. The woman asks for Mr. Turner.\n\nThe narrator states that Turner sent a statement denying any wrongdoing.\n\nRidgeway is shown walking in a park area, carrying his suit jacket over his arm. He is wearing a light pink and white checkered shirt and a red and white striped tie.\n\nThe scene cuts back to Ridgeway in the dimly lit room, now wearing a watch. He says that he's been hung out to dry and that he's been the fall person in all of this. He adds that others are happy and have done nothing to help him.\n\nThe scene changes to a room with a large oval table, where several people are sitting and talking to a woman in a red and black patterned blazer. The woman is holding a pen and paper. One of the people at the table mentions intermediaries getting paid a lot of commission. Another person states that the people who trusted their money with Ridgeway have no sympathy for him.\n\nThe scene focuses on a man with short graying hair, wearing a blue and white checkered shirt. He says that it's time for action to be taken.\n\nThe scene cuts to a woman with short white hair, wearing a dark blue shirt. She suggests that the directors of the entities they invested in are likely planning their next company. She emphasizes that they need to be stopped.\n\nThe scene returns to the man in the blue and white checkered shirt, who agrees that they need to be stopped.\n\nThe scene cuts to a man with thinning white hair, wearing a white shirt. He is identified as former senator John Williams, who has been trying to help the investors who lost their money. He criticizes ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission) for being ineffectual. He accuses ASIC of being the definition of frustration and says that they have been trying to get ASIC to act for 11 years. He adds that there is no fear of punishment for wrongdoing, as people can siphon off commissions, break the law, and steal money without consequence.\n\nThe woman in the red and black patterned blazer asks what message this sends to criminals when ASIC doesn't act.\n\nThe former senator replies that it sends a message that there is no fear of punishment.\n\nRidgeway is shown walking in a covered walkway, wearing a blue and white checkered shirt. He says that after years of deceit, finally coming clean to his clients and family has been his only option. He is asked what he thinks will happen. He replies that he may never be able to be a financial advisor again, may not be able to be a company director, and may end up being charged with fraud and going to jail. He expresses fear and horror at this prospect.\n\nThe woman in the red blazer asks Ridgeway if he says he's sorry for his actions, and if she believes him. Ridgeway's wife, a woman with blonde hair and black glasses, says she doesn't know. She says that she spoke to him at Christmas and was prepared to listen to what he had to say. He told her and their children that he was sorry and wanted to fix things. She later found out that he was having an affair with someone else, which was another level of betrayal and lies. She says she doesn't know the answer to whether she believes him.\n\nThe woman in the red blazer asks Ridgeway what he would say to his wife and kids. Ridgeway, now crying, apologizes and says he didn't mean for this to happen. He just wanted them to have a good life.\n\nThe scene transitions to a graphic with the title \"The Confession\" and the producer's name. A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a black blazer, sits in front of the graphic. She states that Ridgeway's former employer, Shore and Partners, says he deliberately circumvented the company's compliance procedures to deceive them. She adds that Shores is working to compensate the impacted parties. She also mentions that ASIC has permanently banned Ridgeway from any involvement in financial services.\n\nThe scene transitions to a graphic that says \"Coming Up.\" A man in a suit is walking on a bridge in a city. He is identified as Victor Gao, a former diplomat and expert in Chinese affairs, who is an unofficial mouthpiece for the communist regime. He says that many people in China consider bans by foreign countries to be a laughingstock because it reveals their weaknesses and inferiority. He adds that Australia should be confident about its own system rather than being threatened by TikTok. He says that such bans are racist and discriminatory.\n\nA woman in a red blazer is shown sitting in front of a graphic with the title \"The TikToking Time Bomb.\" She says that TikTok has been banned from Australian government phones and devices due to its Chinese ownership, which has angered the Chinese Communist Party. She adds that the CCP has warned Australia not to treat Beijing as the enemy.\n\nA montage of TikTok videos is shown. The narrator says that despite its fun and frivolity, TikTok is in serious strife. The world's fastest-growing social media platform has been banned on government devices in the US, Canada, and across Europe, then in Australia.\n\nA woman in a blue and white patterned blazer is shown speaking in front of Australian flags. She says that the ban has been informed by security agencies' advice.\n\nA man in a suit and tie is shown speaking. He says that TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a China-founded company with a different approach to privacy.\n\nA woman in a white shirt is shown speaking. She says that most people would think TikTok is just like any other app, but it is different because of where it comes from.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n60 Minutes\nTikTok\nByteDance\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\nCity street\nParking garage\nInterview room\nHouse with a pool\nGarage door\nSide door\nBeach\nBrick house with a white door\nPark area\nRoom with a large oval table\nCovered walkway\n60 Minutes studio\nBridge in a city\nAustralian Parliament House\nAustralian Coat of Arms\nTikTok videos\nAustralian government press conference\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\nFinancial fraud\nMissing money\nAccountability\nGovernment regulation\nTikTok ban\nNational security\nChina-Australia relations\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\nChris Ridgeway\nDavid Sutton\nAdele Ferguson\nAndy Turner\nJohn Williams\nVictor Gao"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.23370646,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20689407},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20946948,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.31742668},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2727994,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.22000723},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09534948,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.122523345}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1866,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":179104}}}

They are having a serious conversation. Lindall mentions that it's 8 pm. Cameron responds that they are not in a position where they can take things as they are. He continues, saying that if one of her friends saw him doing something to her and she didn't know, he would be burned down to the ground. Lindall interjects, saying, \"You would burn down buildings.\" Cameron responds, \"Making assumptions.\" Lindall then expresses feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place, with the rock being herself and the hard place being Cam. She feels somewhere in the middle of the moment.\n\nThe scene transitions to the couple entering a room where other people are gathered. They are greeted with cheers and applause. The scene cuts to three people sitting at a table, a woman in a red blazer, a woman in a blue shirt, and a man in a black suit. The woman in red says, \"Lindall and Cameron.\" The scene then cuts back to the couple entering the room, hugging and greeting people. The woman in red at the table comments that they seemed to be entering as two separate entities. The man in the suit agrees, saying it was a lukewarm entrance.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the room, showing the couple mingling with the other guests. The scene then transitions back to the three people at the table, who are now watching the gathering on a television screen. The man in the suit mentions that Cam and Lindall were loved up when they last saw them, but tonight there's a little frostiness between them.\n\nThe scene cuts to Cam sitting on a couch with two other men. One of the men asks what happened this morning. Cam replies that something happened on the weekend with someone else. The other man asks what he means. Cam says they will probably hear about it. The man asks if it's causing an issue between the two of them. Cam confirms that it is. The man then asks if it involves him, and Cam says no. He likes to stay in his own lane. The other man asks if it's causing an issue between Cam and Lindall, and Cam confirms again. The man then asks who they are talking about, but Cam doesn't want to say. He doesn't want it to get out there and doesn't want to jump in out of his lane.\n\nThe scene transitions to Lindall talking to two other women. She says she saw someone out with someone they shouldn't have been out with, and she might have taken it the wrong way. She adds that their partner might not know about it. One of the women asks if it's Adam, but Lindall says no.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the three people at the table. The woman in blue says that Lindall saw Shannon with another woman on the weekend. The man in the suit points out that Shannon already said she's in love with her ex, and asks if that's the person they're talking about. The woman in blue confirms.\n\nThe scene cuts back to Lindall talking to the two other women. She says it could be entirely wrong, and she hopes she is. The scene then transitions back to the three people at the table. The man in the suit says he's looking forward to hearing what Caitlin has to say about this, because if Shannon's caught up with her ex and people have seen it happen, it's a double blow for Caitlin. He adds that Caitlin is finding out at the dinner party.\n\nThe scene cuts to Caitlin in a car. She says that this week, Shannon has disrespected, degraded, and insulted her. She's going in tonight to show Shannon that she is strong. If Shannon apologizes, she will let it go and move on, but if Shannon doesn't, game's over.\n\nThe scene transitions to Caitlin getting out of the car and entering the building where the dinner party is being held. The scene cuts back to the three people at the table. The woman in red says, \"Alyssa and Duncan.\" The scene then cuts to Alyssa and Duncan entering the room, holding hands. They are greeted by the other guests. The woman in red comments that they look like Barbie and Ken.\n\nThe scene cuts to Alyssa talking to the other women. She says she's so proud to be next to Duncan and walk into the dinner party hand in hand. She adds that intimacy week brought her out of her shell and allowed her to have conversations she would never normally have. She feels like she's doing something bad, but afterward, she feels free and normal.\n\nThe scene transitions to Alyssa talking to the other guests. She says it's good, they're just taking their time and seeing how things go. The scene cuts back to the women on the couch. Caitlin says it's been a week. Another woman agrees, saying it's been a [expletive] week. Caitlin says she can't wait any longer and asks the other women to tell her how they are. Caitlin says she's okay, just in a bit of a battle with herself. She doesn't want to come in and throw Shannon under the bus, especially because she doesn't know how Shannon will react. If Shannon comes in waving a white flag with an apology, she doesn't want to exacerbate the situation by having said everything. But if Shannon comes in guns blazing, she's going to need support. Caitlin says she's sorry, she shouldn't have said that, but the other women reassure her. Caitlin says the main thing for her is that yesterday morning, she and Shannon had an argument over the weekend. They sat down, and Shannon said he's not attracted to her. There is no attraction there. He said she's a good-looking girl, not to him. He said if someone wowed him when he walked down the aisle, he would have cut off his ex then and there, and that's what he was expecting. He was kicking her where it was low. He said if someone wowed him when he walked down the aisle, he would have cut off his ex then and there, and that's what he was expecting.\n\nThe scene cuts to Caitlin talking to the other women. She says she saw Shannon with his ex and his kid, and when she said hi to him in the street, he just walked away. She asks if Shannon is still seeing his ex. Another woman says that as far as she's aware, he has blocked her. Lindall says she saw them together, and Caitlin asks if she's sure. Lindall says she saw them together. Caitlin says she's going to ask Shannon about it, but she doesn't want to take on any more than she needs to. She says she's sorry, she shouldn't have said that. The other women reassure her. Caitlin says she needs to know, and asks if Shannon is still seeing his ex. Another woman says that as far as she's aware, he has blocked her.

The scene shows several plants enclosed in clear containers in a laboratory setting. The news anchor mentions that Sydney's University of Technology has discovered how plants remove toxic petrol fumes from indoor air. This is described as a \"handy revelation for city dwellers,\" as petrol fumes are linked to an increased risk of cancer and asthma.\n\nThe next segment focuses on a breakthrough treatment for paralysis using artificial intelligence. The anchor introduces a story about Swiss neuroscientists who have enabled a paralyzed man to walk again. The man, Gert-Jan Oskam, is shown walking with the assistance of a walker and wearing a device on his head. The technology involves a \"digital bridge\" that re-establishes communication between the brain and the spinal cord. This is achieved through electronic implants, one in the brain and another over the spinal cord. The patient has to learn how to work with his brain signals and how to correlate these signals to the spinal cord stimulation. Gert-Jan Oskam, the patient, shares his experience, expressing his joy at being able to stand and have a beer with his friends after ten years. The technology is described as \"transforming thought into action.\" The researchers hope to extend this technology to restore arm and hand functions as well.\n\nThe news then shifts to a preview of Vivid Sydney, the largest drone show in the Southern Hemisphere. Secret rehearsals for the show, \"Written in the Stars,\" have taken place at Eastern Creek. The show is part of the Vivid Festival. John Graham, Minister for Jobs and Tourism, expresses his excitement about the event, emphasizing its scale and uniqueness. The news anchor encourages viewers to use public transport to get to the city for the festival.\n\nFinally, the news transitions to the weather segment. The weather presenter, Amber, gives a brief overview of the current temperature in Sydney, which is 17 degrees in the city and 12 degrees in the west. She then provides a more detailed weather report for Sydney and New South Wales. Today's weather in Sydney was cold and sunny, with warmer temperatures in the water than on land. A rare sighting of a blue whale off the coast of Terrigal was also reported. The temperatures in various Sydney suburbs reached a high of 18 to 21 degrees. The rest of New South Wales experienced a dry and cool day with sunny skies in the northeast and partly cloudy skies in the west and south. The forecast for tomorrow includes a cold front reaching the New South Wales coast with strong wind gusts exceeding 80 kilometers per hour, bringing showers. Light showers are expected across southern, central, and coastal New South Wales, with possible snow down to 1200 meters and light falls around the central tablelands. Temperatures across most of the state will be several degrees below average, and a gale-force wind warning is in effect from Byron Bay to the Illawarra coast, with a strong wind warning for the far south. Sydney's forecast for tomorrow is cloudy with showers and moderate to fresh northwesterly winds, stronger along the coast. There is a 70% chance of up to 6 millimeters of rain in the city and 1 or 2 millimeters, if any, in the west. The cloud cover will lead to a milder night tonight. Tomorrow's temperatures will reach 17 to 18 degrees across the western suburbs and 16 to 18 degrees across the coast. Looking ahead, the skies will clear for the weekend with sunshine and tops of 18 to 19 degrees. Next week is expected to be slightly warmer, with tops of 20 to 21 degrees from Monday to Wednesday. Thursday, the first day of winter, is predicted to be warm with a high of 22 degrees. In the west, the weather will be sunny and 19 degrees across the weekend, staying fine with tops of 21 degrees early next week. Nights will remain chilly, ranging from 9 degrees tonight to a low of 2 degrees.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\nNine News\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Laboratory setting with plants in containers\n* Cityscape of Sydney\n* Park with a man walking using a walker\n* Indoor rehabilitation facility\n* Outdoor park with a lake\n* Drone show rehearsal field at Eastern Creek\n* Vivid Sydney festival lights\n* Nine News studio with weather map and graphics\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Environmental benefits of indoor plants\n* Breakthrough technology for paralysis treatment\n* Vivid Sydney festival and drone show\n* Weather forecast for Sydney and New South Wales\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Peter Overton (news anchor)\n* Gert-Jan Oskam (paralysis patient)\n* Jocelyn Bloch (neuroscientist)\n* John Graham (Minister for Jobs and Tourism)\n* Amber (weather presenter)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.04146221,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.10970578},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2774732,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3073578},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.044680975,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.09268759},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09009325,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.07263684}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1020,"promptTokenCount":91688,"totalTokenCount":92708}}}

The first story is about a driveway execution near Liverpool. A young man was shot dead outside his home. The killers are on the run. The victim's father is overcome with grief. The killers waited for 15 minutes outside the victim's home. The victim's girlfriend, mother, and little sister had just walked inside after the school pickup when the gunmen made their move. The killers were captured on CCTV. They doused the getaway car in petrol and fled through a park. They then jumped into a black sedan. Neighbors say that car was parked on Lewis Street earlier that morning. Police believe the murder was an organized crime murder. The victim was a 24-year-old student named Marvin Oraiha. He was studying to be a project designer. He was a quiet and lovely boy. His family doesn't know why he was killed.\n\nThe next story is about two teenage boys who were allegedly assaulted outside Bonnyrigg Plaza. Two men have been arrested. The teenage boys are in the hospital.\n\nThe next story is about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Sydney. Thousands of people have descended on Olympic Park for the event. The celebrations are colorful and loud. Modi arrived in Sydney on a specially chartered Qantas 737, flying the faithful from Melbourne to Sydney. The plane was sold out. In Brisbane, it was the Modi Express, a chartered bus barreling down the Pacific Highway overnight for an appointment with their hero. Outside Mr. Modi's hotel in Sydney's CBD, there was presidential-style security, keeping the devotees at a safe distance. One devotee said Modi is a savior for India because he has freed India from corruption. In Harris Park, the epicenter of the Indian community in Sydney, they lived in hope of a Modi drive-by. This afternoon, the Modi show descended on Kudos Bank Arena. It was a 20,000-seat sellout. One attendee said it felt like early Christmas and Diwali for all of them. Another attendee said it was celebrating the friendship between Australia and India. The last time Prime Minister Modi was in Australia was 2014. The size of the Indian community then was just under 400,000. Since then, it has exploded to more than 720,000. In 10 years, there will be more than 1 million expat Indians in Australia. Moving through the crowd, you picked up a recurring belief: Modi had made them proud to be Indian.\n\nThe next story is about a brick cage dangling from a crane that swiped a double-decker bus on York Street, breaking windows. No one was injured in the accident, which happened outside a construction site just before 8 am. Construction company Zeros claims its traffic controllers tried to stop the bus, but Transport for New South Wales says security footage shows the driver followed safety instructions.\n\nThe next story is about a man who went on a shooting rampage before taking hostages near Wollongong. He has been acquitted of carrying out a terrorist attack. The case collapsed after the Crown failed to prove Simon Fleming was guilty.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Nine News Sydney\n* Qantas\n* Kudos Bank Arena\n* Zeros\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Liverpool\n* Bonnyrigg Plaza\n* Olympic Park, Sydney\n* Harris Park, Sydney\n* Sydney CBD\n* York Street, Sydney\n* Wollongong\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Crime\n* Politics\n* Accidents\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Marvin Oraiha\n* Narendra Modi\n* Simon Fleming\n* Anthony Blinken\n* Peter Dutton\n* Anthony Albanese\n* Charles Croucher\n* Mark Burrows\n* James Wilson\n* Virginia Gorman\n\nI hope this helps!"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20307489,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.23793007},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.3140506,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.4002808},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.3276681,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.24220619},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.13660881,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15713716}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":841,"promptTokenCount":807059,"totalTokenCount":807900}}}

He is wearing sunglasses and a black shirt. The reporters attempt to question him, but he remains silent. He is then escorted into a black car.\n\nBack in the studio, the news anchor, Peter Overton, introduces the weather segment with Amber Sherlock. Amber presents the weather forecast for Sydney, highlighting a cold night and sunny start to the day, with clouds moving in during the afternoon. She mentions light northwesterly winds, a city temperature of 8 degrees Celsius in the morning (4 degrees cooler than average), reaching a high of 19 degrees by midday.

Noah's mother, Mariana Chahine, expresses relief that her son was unharmed. The reporter, James Wilson, explains that the driver, a 71-year-old woman, suffered a medical episode, causing her to lose control of the car.\n\nThe news then shifts to breaking news about the fire emergency in Surry Hills. Peter Overton introduces a live interview with Acting Commissioner Jeremy Fewtrell from Fire and Rescue NSW. Bianca Balzer, the reporter on the scene, interviews Fewtrell, who describes the fire as intense and fast-developing but now contained. He mentions substantial damage to the two buildings involved and acknowledges the community's concern. He confirms that an investigation into the cause of the fire will be conducted in collaboration with police forensics.\n\nThe news returns to the school shooting in Perth. Peter Overton reports on the incident, where a 15-year-old boy allegedly fired three shots on his former campus. Bodycam footage shows police responding to the scene, securing the school, and arresting the boy. School bags are scattered in the hallways, and students are hiding under their desks. The boy's car is shown with two rifles and a gun bag on the front seat. Three bullet casings are found, one on the floor mat of the car, and bullet holes are visible in the school's demountable building. WA Premier Mark McGowan visits the school, praising the staff and students for their bravery. In a separate incident, police are searching for a man who held up a gun store in Busselton, stealing a rifle and ammunition.\n\nThe segment on King Charles and Queen Camilla shows them being serenaded by a school choir outside Belfast during their first visit to Northern Ireland since their coronation.

The snakes, nicknamed Toasty and Marshmallow, require special care in the lead-up to winter and hibernation. Staff are concerned about their well-being. The snakes, worth around $700 each, are the most sought-after carpet pythons. In a positive turn of events, the pythons were recovered by police from a St Clair home and returned to the store. A 17-year-old boy is speaking with police.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Nine News\n* GoGet\n* Kellyville Pets\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Cliff overlooking the ocean\n* Courtroom\n* News studio\n* Sydney city skyline\n* Surry Hills fire scene\n* Birrong sports field\n* Perth school\n* Coronation Garden in Belfast\n* Kingsford and Rosebery (Gardeners Road)\n* Narooma (South Coast)\n* Balgowlah Heights (Beatrice Street)\n* Kellyville Pet Store\n* St Clair home\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Crime (court case, school shooting, gun store robbery, reptile theft, bus surfing)\n* Accidents (car crash, fire emergency, car explosion)\n* Weather\n* Royal visit\n* Animal welfare\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Tiffany Genders (reporter)\n* Simon Gittany (court case subject)\n* Peter Overton (news anchor)\n* Amber Sherlock (weather presenter)\n* Jeremy Fewtrell (Acting Commissioner, Fire and Rescue NSW)\n* Bianca Balzer (reporter)\n* Alva Wallace (resident, Birrong)\n* Noah Alameddine (student, Birrong)\n* Mariana Chahine (Noah's mother)\n* James Wilson (reporter)\n* Mark McGowan (WA Premier)\n* Eddie Meyer (reporter)\n* King Charles\n* Queen Camilla\n* Will Densley (Kellyville Pets employee)\n* Ollie Newman (Kellyville Pets employee)\n* Elizabeth Bryan (reporter)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07585824,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15405777},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.3424617,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.35309324},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1431879,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.112795524},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09534948,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18952143}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1367,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178605}}}

Here's a detailed description of the video from 1200 seconds to 1800 seconds, formatted as requested:\n\n**Category**\nNews\n\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\n\nThe video segment begins with a discussion about Chris Ridgeway, a disgraced financial advisor, and his role in a global scheme that has devastated numerous investors. Ridgeway expresses regret for his actions, admitting to being arrogant and stupid. He claims to have believed he could fix the situation, having handled similar issues before.\n\nThe video then shifts to a discussion about how Ridgeway's actions were exposed. One of his furious clients, Jason Herman, informed Ridgeway's bosses at Shaw and Partners about the scheme. The company swiftly questioned Ridgeway and subsequently terminated his employment. Ridgeway denies any knowledge of his superiors being aware of his actions. He claims to have simply relayed information he was given to his clients, leading them to believe their investments were flourishing. He denies responsibility for not informing his compliance department, state manager, or CEO about the scheme.\n\nThe video then introduces Carolyn Ridgeway, Chris's wife and mother of his three children. Carolyn expresses her shock and devastation upon learning about her husband's actions, describing it as a nightmare and the worst thing that has ever happened to her. She reveals that Chris had been forging her signature on financial documents for years, a betrayal that compounded the pain of his involvement in the investment scheme. Carolyn learned about the scheme through a text message from Shaw and Partners informing her of Chris's dismissal. Her eldest daughter was deeply upset by the news, questioning her father's actions. Chris's response was dismissive, claiming that they didn't understand his business model. He then walked out on his family, leaving them financially devastated. Chris admits to feeling ashamed and wanting to hide, but ultimately, he was only concerned for himself, not his family's well-being.\n\nThe video then transitions to a discussion of the financial implications of the scheme. Ridgeway expresses remorse, but his actions left his family in a precarious financial situation. The video shows a photo of Chris and Carolyn celebrating with champagne, contrasting their past life with their current predicament. Carolyn reveals that Chris forged her signature on hundreds of documents, some related to companies she was listed as a sole director of, but had no knowledge of. Chris admits to forging her signature approximately 100 times, acknowledging the illegality of his actions but claiming he was too stupid to tell Carolyn about it.\n\nThe video then highlights media coverage of the scandal in The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, revealing a multi-million dollar scheme that spanned years. Stephen Helburg, a trained auditor with extensive experience, is introduced. He was approached by David Sutton and Andy Turner, the alleged masterminds of the scheme, to join their enterprise, Aus Streaming Investments. They sought his credibility to attract investors. Helburg initially believed the mining venture was legitimate, but after six months, he realized the assets reported on the balance sheet were non-existent. He contacted the external auditors, who confirmed that the valuations were not independent and did not comply with accounting standards. Helburg resigned in 2017 and involved his lawyers, as he was owed $250,000 in salary and millions of dollars in shares. He now believes he was involved in a highly questionable scheme with numerous victims.\n\nThe video concludes with a discussion of the ongoing nature of the scam and the need for regulatory intervention. The reporter reveals that 60 Minutes obtained a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which details how they were appointed as liquidators to locate Aus Streaming Limited's assets. After a year of searching and visiting vacant offices, they found no assets of value. The report also implicates David Sutton and Andy Turner as central figures in the scheme. The reporter emphasizes that ASIC needs to take further action, as the scam continues to this day. Chris Ridgeway acknowledges the possibility of facing fraud charges and potential jail time.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes\n* Shaw and Partners\n* The Sydney Morning Herald\n* The Age\n* Rio Tinto\n* Orica\n* Ernst & Young\n* Aus Streaming Investments\n* PricewaterhouseCoopers\n* ASIC (Australian Securities & Investments Commission)\n\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* City streets with Chris Ridgeway walking\n* Office meeting room with Chris Ridgeway and colleagues\n* Interview setting with Chris Ridgeway in a checkered shirt\n* Interview setting with Carolyn Ridgeway in a black top\n* Park bench with Carolyn Ridgeway\n* Photo of Chris and Carolyn Ridgeway celebrating\n* City street with Stephen Helburg walking\n* Interview setting with Stephen Helburg in a light blue shirt\n* Documents and financial statements\n* City street with pedestrians\n* Parking garage\n* Reporter in front of a city backdrop\n* Office building with a crane\n* ASIC office building\n\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Financial fraud and investment schemes\n* Betrayal and deception within a family\n* Regulatory failures and the need for greater oversight\n* The devastating impact of financial scams on victims\n\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Chris Ridgeway (disgraced financial advisor)\n* Carolyn Ridgeway (Chris's wife)\n* Jason Herman (client who exposed the scheme)\n* Stephen Helburg (auditor)\n* David Sutton (alleged mastermind)\n* Andy Turner (alleged mastermind)\n* Reporter\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like any other sections of the video described in detail!"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.25238422,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19314747},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19559398,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3007459},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.38260296,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.22000723},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07369652,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14608715}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1143,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178381}}}

He emphasizes the importance of targeted relief for low-income individuals facing high rents and interest rates, suggesting rent assistance as a viable option. He cautions against broad-based relief, arguing that it could exacerbate the situation.\n\nThe scene transitions to a woman named Shantel Schmidt, a freelance writer, who recently experienced a significant rent increase of $700 per fortnight.  She is shown using her laptop, presumably managing her finances or seeking information about her rights as a tenant. The visuals shift between close-ups of her face and hands on the laptop, conveying her concern and the practical steps she's taking to address the issue.\n\nThe narrator explains that Shantel and her housemates are planning to take their case to the tenancy tribunal. If they are unsuccessful, she might be forced to move out, becoming another victim of out-of-control inflation.\n\nThe scene changes to Shantel discussing the situation with a reporter in her kitchen. The reporter asks her about the concept of a \"fair go\" and whether she believes her situation aligns with it. Shantel acknowledges that everyone is feeling the pinch of inflation but expresses her belief that some people are taking advantage of the situation while others are struggling. She calls for greater empathy and fairness in dealing with the challenges posed by inflation.\n\nThe segment concludes with the show's host wrapping up the regular program and inviting viewers to engage with the show on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. He also promotes a documentary about cocaine crooks featured earlier in the program, available on 9Now.  Finally, he introduces a special report by Tara Brown about Kathleen Folbigg, a mother accused and convicted of killing her four babies. He highlights new scientific evidence that suggests a potential miscarriage of justice in her case.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes (news program logo)\n* 9Now (streaming service logo)\n* Facebook logo\n* Twitter logo\n* Instagram logo\n* TikTok logo\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Studio interview with an expert on inflation\n* Shantel Schmidt's apartment: living room and kitchen\n* 60 Minutes studio set with the host\n* Graphic displaying social media handles for 60 Minutes\n* Graphic promoting the Kathleen Folbigg special report\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Inflation and its impact on renters\n* Targeted vs. broad-based relief measures\n* Rent increases and affordability\n* Tenant rights and the tenancy tribunal\n* Fairness and empathy during economic hardship\n* Potential miscarriage of justice in the Kathleen Folbigg case\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Expert on inflation (unnamed)\n* Shantel Schmidt (freelance writer and renter)\n* Reporter interviewing Shantel Schmidt (unnamed)\n* 60 Minutes host (unnamed)\n* Tara Brown (reporter)\n* Kathleen Folbigg (subject of special report)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08756394,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.12852527},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.091382034,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.27048048},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1431879,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15610497},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08151978,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.08509916}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":632,"promptTokenCount":35638,"totalTokenCount":36270}}}

Here is a detailed description of the video from 600 seconds to 1200 seconds:\n\n**Category**\n\nNews\n\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\n\nThe news segment begins with a report on the death of Rolf Harris, a disgraced entertainer. The reporter mentions that Harris spent his final years as a recluse in his mansion in the UK. The reporter, Carrie-Anne Greenbank, is reporting live from outside Harris' home in Berkshire. She states that Harris' death may trigger an influx of civil cases against his estate, estimated to be worth up to $28 million. Harris' death was kept secret for almost two weeks. The cause of death was neck cancer. His family says he has already been laid to rest. The reporter concludes by saying that Harris' legacy will be that of a convicted pedophile who never apologized to his victims.\n\nThe next news story is about a house fire in Holsworthy, Australia. The fire started just two days into a couple's retirement road trip around Australia. Their daughter and her partner were home at the time and managed to escape the flames, which were sparked by an electric blanket. Rebecca Rego called out for her boyfriend, Alex, as they escaped the inferno. Neighbors tried to save the home using garden hoses, but their attempts were futile. The flames were six meters high. The owners, Rebecca's parents, had just retired and taken off on a road trip. They are now home to salvage what they can and rebuild what they've lost.\n\nThe following news story is about four police officers who were injured while trying to stop an allegedly stolen truck in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane. One of the officers was airlifted to the hospital in serious condition after the truck rammed into his patrol car. The driver has since been arrested.\n\nThe next news story is about Olympic boxer Harry Garside. His lawyers have told a court that there is video footage that shows his ex-partner, who has accused him of assault, as the aggressor. The 25-year-old was arrested as he touched down at Sydney Airport earlier this month and charged over an alleged physical altercation. He will front court again next month.\n\nThe next news story is about a racist comment made by former multiculturalism minister Mark Coure in state parliament. He apologized to the new member for Cabramatta, an MP of Vietnamese descent, who was uttering his first ever words in the chamber when the furore erupted. The member for Oatley made an offensive racist comment. Off-camera, Liberal MP Mark Coure had allegedly said of Mr. Vo, \"I thought he was from catering.\" It was a poor attempt at humor. The former multiculturalism minister has publicly apologized to Mr. Vo for the quip. Many MPs say jokes are often used to belittle new faces to parliament, but in a statement, the Cabramatta MP labeled the comment \"poor taste.\" It's not pleasant. It is offensive. As a parliament, we should do better. As the Minns government attempts to lift standards in parliament, it will need to rely on a spirit of cooperation, already the crossbench has used its balance of power to delay two of the premier's bills.\n\nThe next news story is about rental reforms that sparked fears of stoking an overheated market. If a prospective tenant offers more money to secure a lease, the legislation would force real estate agents to tell the other interested parties about their bid, potentially creating \"rental auctions.\" What we need to do is put an end to rent bidding because already we're seeing a brutally competitive market that is pricing people out. Now, with an inquiry looking into how to do that, renters will have to wait longer for change.\n\nThe final news story is about a dam search in Portugal for Madeleine McCann. Police have taken away evidence bags during the search. The latest hunt for answers over Madeleine McCann's disappearance. Nine's Europe correspondent Edward Godfrey is at the site in southern Portugal. Edward, activity has resumed there on day two. It has, Pete. There's lots of activity here at the Arade Dam, where police have just commenced their second day of searching. You might be able to see just behind us here, across the water, that's where police are focusing their efforts at the moment, just along the riverbanks there. Lots of vehicles going back and forth. There are tents set up in the scrubland, and officers have been going along the bank there, having a very close look at that area, focusing their energy there so far this morning. We know they left yesterday with several bags of evidence. Exactly what was in them is unknown. This is a big operation involving German, British, and Portuguese police, about 50 kilometers away from where Madeleine McCann vanished in 2007. German investigators... Okay, we've lost Edward there in southern Portugal, so we'll leave him there. And I've just been informed we have some breaking news we must go to on the tasering of 95-year-old Clare Nowland in a Cooma nursing home. Let's go live to Nine's crime editor, Emma Partridge. Emma, good evening to you. What can you tell us? Pete, just moments ago, I can confirm that the officer involved in the tasering of 95-year-old Clare Nowland, Senior Constable Kristian White, has just been charged with three offenses, including recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. That was confirmed just a few moments ago. And to repeat, Senior Constable Kristian White, a 33-year-old local from here in Cooma, has been charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in relation to the incident that occurred in the early hours of last Wednesday, where Clare Nowland, a great-grandmother, was tasered, a 95-year-old, after aged care staff called police to the hospital. Police have previously told us that police were called to the nursing home in Cooma and that Mrs. Nowland had a steak knife, a serrated steak knife, in her hand, one hand on a walking frame as she walked towards the door where Kristian White allegedly tasered her. Pete, we'll have more developments throughout the night, but we understand the Police Commissioner, Karen Webb, will be updating the media in a few moments time. All right, Emma Partridge reporting to us from Cooma. Thank you.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about Vivid Sydney, a light festival. 57 light installations, 300 events, and millions of visitors. Sydney's most spectacular light show, Vivid, is just a few days away. And this year, it's going to be bigger than ever, with live music, performances, and a dedicated program, Vivid Food. It's the time of year when show-stopping Sydney Harbour takes on a whole new life. The centerpiece is the iconic Opera House this year, lit up by the work of iconic artist John Olsen. \"Gotta be a lucky dog.\" A moving tribute in every sense. The 95-year-old died just six weeks ago. This, his final flourish, beaming over the harbor he loved. \"We were making plans about him having a hotel room just here and being able to, uh, open the balcony and, and watch the work with his family. Sadly, that wasn't to be.\" Vivid is Australia's largest festival, 12 locations including Barangaroo, Central Station and the Goods Line, Darling Harbour, the Royal Botanic Gardens, and Circular Quay, the headliner. A show stretching all the way to Taronga Zoo. \"It is very much like an Olympic environment.\" Each night patrolled by around 200 police. It is a big energy event at a time when Australian households are feeling the pinch. Organizers say the cost of Vivid is hard to quantify, but last year it brought $100...\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Nine News\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Berkshire, UK (outside Rolf Harris' home)\n* Holsworthy, Australia (house fire)\n* Toowoomba, Australia (police car crash)\n* Sydney Airport (Harry Garside arrest)\n* NSW Parliament (racist comment)\n* Sydney Harbour (Vivid Sydney)\n* Portugal (Madeleine McCann dam search)\n* Cooma (police station)\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Death of Rolf Harris and its potential legal ramifications\n* House fire in Holsworthy\n* Police officers injured in a car crash\n* Harry Garside assault allegations\n* Racist comment in NSW Parliament\n* Vivid Sydney light festival\n* Madeleine McCann dam search\n* Tasering of Clare Nowland\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Rolf Harris\n* Carrie-Anne Greenbank\n* Rebecca Rego\n* Alex (Rebecca's boyfriend)\n* Harry Garside\n* Mark Coure\n* Mr. Vo (MP for Cabramatta)\n* Member for Oatley\n* Liz Daniels\n* Edward Godfrey\n* Madeleine McCann\n* Emma Partridge\n* Clare Nowland\n* Kristian White\n* Karen Webb\n* John Olsen\n* Gill Minervini"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14128152,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1835935},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.25683168,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.33545995},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2407752,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19806427},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.16776322,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18952143}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1901,"promptTokenCount":177237,"totalTokenCount":179138}}}

The reporter discusses a breakthrough in gene therapy that offers hope to Australians living with rare genetic diseases. She mentions that there are currently no treatments for 95% of these conditions.\n\nThe scene transitions to a hospital room, where a medical professional in blue scrubs is preparing an IV bag. The reporter explains that this \"liquid gold\" could transform the life of a patient named Brett. Brett, sitting in a hospital bed, expresses his desire to live a healthy life for as long as possible.\n\nBack in the news studio, the anchor transitions to the next story about Vivid Sydney. He mentions that the event officially kicks off on Friday, but city-goers have been given a sneak peek with lights being tested at Circular Quay.

The anchor states that the date and location of the funeral will be revealed.\n\nThe segment then moves to a sports report. The anchors discuss the upcoming State of Origin rugby league match. They mention that Brad Fittler has taken a few gambles with the Blues' Origin team. The sports reporter then talks about Tevita Pangai Jr., a new face in the squad. Pangai Jr. reveals how he was called in to handle Queensland's \"bullies.\" Footage shows Pangai Jr. in a Blues uniform, giving an interview. He expresses his determination to stand up to Queensland's aggression.\n\nThe sports report continues with a story about Tom Trbojevic's return to the Origin arena.

Tayla is giving a speech. She says, \"To my husband. Yo, that's me! Thank you. We have both taken a risk to be here today in order to find love, and I am looking forward to starting this adventure with you. I am the kind of person who is loyal and gives my all to my loved ones.\"\n\nClaire, who is identified as a 31-year-old kindergarten assistant from Victoria, says, \"When I heard Tayla say the word loyalty, I felt really guilty and really shameful because I felt like I had not displayed loyalty to Jesse or to Janelle. I've acted dishonestly, and it made me feel really shit because it was a reminder of what I haven't been.\"\n\nHugo is giving his speech. Claire continues, \"I need to tell Jesse right now. I've held it in for too long. I don't think it's going to be a nice conversation, but it's a conversation that has to happen.\"\n\nClaire approaches Jesse at the table and whispers to him, \"Hey... Can I have just a quick word with you outside? Is that alright?\" Jesse replies, \"Yeah man. Now?\" Claire says, \"Yeah, we'll be right back.\" Claire and Jesse leave the table.\n\nAlyssa says, \"Shit.\" Claire and Jesse are sitting outside, talking. Claire says, \"So, there's been something that I've wanted to talk to you about for a little while. My heart's racing. I feel like it would be really unfair of me and wrong of me to call people out on their bad behavior or their mistakes when I have also not been perfect and I've acted outside of integrity.\"\n\nClaire continues, \"That night that we all went out, we kissed.\" Jesse looks surprised. Claire continues, \"I'm really, really sorry. I thought you're bringing me out here to call it off, to break up with me. I just knew like some something was so suss that and I had that feeling that part of me was just like, 'Have I got this wrong? Like, am I like a sensitive, jealous guy?' Well, and now I know I'm not. Like my suspicions were absolutely founded.\"\n\nJesse says, \"And Adam, bro, what a dog. Cannot wait to see him. 30 minutes chatting with a guy. Now, I don't know what type of kiss you had out the front, but I'm imagining it was more than we ever had in three weeks. And if you're just kiss this dude after what, maybe 30 minutes? That's flat so...\"\n\nClaire says, \"And I should have told you sooner. I'm sorry that I didn't. You don't deserve that.\" Jesse says, \"How how how... I couldn't have imagined anything worse than that and then you actually said something worse than that. I just put all my trust in him.\"\n\nJanelle is crying in a dark room. She says, \"I just feel numb.\"\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\nMarried at First Sight\nRed Arrow Studios\nEndemol Shine Australia\nNine Network Australia\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\nRooftop with city lights\nWedding reception\nAerial view of Sydney, NSW\nChandelier\nBridal table\nWedding reception of Tayla and Hugo\nHotel room\nHotel hallway\n\n**KeyThemes**\nRelationship issues\nInfidelity\nTrust\nGuilt\nShame\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\nHarrison\nBronte\nJesse\nClaire\nEvelyn\nRupert\nTahnee\nAlyssa\nAdam\nMelinda\nLayton\nTayla\nHugo\nJanelle"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.091382034,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.10818888},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.096705906,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13568978},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1778111,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19559398},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.34422323,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.42679968}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1370,"promptTokenCount":163668,"totalTokenCount":165038}}}

He is identified as Chris Ridgeway, a disgraced financial advisor. The video then cuts to a security camera footage of Ridgeway sitting at a conference table, looking bored and resting his head on his hand. The narrator states that Ridgeway is filled with regret about his role as a middleman in a global scheme that destroyed many investors.\n\nThe video then cuts to an interview with Ridgeway, who is now wearing a checkered shirt. He admits to being arrogant and stupid, and that he thought he could fix the problems he had created. The video then cuts to an interview with a man in a white t-shirt, who is identified as Jason Herman, one of Ridgeway's furious clients. Herman states that Ridgeway was integral to the scheme.\n\nThe video then cuts back to Ridgeway, who is now walking in a park, carrying his suit jacket. He is wearing a checkered shirt and tie. The narrator states that when Herman told Ridgeway's bosses at Shaw and Partners what their senior advisor had been up to, the company was quick to act. Ridgeway was questioned and then sacked.\n\nThe video then cuts to an interview with a woman in a red jacket, who is identified as the interviewer. She asks Ridgeway if anyone at Shaw knew what was going on. Ridgeway replies that no one knew. The interviewer then asks Ridgeway how he was able to dupe the compliance system for seven years. Ridgeway replies that he told the clients what he was told, so they felt as though their investment was continuing to be more and more prosperous. He adds that he didn't make the decision to tell his compliance department, state manager, or CEO.\n\nThe video then cuts to a woman sitting on a park bench. She is identified as Carolyn Ridgeway, Chris's wife and mother of his three children. The narrator states that the deception wasn't just directed at Ridgeway's clients. Carolyn Ridgeway is mortified by her husband's actions. She describes the situation as a nightmare, and the worst thing that has ever happened to her. She says that it has been done by the person she trusted most in the world, and that there are decades worth of lies and betrayal. She asks, \"For what?\"\n\nThe video then cuts to a wedding photo of Chris and Carolyn Ridgeway. The narrator states that they have been married for 35 years. Carolyn Ridgeway says that she learned the truth when Shaw and Partners sent her a text message saying they had sacked her husband. She says that they were completely blown away and blindsided.\n\nThe interviewer asks Carolyn Ridgeway what happened next. Carolyn Ridgeway says that her oldest daughter was very upset, and asked her what she had done. Carolyn Ridgeway says that they just got a text, and that she read some of it out to Chris. She says that Chris said that they didn't understand his business model, and then just turned and walked out.\n\nThe video then cuts back to Chris Ridgeway, who says that he was so ashamed that he wanted to hide and run away, and try to sort the matter out before coming back. He says that he was only thinking about himself, and not the well-being of his family and kids. He says that it has devastated his kids and his wife.\n\nThe video then cuts to a photo of Chris and Carolyn Ridgeway on a boat, toasting with champagne glasses. The narrator states that Ridgeway wants us to believe he is remorseful, but leaving his family high, dry, and penniless might also have had something to do with his fear that Carolyn would discover another betrayal.\n\nThe video then cuts to Carolyn Ridgeway, who is now sitting on a different park bench, petting a small black dog. The narrator states that for years, Ridgeway had been forging Carolyn's signature on financial documents. Carolyn Ridgeway says that there were hundreds of signatures that weren't hers, and that they went back to 2008. She says that the most shocking part of it all was that it had been 15 years of Chris signing things and using her name for things she was completely unaware of.\n\nThe interviewer asks Chris Ridgeway if he forged Carolyn's signature. Ridgeway replies that he did, probably a hundred times, on documents. The interviewer asks if he knew it was illegal. Ridgeway replies that he did. The interviewer asks why he did it anyway. Ridgeway replies that he was too stupid to tell Carolyn about it.\n\nThe video then cuts to a montage of newspaper headlines about the scandal. The narrator states that Ridgeway's sacking and subsequent media attention in the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age exposed a multi-million dollar scandal that has gone on for years, and continues to this day.\n\nThe video then cuts to a man in a light blue shirt writing on a whiteboard. He is identified as Stephen Helberg. The narrator states that Helberg has an impressive CV. He is a trained auditor with 40 years of experience, and has held senior roles at corporate giants including Rio Tinto, Orica, and Ernst & Young. In 2016, he was approached by the men Chris Ridgeway has named as the masterminds of the scheme, David Sutton and Andy Turner. They asked Stephen to join their enterprise. They wanted credibility.\n\nHelberg says that they needed the credibility in order to entice and convince investors to invest in these shell companies. He says that the total balance sheet that he could calculate was about $6.7 million Australian.\n\nThe video then cuts to Helberg walking down a city street. The narrator states that Helberg was hired to run a company called Aus Streaming Investments, a proposed mining venture that at first appeared good on paper. But he soon realized he too had been duped. The business had no cash, and he couldn't trace the assets that supposedly sat on its balance sheet.\n\nThe video then cuts to a document titled \"Background to the Investments.\" The narrator states that the notes to Aus Streaming's 2016 audited financial statements state that capital contributions totaling $138,534,413 were made to the company. The original shareholdings are listed.\n\nThe video then cuts to a letter titled \"2016 Audit - Communication with those charged with governance.\" The narrator states that the letter is from Nexia Australia, the external auditors of Aus Streaming Investments. The letter states that they are pleased to present their report on the audit of Aus Streaming Limited for the year ended 30 September 2016. They are responsible for communicating significant matters related to the audit that are, in their professional judgment, relevant to the responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process. This report includes an analysis of the audit outcomes, key audit risk areas, our conclusion, internal control deficiencies and other recommendations for your attention.\n\nThe video then cuts back to Helberg, who says that the asset value in the balance sheet was $138 million Australian at the time. He says that as he progressed, he realized about six months later that there was nothing to the assets that they had actually reported in the balance sheet. He started to unravel and untangle where the inter-holdings are, the cross-holdings. He contacted the external auditors the next year, and they confirmed that they relied on independent valuations that were provided by Andrew Turner. It turned out that those valuations were not independent, they did not comply with the accounting standards, and they were prepared by David Sutton.\n\nThe video then cuts back to the interviewer, who is now standing in front of a city skyline at night. She says that 60 Minutes has obtained this report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It reveals how they were appointed as a liquidator to find the assets of Aus Streaming Limited. But after a year of searching, trawling through records, and visiting offices that had been left vacant, it couldn't find that the company had anything of value. It did, however, establish that David Sutton and Andrew Turner were central to the scheme.\n\nThe video then cuts to a building with a crane on top. The narrator states that the authors of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report also called on the financial regulator ASIC to investigate suspicions that Aus Streaming may be involved in misleading and deceptive conduct.\n\nThe video then cuts to a screen showing the ASIC logo. The narrator states that Stephen Helberg says ASIC needs to do much more than that. The scam continues as we sit here today, and the regulator allows that to happen. They should at least stop it.\n\nThe video then cuts back to Chris Ridgeway, who is now sitting on a park bench. He says that he may end up being charged with fraud, and that he may end up going to jail over this.\n\nThe video then cuts to a graphic showing Ridgeway surrounded by burning stacks of Australian $100 bills. The words \"THE CONFESSION\" appear on the screen.\n\nThe video then cuts to a close-up of a clock face with the words \"60 MINUTES\" on it. The clock hands are moving.\n\nThe video then cuts to Ridgeway walking up a flight of stairs. He is wearing a suit and tie.\n\nThe video then cuts back to the interviewer, who is now standing in front of a city skyline at night. She says that in Australia, Chris Ridgeway signed up almost 100 unsuspecting investors. Needless to say, he is still waiting for the money.\n\nThe video then cuts to a man in a green hoodie walking through a parking lot. He is identified as Andy Turner.\n\nThe video then cuts to a man in a gray hoodie pushing a shopping cart down an escalator. He is identified as David Sutton.\n\nThe video then cuts back to Helberg, who says that looking back, he wishes he had never met Andrew Turner or David Sutton, or become involved with what he now believes is a highly questionable scheme with many victims. He says that it is probably the most sophisticated share scheme that he has seen in his life.\n\nThe interviewer asks Helberg how many investors he thinks there are. Helberg replies that he suspects 2,000 plus people have been scammed into this, maybe more. The interviewer asks if it is a get-rich-quick scheme, a Ponzi scheme, or a scam. Helberg replies that it is not a Ponzi scheme. If it were a Ponzi scheme, at least somebody along the way would have been paid. Nobody gets their money back. So, it was well-planned, well-executed, and orchestrated in multiple jurisdictions, with legal entities. It takes money, time, and know-how to actually do all of that. So, he thinks it is a well-planned, sophisticated, global scheme to defraud investors.\n\nThe video then cuts back to the interviewer, who is now standing in front of a city skyline at night. She says that 60 Minutes has obtained this report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It reveals how they were appointed as a liquidator to find the assets of Aus Streaming Limited.

The title card features the number nine in blue with nine smaller blue circles to the left of the nine. The word \"NEWS\" is below the nine in blue, and the word \"SYDNEY\" is below \"NEWS\" in a smaller font. The background is white with blue and red accents.\n\nThe news intro begins with a breaking news story about a shooting in Liverpool. The footage shows police cars and crime scene tape at the scene of the shooting. A burnt-out car is also shown. The intro then transitions to a story about the police commissioner being under pressure after the tasering of a 95-year-old grandmother. The footage shows the police commissioner, Karen Webb, being interviewed. The intro then transitions to a story about an Australian man who died on Mount Everest. The footage shows the man, Jason Kennison, climbing the mountain. The intro then transitions to a story about a police officer who was found guilty of assaulting a 16-year-old boy. The footage shows the police officer being interviewed. The intro then transitions to a story about Sydney's train network failing passengers. The footage shows trains and buses at various stations. The intro then transitions to a story about Brad Fittler's origin gamble. The footage shows Fittler being interviewed.\n\nThe news anchor, Peter Overton, then begins the news bulletin. He reports that a man in his 20s has been shot dead in Elizabeth Hills. Police were called to the scene just after 4 p.m. Firefighters were also called to deal with two burnt-out cars in nearby Bonnyrigg Heights and Green Valley. The news anchor then crosses to a reporter on the scene.\n\nThe reporter, Bianca Balzer, reports that the victim is aged in his 20s but has yet to be formally identified. Liverpool police were called to the scene at around 4 p.m. When they arrived, they found the man sitting in his car with multiple gunshot wounds, including to his head. He could not be saved. The back window of the car has been shattered. Police are now swarming the street. The crime scene tape is up, and there are cars and officers everywhere. It's a very raw scene at the moment. Someone has just run in, perhaps a relative, perhaps someone who knew the victim. Detectives will no doubt be working through the night to work out exactly who has done this and why. They are also interested in two other crime scenes not far from here, with cars found burnt out in Green Valley and Bonnyrigg Heights just minutes after the first call to officers. Police have yet to confirm whether these incidents are all linked, but it does appear that there may be some connection.\n\nThe news anchor then returns to the studio. He reports that the state police commissioner was in damage control today, fronting cameras and a mountain of questions over the tasering of a 95-year-old woman. Karen Webb defended her decision not to watch the bodycam footage or check in on the officer involved.\n\nThe news report then shows footage of the police commissioner being interviewed. She says that she can understand the community's concern and outrage about what's been reported. She says that it's hard to believe. The interviewer asks her how she thinks she's handled the situation. She says that she can understand the community's concern and outrage, and that it's hard to believe. The interviewer then asks her if she had any doubt, and she says that it was all captured on police body camera. The interviewer then asks her why she didn't mention the word \"taser\" in the first police media release, and she says that they didn't even know what the circumstances were. The police commissioner says that it took 36 hours to establish how the taser was used. The interviewer asks her if she's spoken to the officer involved, and she says no, not yet. The interviewer asks her if she thinks she needs to reach out to him to say he's okay, and she says she will in appropriate time. The family of Clare Nowland have maintained their silence and a bedside vigil at Cooma Hospital. The police commissioner says she's bracing herself for backlash.\n\nThe news report then shows footage of Jason Kennison, an Australian man who died on Mount Everest. He was told he might never walk again, but he fought his way back from paraplegia to climb Mount Everest. The 40-year-old Australian man took on the world's tallest peak for charity but sadly died during the descent. He is remembered for his tenacity and resilience. Jason Kennison was no stranger to a challenge, be it tackling Mount Everest or learning to walk again after a traumatic car crash. To get to where he is now, he said, looking back, it took a lot of his confidence, his self-esteem. Each injury he had affected him and made him a bit more insecure. He suffered a broken leg and shoulders, and worst of all, spinal cord damage after a routine operation. After months of rehab, he returned to work in the mines, but he wanted to give back and raise money for spinal cord patients. And so, with a ladder in his backyard, he trained to take on Everest. He said the training he put in place and the great team behind him helped him achieve his goal. Jason and his team successfully reached the summit on Friday. He made it in high spirits, doing what he wanted. His brother said the climb up was great, he had his photo on top of the summit. But on the way down, his team ran out of oxygen, and Jason struggled. He had reached a ledge called The Balcony, just 450 meters below the peak, an area known to climbers as the death zone, and it's where Jason died. His mother said he was an amazing son, amazing brother, amazing uncle. He was just on top of the world, literally on top of the world, and that's what he wanted to achieve, and he achieved that. The man who was told he'd be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life achieved what most can only dream about.\n\nThe news report then shows footage of a police officer who was found guilty of assaulting a 16-year-old boy at Surrey Hills. The footage shows the police officer forcefully arresting the teenager. The magistrate said the description of violent resistance is not corroborated by the video. He simply does not see what the defendant says occurred. The police officer said the teenager cracked him across the face. The magistrate asked if it was acceptable to say those things to the teenager. The magistrate also asked if the police officer still believed he used reasonable force. The police officer is yet to be sentenced, but it's unlikely he'll again serve the public as an officer on Sydney streets.\n\nThe news report then shows footage of a bus crash in West Ryde. Traffic was at a crawl around West Ryde this afternoon after a bus and car collided on Victoria Road just after 3 o'clock. The bus mounted a curb and crashed into an electrical pole. All six lanes shut as emergency teams worked to remove live power lines. The bus driver was taken to hospital with injuries to his back.\n\nThe news report then shows footage of a stabbing in Burwood. One man remained in hospital, and another is under arrest after a stabbing at Burwood last night. The 61-year-old victim was treated by paramedics for wounds to the stomach before being taken to Westmead Hospital in a serious condition.

A man next to her, wearing a light-colored jacket, listens attentively, nodding occasionally.\n\nThe camera then shifts to a different group, seated on a green couch. A man with short, dark hair and a beard is talking to a woman with long, blonde hair and bright pink eyeshadow. The woman holds a wine glass in her hand. The man gestures with his hands as he speaks, and the woman listens intently.\n\nThe conversation seems to be about someone named Dan. The woman on the couch expresses surprise and disbelief, asking, \"Would he do that? Like, is that his vibe?\"\n\nThe scene cuts back to the dinner table, where the woman in the blue dress continues her conversation with the man in the light jacket. They are both smiling and laughing.\n\nThe camera then focuses on a man in a beige shirt and jeans, who is standing at the table, addressing the group. He seems to be trying to calm the situation, suggesting that they \"drop it\" and let the issue resolve itself.\n\nThe scene shifts to a different angle, showing the group on the couch. A man in a beige shirt is standing in front of them, talking to them. He appears to be mediating the conversation. The group on the couch listens intently, their facial expressions showing concern and curiosity.\n\nThe scene cuts to a group of three people sitting at a table in a different room. They are watching the events unfold on a television screen.

The man in the beige shirt says, \"So there's nothing more to the story.\"\n\nThe scene cuts to the man with short, dark hair and the woman in the blue dress sitting at the dinner table.

The man initiates the conversation by addressing a couple, Josh and Melissa. He asks Josh why he wouldn't want to stay with Melissa, given that she's a nice, great person. The other couples in the room listen attentively as the conversation unfolds.\n\nA woman with blonde hair and a black dress defends Josh, emphasizing his kind nature and questioning why Melissa wouldn't want to stay with him. She suggests that Melissa's words towards Josh might be perceived as implying he's not \"enough of a man\" for her.\n\nThe man in the suit picks up on this point, highlighting the emotionally charged words Melissa has used towards Josh. He observes that Josh appears deeply affected by the situation. The camera focuses on Josh, who is visibly upset, his eyes welling up with tears.\n\nThe man in the suit then addresses Josh directly, expressing his understanding of Josh's emotional state. He acknowledges that the situation is difficult and that he's never seen a relationship like this before in the experiment. He then makes an unprecedented decision, deviating from the usual protocol of the experiment. He tells Josh that he's offering him an option he's never offered before, as he believes there's no coming back for Josh in this experiment. The man in the suit explains that he doesn't want to subject Josh to this situation any longer.\n\nHe reminds Josh of the experiment's rule: if one person writes \"stay\" and the other writes \"leave,\" the couple remains in the experiment for another week to see if they can resolve their issues. He then reveals that Melissa wrote \"stay.\" However, he tells Josh that the final decision rests with him.\n\nJosh, with tears in his eyes, expresses his desire to leave. Melissa, looking somber, accepts his decision. The man in the suit respects Josh's request and wishes both of them well. Josh and Melissa then leave the room, returning to the larger group of couples.\n\nThe scene shifts to the three facilitators of the experiment, seated on a brown leather couch. They introduce the next couple, Alyssa and Duncan. Alyssa and Duncan settle onto a green velvet couch, and the facilitators inquire about their week. Alyssa and Duncan respond positively, describing their week as \"very good\" and mentioning an \"intimacy week.\" Alyssa playfully hides her face behind a clipboard, laughing.\n\nThe facilitators then ask about their relationship's progress, and Alyssa shares that the week has brought them even closer. She expresses her appreciation for a workshop led by Alessandra, which encouraged open communication about sex. Alyssa credits this workshop with helping them improve their relationship.\n\nThe facilitators then shift the focus to another couple, Lyndall and Cam. Lyndall and Cam sit on a green velvet couch, and the facilitators note that they appear comfortable together. However, they point out that Lyndall and Cam didn't seem as close and connected the previous night. Lyndall explains that over the weekend, Lyndall saw Shannon with another person, presumably Shannon's ex and their daughter. Cam had reacted by saying he wouldn't get involved in the situation. Lyndall expresses her desire for Cam's support in such situations, but she felt she received a dismissive response from him.\n\nCam acknowledges Lyndall's feelings and apologizes if his response came across negatively. He explains that he didn't want to create conflict in their relationship. The facilitators offer advice, suggesting that Cam find a way to support Lyndall while respecting his own boundaries. They emphasize that this is a learning process and that there will be challenges along the way.\n\nThe facilitators then ask Lyndall and Cam for their decision. Cam reveals that he wrote \"stay,\" and Lyndall, after a moment of playful suspense, also reveals that she wrote \"stay.\" The facilitators congratulate them and wish them a good week. Lyndall and Cam return to the larger group.\n\nThe facilitators then call up the final couple, Caitlin and Shannon. Caitlin and Shannon sit on a green velvet couch, and the facilitators acknowledge the difficult week they've had. Caitlin recounts a conversation with Shannon where he made hurtful comments about her appearance and expressed a lack of attraction. She shares that Shannon also mentioned that if someone he found attractive had walked down the aisle, he would have ended his relationship with his ex. Caitlin expresses her hurt and explains that she requested a separate room because she couldn't bear to sleep in the same bed as someone who felt that way about her.\n\nThe facilitators address Shannon, questioning his motivation for making such hurtful remarks. Shannon appears defensive and struggles to provide a clear answer. The facilitators emphasize the importance of treating each other with respect, even during difficult conversations. They acknowledge that Shannon is in his first relationship and that there will be learning curves along the way. They encourage him to persevere and work on his communication skills.\n\nFinally, the facilitators ask Caitlin and Shannon for their decision. Shannon reveals that he wrote \"stay,\" and Caitlin, after a moment of hesitation, also reveals that she wrote \"stay.\" The facilitators wish them a good week, and Caitlin and Shannon rejoin the group.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\nNone\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Dimly lit room with couches and candles, where the couples' discussions take place.\n* Brown leather couch where the three facilitators sit.\n* Green velvet couches where the couples sit during their individual discussions.\n* Larger room with multiple couches and a coffee table, where all the couples gather.\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Relationship challenges and communication issues.\n* Emotional vulnerability and expressing feelings.\n* Importance of respect and support in relationships.\n* Learning and growth in relationships.\n* The impact of past relationships on current ones.\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Josh\n* Melissa\n* Alyssa\n* Duncan\n* Lyndall\n* Cam\n* Shannon\n* Caitlin\n* Alessandra (mentioned)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07055965,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.105210766},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07055965,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.10230474},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08035743,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13477601},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.299925,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3090236}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1249,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178487}}}

The poster also features the title \"WHO'S HUGH?\" and credits Serge Negus as the producer. The woman speaks about Hugh Sheridan, an actor who dared to \"act,\" taking on the role of a lifetime. However, this decision offended a minority group who then \"brutally canceled\" him.\n\nThe scene transitions to a darkened theater where a man, presumably Hugh Sheridan, stands on stage. The lights come on, illuminating a brick backdrop. The scene shifts again, showing Sheridan from behind as he stands on a larger stage with bright spotlights. The camera then focuses on his face as he looks upwards, seemingly in awe.\n\nThe scene changes to show Sheridan in a light brown shirt, standing on the same stage. He speaks about his passion for entertaining people, expressing that it's all he's ever wanted to do since he was little.\n\nA montage of clips follows, showing Sheridan in various roles and settings: singing in a music video, wearing a suit and smiling for the camera, talking to a woman in a kitchen while tossing a tennis ball, changing clothes in a bathroom, and talking to a blonde woman in a living room.\n\nThe scene transitions to an awards ceremony where Sheridan, dressed in a tuxedo, accepts an award. He thanks his mother and acknowledges the immediate adulation he received. More clips follow, showcasing Sheridan's fame: receiving another award, wearing sunglasses in a desert setting, and acting in a scene with bloodstains on his shirt.\n\nSheridan, now in a navy suit, discusses his experience at drama school and the unexpected turn his life took after landing a job. He expresses gratitude for his success but admits to struggling with the public attention.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the woman in red, who introduces the topic of acting as a ruthless and competitive profession. She mentions that Sheridan made it look easy for over a decade, but three years ago, everything changed.\n\nThe scene transitions to a poster featuring Sheridan in heavy makeup, with the title \"HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH.\" The woman explains that Sheridan landed the lead role in the Australian production of this Broadway hit. He thought it would be the role of a lifetime, but it almost ended his life.\n\nSheridan, back in the navy suit, explains that he took the job without realizing he was offending anyone. He expresses regret and apologizes for what happened. The scene cuts to a clip of Sheridan performing in drag, singing into a microphone. The woman narrates the story of Hedwig, a character who undergoes a sex change.\n\nSheridan discusses the challenges of the role, including the physical demands and the emotional complexity of embodying a conflicted character. The woman asks if he's transphobic, to which he vehemently denies, expressing offense at the accusation. He mentions receiving messages accusing him of taking a trans role and expresses shock at the allegations. He clarifies that he had no idea he was causing offense.\n\nThe scene shifts to a smartphone displaying a petition demanding Sheridan's removal from the play. The woman explains that social media went wild with threats, and thousands signed the petition. Sheridan was devastated, receiving messages accusing him of transphobia. He reveals that he attempted suicide twice.\n\nSheridan's sister, Zoe, appears alongside him in a theater setting. She expresses her anger and hurt at the targeted attacks on her brother. Sheridan admits to feeling shocked and saddened by the events, emphasizing that he didn't want to put his family through such pain. He reflects on how the experience made him feel, describing it as a \"dark\" time.\n\nThe woman in red asks if he felt let down by the Australian production for not standing by him. Sheridan expresses regret and a sense of learning from the experience. He suggests that it was one of the early big cancelations in the country.\n\nThe scene changes to Sheridan walking with a blonde woman in a hallway lined with theater posters. He points out some of his past roles. The woman comments on the quick shift from being loved to being loathed, which crushed Sheridan. He and his sister discuss the impact of the events, including his suicide attempts.\n\nThe scene transitions to a montage of newspaper headlines about Sheridan's personal life, sexuality, and identity.

The narrator mentions that the inspectors they spoke to disagree with the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) about the workload, stating that it is unmanageable and that the VBA simply doesn't care.\n\nThe scene then shifts to an interview with a woman who is discussing the pressure that building inspectors face to meet targets. She says that there are consequences for not meeting targets and that inspectors are being pressured not to do their jobs properly.\n\nThe video then shows a recording of a building inspector, Rob Carcutt, talking about his work. He says that he is motivated by making sure that the buildings he inspects are properly constructed. However, when he defended his work to his managers, he was ignored. He says that he felt like he was being pressured to cut corners and that he feared he would be managed out of a job.\n\nThe video then shows Rob's correspondence with the VBA. He documented every single detail of his work to protect himself, believing he was a target. He feared he would be managed out of a job. He was trying to fight to do his job, and for him not to be able to do what he was employed to do was heartbreaking. His wife told him to leave, but he said that there were a lot of people relying on him and that he couldn't let go.\n\nThe video then shows a recording of Rob talking about his workload. He says that he went to seven jobs yesterday and that he thinks the expectations are becoming unrealistic.\n\nThe video then shows Rob's wife and a reporter looking at Rob's correspondence with the VBA. The reporter says that Rob was a member of the union and that he told them of his struggles in many emails. The union was so concerned that it informed the VBA managers, raising their fears that someone would end up taking their own life. Tragically, the union was right.\n\nRob's wife says that she was devastated by his death and that she believes the VBA caused his death. She says that she had so much anger because it was only work to her, but to him, it was important.\n\nThe video then shows a man walking down a dark street. The narrator says that Rob's story is not unique and that 60 Minutes has spoken with five former and current VBA inspectors who are too scared to speak publicly, except for one man.\n\nThe man says that the culture of the VBA is toxic and that there is an enormous amount of stress on inspectors to put KPIs on inspections. He says that one permit might be for 30 duplex units and another permit might be for a small two-bedroom unit, but it's still only one inspection. He says that he doesn't think it's in some people's DNA to do that.\n\nThe video then shows the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. The narrator says that inspectors were sent here to inspect the plumbing on medical gases, but an investigation found that they weren't even qualified to do the job. The man says that people of this organization don't have the same moral fiber or social conscience that he has.\n\nThe video then shows Premier Daniel Andrews speaking to reporters. He says that he is now aware of the toxic culture at the VBA. The inspectors claim that the government knew about the toxic culture for some time but failed to act. The Premier says that there was a tragedy at the VBA not long ago and that it exposed some very significant cultural issues there.\n\nThe video then shows the reporter asking the Premier whether his government was alerted to the fact that there were serious workplace problems within the VBA in February 2022. The Premier says that he certainly wasn't. The reporter then asks whether the government knew about the workplace problems that were within the VBA and what action they took before that workplace tragedy. The Premier says that he certainly didn't.\n\nThe video then shows the reporter walking on a beach with Rob's wife. The reporter asks her what she thinks Rob would want to be done. Rob's wife says that he would definitely want them to be held accountable. She says that she is still concerned about people's safety there and that she will keep fighting.\n\nThe video then shows a photo of Rob and his wife. The reporter says that hopefully, the Premier will have more luck getting answers out of the VBA than they did. She says that the VBA refused their request for an interview, but that there are multiple investigations underway looking into their practices.\n\nThe video ends with the reporter saying goodnight and reminding viewers to have their say about the show on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.

The segment starts with footage of lions lying on the grass and on a rock. Then, the scene transitions to a caged area where zoo staff members are preparing a lion for a medical examination. The lion is placed on a table, and staff members hold its mouth open while another person cleans its teeth. The news anchor explains that even lions, the kings of the jungle, must undergo regular medical checkups.\n\nThe segment then cuts to an interview with Judy Wilson, a carnivore keeper at the Sydney Zoo. She explains that in the wild, lions must hide any pain or weakness they experience, as showing vulnerability can be detrimental to their survival. The news anchor adds that for the triplet brother lions at the Sydney Zoo, the medical checkup involves an anesthetic dart and an appointment at a temporary lion medical center set up in their biggest den.\n\nThe segment shows footage of the lions being examined by zoo staff. One lion is given an anesthetic dart in its rear end, and another lion has its mouth held open for a dental checkup. The news anchor explains that the lions are given heart and lung support during the procedure and are kept warm with heaters.\n\nThe segment then cuts to an interview with Dr. Kresen Pillay, a veterinarian at the Sydney Zoo. He explains that the medical team moved 600 kilograms of equipment to the lions' den to perform the checkups.

He adds that Skoda Kodiaqs have dropped by about the same amount, Hyundai Palisades are down nearly 20%, Nissan X-Trails are down 16%, and a three-year-old Volkswagen Tiguan has lost 13% of its value. He mentions that Mitsubishi Outlanders have fallen 12%. He then notes that Toyotas exist in a world of their own, as a three-year-old Kluger has actually made money.

The lead investigator, Detective Superintendent Scott Moller of the Australian Federal Police, tells the inquiry that he raised concerns with the ACT's Director of Public Prosecutions about the credibility of the complainant, Miss Higgins, and a perceived lack of evidence. However, Shane Drumgold, the Director of Public Prosecutions, stuck to his view that police should charge Bruce Lehrmann, who maintains his innocence. Superintendent Moller rejects suggestions that the outcome of the trial was personally disappointing. He says it's offensive to suggest that he was disappointed because he wasn't. He concedes that the relationship between investigators and Mr. Drumgold broke down. Another point of tension, according to Superintendent Moller, was the involvement of the ACT Victims of Crime Commissioner, Heidi Yates, in the case. Ms. Yates was by Miss Higgins' side throughout the trial, acting as a go-between with police. Mark Tedeschi AM KC, counsel for Shane Drumgold SC, tells the inquiry that Mr. Drumgold and the investigating team were frustrated that Ms. Yates had placed herself as an intermediary. Superintendent Moller thought a commissioner, head of an agency, working as a support person was inappropriate. The inquiry continues.\n\nThe next news segment is about a Russian attack. An anti-Kremlin militia has raided a Russian border town. The group of Russian nationals claims to be an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin. They also shared video of the so-called flag of Free Russia flying over parts of Moscow.\n\nThe next news segment is about a security scare. A truck has crashed through a security barrier at Lafayette Park, right in front of White House gates. Inside, officers found a flag with a Nazi symbol. The driver has been arrested and is facing charges including threatening to kill, kidnap, or inflict harm on a president or family member and assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe next news segment is about a riot in Cardiff. Furious crowds have rioted following a crash in the area that killed two teenagers. Up to 150 young people gathered, some wearing balaclavas, breaking up bits of pavement to hurl at officers and setting cars on fire.\n\nThe next news segment is about a flower show. A favorite event of the Queen's has been marked by the new monarch, King Charles, visiting the Chelsea Flower Show. But it was another royal stealing the spotlight, the Princess of Wales, charming at a children's picnic. Dressed in pink, the Princess of Wales made a surprise visit on the first day of the Chelsea Flower Show, taking a seat on a picnic blanket and casually chatting to school children as they enjoyed their lunch. The Princess revealed her youngest, Louis, is already showing signs of becoming a green thumb. Kate then joined the kids as they explored the gardens on the grounds of London's Royal Hospital, while facing some tough questions from her young admirers. Today's visit was a family affair. Her in-laws, King Charles and Queen Camilla, also taking in the brightly colored and creative designs. Charles, a keen gardener himself, there for the first time since losing his mother, Queen Elizabeth. The late monarch was patron of the Royal Horticultural Society for 70 years and a regular visitor at the flower show throughout her reign. This year marks 110 years of the world-famous horticultural show, with close to 170,000 expected to attend the gardens over the next five days.\n\nThe next news segment is about a smash and grab. Two bandits in Brisbane dressed up in the perfect disguise when they robbed a family-owned jewelry store. Head-to-toe black burqas making them almost impossible to identify. The owner, Abdul Azzam, was threatened with a gun as the thieves smashed open display cases and stole jewelry worth an estimated $200,000.\n\nThe next news segment is about a hotel fire. A 20-year-old man has been charged with arson after a hotel was destroyed by fire at Yass in the Southern Tablelands. The 117-year-old commercial hotel was undergoing renovations when it was set alight yesterday morning. The flames so strong, it took firefighters six hours to put it out.\n\nThe next news segment is about a new way to protect crops from mice. Mice might be sneaky, persistent little devils, but fortunately, we humans are smarter. Australian scientists have come up with a clever way to beat the mouse plagues that have devastated so many farms across the country. Two years ago, this wheat and canola farm southwest of Wagga was teeming with mice. The plague that ravaged eastern states costing grain growers $1 billion in New South Wales alone was devastating Peter Rayner's crops. As livelihoods were eaten away, Sydney University scientists carried out a world-first trial on Peter's wheat crop, warding off the rodents by manipulating their minds. Mice find their food through smell, sniffing and digging out seeds sown around two centimeters below the ground. By spraying the crop with an oil derived from wheat germ, scientists found they could camouflage the scent of the seeds. The results were startling, reducing the damage to crops by up to 74%. A similar treatment could be used on other crops, reducing the need for toxic pesticides. And with the oil made from a byproduct of the milling process, it's a safer and cheaper way to protect our precious food bowl.\n\nThe next news segment is about an explosion in lower back pain cases. An explosion in lower back pain cases over the next three decades could lead to a healthcare crisis, with Australia expected to see a 50% increase by 2050. The major report led by Sydney researchers found that the condition is more common among older people rather than working-age adults, and cases are higher among women compared to men. Low back pain is the leading cause of disability in the world.\n\nThe next news segment is about a major search for Madeleine McCann. A big development in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. A major search is underway tonight at a dam in Portugal, not far from where the toddler went missing. The search was requested by German investigators who claim their prime suspect visited the area often. 16 years after her disappearance, a new search in Portugal's Algarve region. Portuguese and German police establishing a major operation at a reservoir, 50 kilometers from where Madeleine McCann went missing. The development in one of the world's most infamous missing person's cases driven by German investigators. They've previously named Christian Brueckner as their sole suspect. A man investigators claim frequented the reservoir and is currently in jail for raping a woman in Praia da Luz, where the British toddler vanished in 2007. UK detectives have traveled to Portugal to watch over the two-day search. The most significant operation in this case in nearly a decade. British police leading the last major search like this in 2014. Unofficial searches of the Barragem do Arade reservoir in 2008 uncovered nothing. This formal operation will focus on a two-kilometer stretch of water and woodland. A search for answers for Madeleine's parents, who this month marked what would have been her 20th birthday, saying they'll never give up. Brueckner has denied any involvement in McCann's disappearance and hasn't been charged.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n- Nine News\n- Chery\n- The North Face\n- ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal\n- Australian Federal Police\n- U-Haul\n- Wales News Service\n- The Sun\n- ITV News\n- RHS\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n- ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal\n- Lafayette Park, Washington, D.C.\n- Cardiff\n- Chelsea Flower Show\n- Wagga Wagga, New South Wales\n- Arade Dam, Portugal\n- New Scotland Yard\n\n**KeyThemes**\n- Criminal justice system\n- Russian attack\n- Security scare\n- Riot\n- Flower show\n- Missing person\n- Back pain\n- Mouse plague\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n- Eliza Edwards\n- Scott Moller\n- Shane Drumgold\n- Bruce Lehrmann\n- Brittany Higgins\n- Heidi Yates\n- Mark Tedeschi\n- Vladimir Putin\n- Kate Middleton\n- King Charles\n- Queen Camilla\n- Queen Elizabeth\n- Abdul Azzam\n- Peter Rayner\n- Peter Banks\n- Finn Parker\n- Sophie Walsh\n- Madeleine McCann\n- Christian Brueckner\n- Edward Godfrey\n- Jim Gamble"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20055786,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18713295},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.33545995,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.40403762},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.3293916,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.24508521},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20307489,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.21601154}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1837,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":179075}}}

The narrative centers on Giancarlo Granda, a young man who claims to have had a sexual relationship with Becki Falwell, with Jerry Falwell Jr.'s alleged involvement.\n\nThe segment begins with Giancarlo Granda recounting the crumbling of his life and professional reputation following the revelation of the affair. He describes texting Becki Falwell, anticipating his own demise, and requesting the return of his dog to his family. He expresses a desire to distance himself from the Falwells.\n\nThe narrative shifts to the perspective of the interviewer, who summarizes the Falwells' stance, suggesting they portrayed Giancarlo Granda as an extortionist who fabricated the story. However, the interviewer highlights that Giancarlo Granda possessed evidence: a recorded FaceTime call from Becki Falwell, boasting about their sexual encounters, with Jerry Falwell Jr. present in the background.\n\nGiancarlo Granda then details the content of the FaceTime call, describing Becki Falwell walking around her house naked, pointing to locations where they had sex, including a kitchen island and one of her children's bedrooms. He confirms having had sex with Becki Falwell in her master bedroom and one of her children's bedrooms, asserting that the FaceTime recording serves as undeniable proof.\n\nThe segment transitions to news coverage of Jerry Falwell Jr.'s resignation from Liberty University amid the scandal. The news reports refer to an \"inappropriate personal relationship.\"\n\nThe scene then cuts to Mark Ebner, a New York Times bestselling author who has written a book about the scandal. He comments on the Falwells' perceived untouchability and their belief in their own power. He recounts a conversation with Jerry Falwell Jr. during which Giancarlo Granda's potential political aspirations were discussed, and Jerry Falwell Jr. advised Giancarlo Granda that it's better to be a kingmaker than a king, recognizing the limits of his own power.\n\nThe segment returns to the interviewer, who reveals that Jerry Falwell Jr. initially denied any involvement in the sexual relationship during a phone call. However, Becki Falwell later contacted the interviewer, demanding to share her side of the story.\n\nIn a recorded phone conversation, Becki Falwell initially declines a FaceTime call, stating she's in bed. She then proceeds to discuss Christianity, emphasizing that everyone makes mistakes and sins, and that Jesus Christ died on the cross to forgive sinners. She questions why she is held to a different standard because her husband was a university president.\n\nMark Ebner then comments on Becki Falwell's statement, pointing out the lack of remorse and the Falwells' apparent belief in their own righteousness. He suggests their attitude implies they believe they can \"burn in hell\" without consequence.\n\nThe segment concludes with Giancarlo Granda reflecting on the ordeal, acknowledging the dark times and regret but also expressing personal growth and pride in exposing corruption and predatory behavior. He believes his younger self would be proud of him.\n\nThe program ends with the host, Tom Steinfort, summarizing the segment and inviting viewers to share their opinions on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. He also directs viewers to Nine Now for additional content and extra segments.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes (television program)\n* Nine Network (television network)\n* Nine Now (streaming service)\n* Facebook (social media platform)\n* Twitter (social media platform)\n* Instagram (social media platform)\n* TikTok (social media platform)\n* Best Buy (electronics retailer)\n* Ross Dress for Less (clothing retailer)\n* T-Mobile (telecommunications company)\n* Fontainebleau (hotel)\n* Venum (sports equipment brand)\n* NBC News (news organization)\n* CBS Evening News (news program)\n* Washington Examiner (newspaper)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Interview setting with Giancarlo Granda\n* Street scene in Miami\n* Fontainebleau hotel entrance\n* Close-up of a phone showing a FaceTime call with Becki Falwell\n* Close-up of a phone showing a FaceTime recording\n* News footage of Jerry Falwell Jr. and Liberty University\n* Interview setting with Mark Ebner\n* Poolside scene with Mark Ebner reading a book\n* Close-up of a phone showing a FaceTime call with Jerry Falwell Jr.\n* Close-up of a phone showing a voice message from Becki Falwell\n* Boxing gym scene with Giancarlo Granda training\n* Photo of Giancarlo Granda and Becki Falwell\n* 60 Minutes studio with Tom Steinfort\n* 60 Minutes social media and streaming platform graphics\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Sex scandal\n* Hypocrisy\n* Power and corruption\n* Redemption and personal growth\n* Religious hypocrisy\n* Media manipulation\n* Consequences of actions\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Giancarlo Granda\n* Becki Falwell\n* Jerry Falwell Jr.\n* Mark Ebner\n* Tom Steinfort\n* Donald Trump (mentioned in the context of considering Jerry Falwell Jr. for a position)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.17106095,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17217167},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.18126312,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.25832576},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.37937865,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.34598845},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.42679968,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.38306442}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1131,"promptTokenCount":833613,"totalTokenCount":834744}}}

Craig Foster, a former soccer player and advocate for the Australian Republic Movement, expresses his belief that the leader of Australia should be an Australian citizen. He emphasizes the importance of having an Australian face as the face of the country, reflecting the diversity and inclusivity of modern Australia.\n\nThe video then revisits the 1999 Australian republic referendum, which sought to determine whether Australia should become a republic and choose its own head of state. Footage from the referendum shows people voting and expressing their opinions on the matter. The \"no\" campaign ultimately won, with 54.9% of the vote. Republicans argued that the majority of Australians wanted to ditch the monarchy but couldn't agree on the best model for electing a president.\n\nCraig Foster reiterates his desire for another referendum in the next five years and expresses confidence that it will succeed this time. He emphasizes the need for Australia to be governed by Australians and not foreign overlords. He also highlights the importance of Australia standing on its own and being represented by its own people.\n\nThe conversation shifts to the question of whether enough people care about the issue of Australia's head of state, given the pressing economic challenges facing the country. Foster acknowledges the validity of the question and suggests asking First Nations leaders and multicultural communities about the significance of colonization and representation. He emphasizes the importance of standing for something, both domestically and internationally.\n\nThe video then features an interview with Charles Brandreth, a long-standing friend of the Royal Family. Brandreth expresses his love for the Crown and suggests that sometimes it's a case of \"better the devil you know.\" He acknowledges that if Australia chose to become a republic, the King would still want to retain close ties between the two countries.\n\nThe segment concludes with a preview of the next story, \"Hammer Blow,\" which investigates the crisis in the Victorian construction industry and the failure of the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) to protect consumers from dodgy construction companies and tradespeople. The preview highlights the devastating impact of shoddy workmanship on homeowners and the need for greater accountability in the industry.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Honda\n* AON Risk\n* Sovereign\n* Valvoline\n* Oka\n* Vladivar\n* Mary\n* Nike\n* Australian Republic Movement\n* 2UE\n* 2GB\n* Astra Gilbert\n* Milla Apartments\n* Century 21\n* Victorian Building Authority (VBA)\n* Porter Davis Homes\n* Dulux Professional\n* Good Sheds\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Soccer field with advertising banners\n* Interview with Craig Foster\n* Parliament House with projected images of Queen Elizabeth II\n* Interview with Charles Brandreth\n* Footage from the 1999 Australian republic referendum\n* Coastal scene with a monument\n* Interview with Charles Brandreth and Tom Steinfort\n* King Charles III and Queen Camilla holding koalas\n* Charles Brandreth and Tom Steinfort walking on a street in London\n* Charles Street sign in London\n* Children singing with Australian flags\n* King Charles III exiting a car and greeting people\n* Construction site with damaged wood\n* Victorian Building Authority (VBA) building\n* Aerial view of Melbourne city\n* Interview with a woman about construction issues\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Australian Republic Movement\n* 1999 Australian republic referendum\n* Debate about Australia's head of state\n* Importance of representation and inclusivity\n* Crisis in the Victorian construction industry\n* Failure of the Victorian Building Authority (VBA)\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Craig Foster\n* Queen Elizabeth II\n* King Charles III\n* Queen Camilla\n* Charles Brandreth\n* Tom Steinfort\n* Christina Hearn\n* Phil Dwyer\n* Anne"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.15405777,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.21469133},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.11436871,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.25982565},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21337745,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20817901},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09807943,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.120025486}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":839,"promptTokenCount":822993,"totalTokenCount":823832}}}

A boat sails across the water in the foreground. The narrator mentions that Sydney is one of the most picturesque harbors in the world.\n\nThe scene transitions to a shot of the Sydney Harbour Bridge with the sun shining brightly behind it. A boat sails in the foreground.\n\nThe camera then focuses on the hands of a person steering a boat, navigating through the harbor. The view from the boat's window shows the Sydney cityscape and the Opera House.\n\nA man in a dark uniform with the words \"Australian Border Force\" embroidered on it appears. He is identified as Superintendent Graeme Campbell. The camera zooms in on the side of the boat, revealing the words \"Australian Border Force\" printed on it. An Australian Border Force flag flies on the boat.\n\nSuperintendent Campbell is interviewed on the boat by a man in a light-colored shirt. The interviewer asks Campbell about the threat posed by the cruise ship industry in Australia. Campbell replies that it is a very real threat for the importation of narcotics. He clarifies that while the majority of passengers and crew are legitimate travelers, a small element tries to use the industry to import narcotics. He adds that Australia is a big island with a big coastline, making it an attractive target for organized crime. The interviewer asks if it's hard to police, and Campbell says it is very hard, but they are pretty good at it.\n\nThe boat speeds through the water, leaving a trail of white foam. Superintendent Campbell looks out from the boat.\n\nThe scene shifts to a montage of photos of two women, Isabelle Lagace and Melina Roberge.\n\nThe video then shows Isabelle interacting with a parrot, holding it on her hand and then kissing it.\n\nA scene of llamas and a woman in traditional clothing appears, followed by a shot of a stone building with a bell tower.\n\nSuperintendent Campbell is interviewed in a dark room. He says that certain ports in South America are associated with the production and distribution of cocaine, and the Sea Princess visited some of those ports. He adds that this escalates the risk because it gives passengers access to organized crime entities based in high-risk countries, providing them access to narcotics. The interviewer asks at what point along the journey they had eyes directly on the passengers. Campbell replies that they were monitoring their movements along the way.\n\nThe video shows a cruise ship from above, focusing on the side of the ship with rows of balconies and an orange lifeboat. The scene then transitions to a forested area with a river flowing through it, followed by an aerial view of a city at night.\n\nIsabelle Lagace is interviewed in a room with a bed and plants. She says that the plan was to bring cocaine from Peru to Sydney on the cruise ship. She adds that she wasn't really thinking about the consequences.\n\nThe video shows scenes of the Sea Princess, including the deck with a pool, a grand staircase, and a woman sitting on a bench that says \"Sea Princess.\" A man relaxes on a deck chair.\n\nThe interviewer asks a couple about what happened when they got to Peru. The man replies that, like every port, they went shopping. The video shows photos of the couple visiting ruins and taking pictures.\n\nThe interviewer says that they didn't see much of Isabelle or Melina in Peru. The woman in the couple says that on their day trips, Isabelle and Melina were never on the bus with them, and there was nothing to indicate they were up to mischief.\n\nThe video shows social media posts from Isabelle and Melina. One post shows Isabelle in a restaurant, while another shows Melina on a boat.\n\nSomeone opens a suitcase revealing packages wrapped in plastic and tape.\n\nThe video shows a mountainous landscape with snow-capped peaks. Isabelle says that they were aware that Peru was the destination for the drugs, but they were not going to be in their cabin yet. She says they continued the trip, enjoying the streets of Peru.\n\nThe video shows scenes of drinks being poured and people dancing in a club. Isabelle says they had way too much to drink, and she remembers doing a lot of Snapchat stories, laughing, and living their best life.\n\nThe video shows a schematic of the Sea Princess with a suitcase icon moving to a cabin and the words \"SUITCASE PLANTED\" appearing.\n\nA person places a bag on a conveyor belt at an airport security checkpoint. X-ray images of luggage appear on the screen.\n\nThe couple is seen walking away from a cruise ship. The man says that he can't fathom how anyone could think they could smuggle something on board a vessel. He says that in his wildest dreams, he would never smuggle anything. The woman agrees. The man jokes that he might smuggle a bottle of wine.\n\nThe video shows social media posts of Isabelle and Melina.\n\nSomeone opens a suitcase to reveal packages of cocaine.\n\nThe video shows a mountain range at sunset. Isabelle says that they were aware that Peru was the destination for the drugs, but they were not going to be in their cabin yet. She says they just continued the trip and enjoyed the streets of Peru. She says they had way too much to drink, and she remembers doing a lot of Snapchat stories, laughing, and living their best life.\n\nThe video shows scenes of a beach with palm trees and overwater bungalows, a woman snorkeling, and a woman dancing on a beach. Isabelle says that Tahiti and Papeete were the most beautiful destinations. She says she really wanted to get a tattoo there, and she ended up getting a hand tattoo. She says the artist was amazing, and it's the only thing she doesn't regret about the trip.\n\nThe Sea Princess arrives in Sydney. The video shows the ship docking and passengers disembarking.\n\nSuperintendent Campbell says that most passengers consider entering Sydney Harbour one of the highlights of their cruise. He says they are generally in the observation areas or on the open deck areas where they can look at Sydney Harbour. He says it was highly likely that the two women would be in those areas, but there was no guarantee. He says the boarding team engaged with the security team on board, identified where the women were, and radioed that information to the boarding teams. He says they went to those locations, spoke to the individuals concerned, and said they would like to conduct an examination of their cabin and ask them to accompany the officers back to their cabins.\n\nThe video shows an aerial view of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Isabelle says that on the morning they arrived in Sydney, people were starting to disembark the ship. She went upstairs to the buffet to eat breakfast, and that's when the border force entered the restaurant. She says she knew it was over. She says they were almost the only ones in the restaurant, so she knew it was for her.\n\nIsabelle says that they asked her to follow them to the cabin, and there were people with dogs. The dogs sat next to the luggage. They asked if it was her bed, and she said yes. They asked if it was her luggage, and she said yes. She didn't know the combination, so they cut it open to find about 30 kilograms of cocaine in her luggage.\n\nSuperintendent Campbell says that the drugs weren't really hidden.\n\nThe interviewer asks what the reaction from the girls was at the time. Campbell says they were both very surprised.\n\nThe couple is sitting in a cafe. The woman says that she looked up and thought there was a dog. Then she looked and saw a heavily uniformed man attached to the dog. There were a few of them. She thought maybe this was normal at the end of a cruise. Then she watched them walk past and go down the corridor. Her friends were in the same corridor as the girls. Her friend came up and said, \"Oh my god, they got the girls on the floor. There's police and dogs.\" When she saw that, she wondered what was going on. The man says it answered a lot of questions.\n\nThe video shows a cabin on the cruise ship. Isabelle says that they asked her to follow them to the cabin, and there were people with dogs. The dogs sat next to the luggage. They asked if it was her bed, and she said yes. They asked if it was her luggage, and she said yes. She didn't know the combination, so they cut it open to find about 30 kilograms of cocaine in her luggage.\n\nSuperintendent Campbell says that it was obvious the drugs weren't really hidden.

She says they were almost the only ones in the restaurant, so she knew it was for her.\n\nIsabelle is seen walking along a lake shore and then in a grassy yard.\n\nSomeone places handcuffs on a person's wrists.\n\nThe video shows a montage of photos of Isabelle and Melina.\n\nA couple is sitting on a bench near the water with the Harbour Bridge in the background. The woman says that she looked up and thought there was a dog. Then she looked and saw a heavily uniformed man attached to the dog. There were a few of them. She thought maybe this was normal at the end of a cruise. Then she watched them walk past and go down the corridor. Her friends were in the same corridor as the girls.

The number 60 is in red, and the word “MINUTES” is written below it in red. The stopwatch is black and has a silver rim.\n\nThe scene transitions to Tara Brown, the news anchor, sitting on a stool in front of a screen. The screen displays the title of the news segment, “THE CONFESSION,” along with the producer's name, Naomi Shivaraman. Behind the title, there is an image of a man with a somber expression, surrounded by stacks of money that appear to be on fire.\n\nTara Brown welcomes the audience to 60 Minutes and introduces the segment, “The Confession.” She explains that it is a joint investigation with The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, exposing a dubious global financial scheme that is currently active. Hundreds of Australian families and thousands worldwide are caught in the scheme, with many victims unaware of their missing life savings. The total losses could amount to millions of dollars.\n\nThe anchor reveals that a key player in the scheme has decided to confess. The scene shifts to a black Porsche Macan with the license plate “RIDGYS” parked in a wooded area. A man, identified as Chris Ridgeway, gets into the car, starts it, and drives away. An aerial shot shows the car driving along a winding road through a forested area.\n\nThe voiceover states that the Porsche is meant to project an image of success, but Chris Ridgeway’s spoils are ill-gotten. He is described as a con man. The scene cuts to Ridgeway sitting in a chair, adjusting his hair and asking about his makeup. He is wearing a blue and white checked shirt.\n\nThe voiceover continues, stating that Ridgeway is about to do something unusual: confess. A woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a red blazer, appears on screen. She asks Ridgeway, “Do you think you’re a crook?”\n\nRidgeway hesitates and responds, “I don’t want to think of myself as a crook, but some of my actions in recent times have been terribly unlawful. I’m ashamed, and I’m sorry.” He expresses his lack of self-respect and self-worth, saying he struggles to look at himself in the mirror.\n\nThe scene changes to Ridgeway walking down a staircase, then exiting a building. The voiceover explains that for years, Ridgeway was employed at Shaw and Partners, a reputable financial brokerage. He was a respected and trusted senior advisor, which facilitated his scheme to defraud his clients and friends.\n\nThe scene transitions to an aerial shot of a city at night, with illuminated skyscrapers. The words “Shaw and Investments,” “Shaw and Growth,” “Shaw and Innovation,” “Shaw and Opportunity,” and “Shaw and Trust” appear on the screen, followed by “Shaw and You,” and finally, “Shaw and Partners.”\n\nRidgeway is shown walking down a city street, then looking up at the tall buildings. The voiceover states that he now wants to be seen as a con man with a conscience. He has agreed to expose the global financial scheme that is still operating. He promises to reveal his role in the scheme, how his clients were affected, and how many were left destitute.\n\nA man with short, spiky hair, wearing a navy blue polo shirt, is shown speaking. He says, “It’s catastrophic. It affects what you can do, what you can’t do, the time you spend with your family.”\n\nA woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a red patterned top, adds, “In terms of our overall life, yeah, massive impact.”\n\nA woman with long blonde hair, wearing a black top, simply says, “Yeah.”\n\nA man with thinning hair, wearing a patterned shirt, states, “And it’s lost me my trust of the financial system.”\n\nThe blonde woman in red asks, “How big do you think it is?”\n\nRidgeway, now wearing a light gray suit and a red and white striped tie, responds, “How big it is? We’re looking at about five and a half billion dollars US. That’s not a small amount of money.”\n\nThe blonde woman with shoulder-length hair, now wearing a black blazer and a white shirt, appears on screen and says, “As you’ll see, people all around the world have been lured into the scheme, and it’s not only the loss of their savings that hurts, but also the embarrassment they feel because the truth was so simple.”\n\nRidgeway is shown walking away from the camera in a city setting, then looking up at the buildings. He says, “I haven’t done too much to make me a trustworthy person, but I’m here today because my life is at rock bottom. I’m trying, I’m trying to tell people I’m sorry. I’m trying to be honest with myself.”\n\nThe blonde woman in the black blazer adds, “To prove his remorse, Chris Ridgeway has agreed to expose a global financial scheme that’s still operating right now. He’s promised to tell the truth about his role in it, how his clients were impacted, and how many of them were left destitute.”\n\nThe man in the navy blue polo shirt reiterates, “It’s catastrophic. It affects what you can do, what you can’t do, the time you spend with your family.”\n\nThe woman in red adds, “In terms of our overall life, yeah, massive impact.”\n\nThe woman in black repeats, “Yeah.”\n\nThe man in the patterned shirt states, “And it’s lost me my trust of the financial system.”\n\nThe blonde woman in red asks, “How big do you think it is?”\n\nRidgeway, in the gray suit, replies, “How big it is?

That’s not a small amount of money.”\n\nThe blonde woman in black states, “As you’ll see, people all around the world have been lured into the scheme, and it’s not only the loss of their savings that hurts, but also the embarrassment they feel because the truth was so simple.”\n\nRidgeway is shown walking down a city street, then looking up at the buildings. The voiceover explains that Ridgeway wants to name names. He claims that the masterminds of the dubious investment scheme are Andy Turner, based in Britain, and David Sutton, from Australia.\n\nBlack and white images of Turner and Sutton are displayed. Turner is a bald man with glasses, wearing a light-colored shirt. Sutton has white hair and is wearing a striped shirt and a light-colored jacket.\n\nA car drives down a rainy street, and Sutton is seen walking across the street. He is carrying a bag.\n\nTurner is shown sitting in a chair, talking to a man in an orange jacket. Behind them is a green Aston Martin Vantage. Turner is wearing a dark green sweatshirt.\n\nSutton is shown on an escalator with a shopping cart full of groceries, then walking through a parking garage.\n\nRidgeway, back in the interview setting, says, “Those two people are the ones that we need to find out where the money’s gone from. They tried desperately to avoid phone calls and any contact with shareholders or anybody else.”\n\nAn aerial shot shows Ridgeway’s Porsche driving along a winding road through a forested area. The voiceover explains that Ridgeway claims his role was as a middleman. He signed up investors for Turner and Sutton’s scheme and was rewarded with lucrative secret kickbacks. By falsely claiming that his employer, Shaw and Partners, endorsed the deals, his unsuspecting clients readily signed up.\n\nThe camera pans up the side of a tall building with the name “ONE ONE ONE” displayed on it. Ridgeway, in the interview, admits, “I know that now, but I didn’t think that was the case when I started.”\n\nThe blonde woman in red asks, “Do you honestly think they’re a con now?”\n\nRidgeway replies, “Yeah, I’m pretty sure they’re a con now.”\n\nThe scene shifts to Ridgeway looking at a stock ticker display, then turning to face the camera. The voiceover states that Ridgeway isn’t going down quietly. He wants to name names and expose the masterminds of the scheme.\n\nA montage of photos shows Ridgeway in various locations, including driving a car, posing with a group of people in front of a Christmas tree, standing in front of the Colosseum in Rome, walking in the snow, on a boat in Venice, skiing with a group of people, riding in a Land Rover in a desert, posing with a red Ferrari California T, on a boat, and dining at a restaurant.\n\nThe voiceover explains that it’s illegal for financial advisors to take secret commissions, but Ridgeway did it anyway. He spent the $1.6 million in kickbacks on luxury cars and lavish overseas holidays. His clients were unaware that their savings were funding his extravagant lifestyle.\n\nA woman with short white hair, wearing a light green top, is interviewed. She says, “So he never said he was getting a commission.”\n\nThe blonde woman in red asks, “Did you anticipate that you would be couriering at this time?”\n\nThe woman in green replies, “No. No, that was never divulged. It’s not just your standard commission. It’s a massive commission that’s been found that he was pocketing. Yeah, I guess you get paid well to do dodgy stuff.”\n\nThe scene changes to a woman getting into a black Mazda CX-30, starting it, and driving away. The voiceover explains that unlike Ridgeway’s Porsche, this car isn’t for showing off. The woman, identified as Leith Reynolds, needs it for work. She is supposed to be retired, but thanks to her once-trusted financial advisor, she needs to work.\n\nRidgeway, now wearing a checked shirt, is shown in the interview setting. He says, “I knew it was wrong. They said we’ll pay you a decent commission, and I guess I was, I was greedy, and I was desperate for money, and I made a decision to, you know, let them sway me. I figured, well, bugger it, you know, I’m going to do something for myself, and it was the wrong decision to make.”\n\nA montage of photos shows Ridgeway in various locations, similar to the previous montage. The voiceover explains that it’s illegal for financial advisors to take secret commissions, but Ridgeway did it anyway. He took $1.6 million in kickbacks and spent it on luxury cars and lavish overseas holidays. His clients had no idea their savings were funding his extravagant lifestyle.\n\nLeith Reynolds is shown again, walking down a city street. The voiceover explains that in 2016, in the Brisbane offices of Shaw and Partners, Ridgeway proposed a plan to improve Leith’s financial security. He told her about a stock that was about to list on an overseas exchange, promising a fortune if she invested early.\n\nLeith Reynolds is shown again, now wearing a red dress, standing with her back to the camera and looking up at tall buildings. She explains, “It wasn’t like we’d met at a hotel somewhere over a beer and he said, ‘Hey, I’ve got a good deal here.’ No, I was in the office of a huge national company, a respected company. He was a senior advisor. If you can’t trust a senior advisor in a national company to help you with your finances, who can you? And clearly, I needed help.”\n\nLeith Reynolds is shown in her kitchen, making coffee. The voiceover explains that money was tight, but Leith handed over the last $20,000 from her late husband’s life insurance.\n\nLeith Reynolds is shown again, standing with her back to the camera and looking up at tall buildings. The voiceover states that this wasn’t enough for Ridgeway.\n\nLeith Reynolds, back in the interview setting, explains, “He rang me and said, ‘You sure you haven’t got any more money? This is just such a good deal.’ He told me he’d invested his whole inheritance in it, and he convinced me to transfer, I think about $20,000, out of my super fund as well, which wasn’t full of money, being a stay-at-home mum, had very, mostly had, wasn’t exactly flush with money.”\n\nThe blonde woman in red asks, “But he plundered it?”\n\nLeith Reynolds replies, “Yeah, yeah.”\n\nLeith Reynolds is shown in her kitchen again, making coffee. The voiceover explains that for a while, Leith believed her investment was a winner.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes (news program)\n* The Sydney Morning Herald (newspaper)\n* The Age (newspaper)\n* Porsche (car brand)\n* Gucci (fashion brand)\n* Shaw and Partners (financial brokerage)\n* Aston Martin (car brand)\n* Superdry (clothing brand)\n* Mazda (car brand)\n* Nespresso (coffee machine brand)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Studio set with news anchor\n* Wooded area with parked Porsche\n* Interview room\n* City street with tall buildings\n* Shaw and Partners office building\n* Rainy street\n* Car dealership with Aston Martin\n* Escalator and parking garage\n* Leith Reynolds’ kitchen\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Financial fraud\n* Betrayal of trust\n* Confession and remorse\n* Consequences of greed\n* Impact on victims\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Tara Brown (news anchor)\n* Naomi Shivaraman (producer)\n* Chris Ridgeway (con man)\n* Adele Ferguson (reporter)\n* Andy Turner (alleged mastermind)\n* David Sutton (alleged mastermind)\n* Leith Reynolds (victim)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20561528,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17217167},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.22678408,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.33545995},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2643585,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.23091994},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09947014,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16344576}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":2963,"promptTokenCount":177234,"totalTokenCount":180197}}}

He receives a text message with a still image from a video of him in a hotel room. He says he did not consent to being recorded and felt vulnerable. He felt like it was a subtle threat.\n\nThe video cuts to a man speaking at a podium with a Liberty University logo. He introduces Donald J. Trump. Trump walks onto the stage and receives an honorary degree.\n\nThe video then shows a man in a suit standing in a garden. The narrator explains that the Falwells paid $8 million to buy the Alton Hotel in Miami and offered Giancarlo Granda a 24% share in the property in return for him managing it. Giancarlo Granda says Jerry Falwell Jr. offered him the opportunity to make his first million. He says when you’re 20 years old, how could you say no to that? He says if you have wealthy investors who are willing to invest in you and give you equity stake in a property in South Beach, you have to take it.\n\nThe video shows a montage of photos of Trump, Jerry Falwell Jr., and Giancarlo Granda. The narrator explains that Giancarlo Granda was suddenly hanging out with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, a close friend of the Falwells. Giancarlo Granda describes meeting Trump. Jerry Falwell Jr. pointed him out to Trump and said he was his friend from the Fontainebleau. Trump said he loved the Fontainebleau. They shook hands, and Trump signed Giancarlo Granda’s book. Trump told him to work hard. Giancarlo Granda says it was a pretty cool moment. The interviewer asks him if in the back of his head he was thinking, “How did I end up here?” Giancarlo Granda says yes, he was thinking that. He says he went with the flow. The interviewer asks him if he had a little bit of Stockholm syndrome. He asks why he kept it going for so long. Giancarlo Granda says the interviewer is not the first person to mention Stockholm syndrome. He says there was a part of him that felt obligated or like he had to stick with them. He says they were doing so much for him that even if he felt uncomfortable, he had to bite the bullet and keep going.\n\nThe video cuts to Michael Cohen walking out of a courthouse surrounded by reporters and photographers. The narrator explains that with the arrival of Donald Trump’s then-fixer and lawyer, turned prison inmate, Michael Cohen, sexually compromising photos of Becky fell into the wrong hands. Michael Cohen helped the Falwells get them back. But then, sometime later, Cohen asked for a favor in return. He wanted Jerry Falwell Jr. to become the first prominent religious leader to publicly endorse Donald Trump’s presidential nomination.\n\nThe video shows a news clip of Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsing Trump. The narrator explains that many students at Liberty University, like Dustin Wiles, couldn’t believe that their supposedly Christian college was promoting this man to be president. Dustin Wiles says Donald Trump infamously said that he grabbed a woman by the… The interviewer finishes the sentence for him. Dustin Wiles says yes, and Trump said so many things about other minority groups as well. The interviewer asks if there were eyebrows raised that this was the kind of man that an evangelical church wanted to endorse as the president. Dustin Wiles says there were some eyebrows raised, but not enough. He says Falwell Jr. stood by Trump’s side all throughout that and said there was nothing Trump could say that would keep him from getting Falwell Jr.’s support. The interviewer asks Dustin Wiles if Donald Trump aligned with Christian values in his mind. Dustin Wiles says there’s nothing about Donald Trump or Trumpism that is reflected in Christianity.\n\nThe video shows a clip of Trump walking onto a stage with his family. The narrator explains that history shows Donald Trump went on to win the election, in part due to huge support from the religious right.\n\nThe video cuts to Michael Cohen walking out of a courthouse surrounded by police officers. The narrator explains that the secret of Michael Cohen’s involvement and the Falwells’ nude photos remained undisclosed for years until, in 2019, the story got even weirder with the intervention of Hollywood actor Tom Arnold.\n\nThe interviewer asks Tom Arnold how a Hollywood star like him ended up involved in a story like this. Tom Arnold says it started with Donald Trump, as all the horrible stories start. The video shows a clip of Tom Arnold in the sitcom _Roseanne_. The narrator explains that Tom Arnold became a household name in the 90s as an actor and comedian, most notably on the sitcom _Roseanne_. But in recent years, he’s reinvented himself as an online sleuth, digging for dirt on Donald Trump. The video shows Tom Arnold leading a protest with signs that say “Free the Footage,” “Love Trumps Fascism,” and “Release the Tapes.” The narrator explains that as part of that, he recorded conversations with Michael Cohen, who opened up to him in 2019 about the Falwell photographs that teen Trump had acquired during the campaign. The video shows a montage of screenshots of Tom Arnold’s conversation with Michael Cohen. Tom Arnold says there’s a bunch of photographs, personal photographs that somehow the guy ended up getting. Whether it was off Jerry’s phone or somehow maybe it got airdropped or whatever the hell the whole thing was. Even though she’s a very nice figure, nobody wants that. They’re private photos. Tom Arnold says Michael Cohen went to him and said, “Hey, Jerry, the naked pictures of your wife, etc. Well, I still got one of the pictures, and I need you to do me a favor for my boss. It’ll really make me look good if you support him, support Donald Trump.” Tom Arnold says that’s the reason it was payback for the naked pictures. The interviewer asks Tom Arnold if he ever saw them himself. Tom Arnold says yes, the picture was very, very, very, very intimate post-lovemaking picture. He says that’s all he can say on the network.\n\nThe video shows Tom Arnold driving a car. The narrator explains that critically, at the time, Tom Arnold also became aware the Falwells had struck an unusual business deal with a young man they met at a hotel in Miami by the name of Giancarlo Granda. Giancarlo Granda was trying to move on with his life by then, but the Falwells had locked him into this business arrangement, and Becky continued to hit on him. The video shows Giancarlo Granda standing in front of a building. He says when he first met Donald Trump in 2012, he liked him and admired him. But obviously, that changed around 2016 with his comments about Mexicans. He says he’s half-Mexican; his mom is from Mexico. So immediately, he was turned off by him. He says he doesn’t think Trump should be the representative of the United States. He doesn’t think Trump should have the nuclear codes. The interviewer says “dark” is almost a kind way of describing it. He says Giancarlo Granda was in a bad place. Giancarlo Granda says yes, he was definitely in a bad place. He says he felt like he was used.\n\nThe video cuts to Jerry Falwell Jr. and Becky Falwell sitting on a stage. The narrator explains that the Falwells thought they could keep Giancarlo Granda silent. But little did they know, he had a smoking gun that was about to expose their hypocrisy to the world. The video shows a screenshot of a video call between Giancarlo Granda and Becky Falwell. The interviewer asks if Giancarlo Granda brought down a dynasty. Tom Arnold says he’d like to think so.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\nApple, 60 Minutes, Liberty University\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\nHotel room, podium with Liberty University logo, garden, Alton Hotel in Miami, courthouse, Oval Office, Liberty University, streets of Los Angeles, boxing ring, dock\n\n**KeyThemes**\nBlackmail, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, religious hypocrisy, sexual misconduct\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\nGiancarlo Granda, Donald Trump, Jerry Falwell Jr., Becky Falwell, Michael Cohen, Dustin Wiles, Tom Arnold"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.25683168,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.23231025},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.271252,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.4082763},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.49536136,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.41347742},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.39934343,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.26588073}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1775,"promptTokenCount":833613,"totalTokenCount":835388}}}

He welcomes viewers to 60 Minutes and London, introducing himself. He notes the unusual circumstance of a 74-year-old taking on a new job, referring to King Charles III's recent coronation. The title card for the segment, \"The King and Us,\" appears on screen, featuring an image of King Charles in his coronation robes.\n\nSteinfort highlights the challenge facing King Charles in filling his mother's shoes, particularly given the polling data suggesting Queen Elizabeth was more popular than Charles, as well as other members of the royal family like Prince William, Princess Anne, and even his grandchildren. He mentions the republican sentiment in Australia, where calls for independence are being renewed.\n\nThe video then shows footage of King Charles and Queen Camilla on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, waving to the cheering crowds. The narrator describes the moment as historic, emphasizing the weight of expectation on the new monarchs. The scene shifts to a young boy with a crown on his head, taking a picture of the royal couple with his phone.\n\nThe video cuts to a crowd of people waving flags and cheering, with some wearing King Charles masks. The narrator comments on the scaled-back flyover due to weather conditions, and Prince Louis's enthusiastic waving. The crowd is described as huge, even exceeding what the late Queen would have been proud of.\n\nThe video then cuts to an interview with Valentine Low, royal correspondent for The Times newspaper. Low describes the coronation ceremony as a huge outpouring of love and support for Charles, expressing his belief that Charles will be a better king than people expect. He recalls being inside Westminster Abbey and witnessing every moment of the coronation up close. He describes the experience as \"pretty fantastic,\" highlighting the music and the king's robes.\n\nThe video returns to footage of the coronation ceremony, showing the procession of the crown and other regalia.

A gospel choir is shown performing.\n\nThe video then focuses on Prince William, the new heir to the throne, and his family. Prince William is shown pledging allegiance to his father, King Charles, sealing it with a kiss. Low describes the moment as iconic and heartfelt, noting the genuine fondness between father and son.\n\nThe video then shows archival footage of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, contrasting her younger age with King Charles's age of 74. It highlights Prince Louis's yawns and waves, which became a talking point for royal watchers.\n\nThe video then cuts to Prince Harry arriving at the coronation alone, without his wife Meghan Markle and their children. Low comments on Harry's quick departure after the service, driving straight to the airport in a black BMW. He notes the sadness of the situation, highlighting the fractured relationship between Harry and his father and brother. He expresses doubt about any reconciliation in the near future.\n\nThe video concludes with a segment about Madeleine Easton, a violinist from Sydney who had the honor of performing at the coronation. She describes the experience as \"unbelievable,\" emphasizing the historical significance of the event. The video shows her playing the violin, and the narrator mentions her membership in the Baroque Soloists and Monteverdi Choir, of which King Charles is a patron and fan.\n\n\n"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.046033874,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.12506537},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.046033874,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.12678547},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09268759,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1550786},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06656918,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13206623}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":828,"promptTokenCount":177234,"totalTokenCount":178062}}}

The camera zooms in on a young woman with braces, holding two medals. She expresses her hope to one day go to the Olympics and represent Australia. Cut to a woman swimming in a pool, then back to the young woman, now older, talking about her swimming career. She mentions feeling \"jets out of her arms\" and breaking world records.\n\nThe scene transitions to a close-up of a stopwatch, with the words \"60 MINUTES\" displayed. The announcer introduces the program and mentions Ariarne Titmus, an Olympic and world champion swimmer. He highlights her determination and zest for life as key factors in her success.\n\nThe scene shifts to a hospital room, where a newborn baby is being attended to by medical staff. The baby is shown struggling to breathe. The announcer states that Ariarne's first minutes in the world were perilous, close to being her last.\n\nCut to Ariarne, now an adult, watching a video of her birth on a laptop. She expresses her emotions upon seeing the footage and mentions how it made her feel. Her parents, Robin and Steve, are also interviewed, recalling the fear they felt during her birth. Steve is shown filming the event, hoping for a miracle. The video then shows the baby finally crying, bringing relief to her parents.\n\nThe scene transitions back to Ariarne, who talks about her fighting spirit and how she had it from birth. She credits this spirit for her success in swimming. The announcer then mentions how Ariarne's determination helped her overcome challenges and achieve Olympic glory.\n\nThe video shows Ariarne winning two gold medals and celebrating with her coach. She then reflects on her childhood dream of becoming an Olympian and how it came true.\n\nThe scene shifts to Ariarne's hometown in Tasmania. She talks about the challenges of growing up in a small town and how it helped her stay grounded. She mentions the lack of champions in Tasmania and how she had to leave her home to pursue her dream.\n\nThe video shows Ariarne walking with her parents and sister through a field, reminiscing about the decision to leave Tasmania.

They question whether Evelyn knows what it's like to be with someone like Rupert, as she has previously dated players. The experts believe Rupert's openness and honesty can offer Evelyn a new and different experience.\n\nThe scene transitions to the morning of the final two weddings. Taylor, one of the brides, expresses her anxiety about marrying a stranger. She worries about her appearance and whether her husband will be weird or short.

This is followed by a scene where Sheridan appears distressed, holding their head and crumpling sheet music, symbolizing the pressure and scrutiny they faced regarding their personal life.\n\nThe scene transitions to Sheridan walking down a staircase with journalist Tara Brown. Sheridan talks about their time at NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art) in Sydney, recalling how past students would return and share their experiences. They mention enjoying these interactions.\n\nBrown reveals that during Sheridan's time at NIDA, they were attracted to both men and women. However, they were advised to keep their sexuality private to avoid jeopardizing their career.\n\nSheridan confirms this, sharing an incident where two teachers took them into an office and warned them not to tell anyone about their sexuality, claiming it would ruin their career prospects. Sheridan notes that both teachers were openly gay themselves. Brown points out that Sheridan's sexuality was more fluid than people assumed.\n\nThe narrative shifts to Sheridan's relationships. After their first male relationship ended, they started dating a woman again. Sheridan expresses that those who know them personally are aware of their relationships with both men and women. They acknowledge that this has caused confusion for some.\n\nSheridan then discusses their decision to write an essay about their experiences. They explain that they felt it was time to share their story, to pull back the curtain on the real Hugh.\n\nA magazine cover featuring Sheridan is shown, with the headline \"Packed To The Rafters' Hugh Sheridan addresses rumours about sexuality.\" The cover mentions Sheridan's essay and interview, highlighting their honesty and vulnerability.\n\nSheridan states that the essay was a liberating experience, despite the difficulty they had in labeling themselves. They clarify that the main message of the essay was that it's okay not to have all the answers.\n\nBrown asks Sheridan about the labels they used in the essay. Sheridan confirms using the label \"Hugh,\" but mentions being labeled \"non-binary\" by others and using the pronouns \"they/them,\" even though they personally identify with \"he/him.\" They explain that they didn't correct the mislabeling at the time because they were scared.\n\nBrown then asks about Sheridan's previous statement of being bisexual. Sheridan explains that they felt it was important to be honest in the article and express their attraction to both men and women. They acknowledge the evolving landscape of labels and express that they haven't found one that perfectly fits them.\n\nThe conversation turns to Sheridan's marriage. Brown asks if they were married, and Sheridan confirms they were, for nine years. They reveal that the story of their marriage broke when they got engaged to someone else, and it was published on the front page of a magazine. Sheridan reflects that they didn't feel like they were lying or being secretive about their marriage, it just didn't seem necessary to make it public.\n\nBrown asks if Sheridan believes it's acceptable to sacrifice someone's career for a bigger political point. Sheridan responds that certain actions are unacceptable, particularly those that harm or segregate others. They then shift the focus to the broader question of who should be allowed to tell certain stories in acting. They use examples of actors portraying characters like Adolf Hitler or terrorists, emphasizing that playing a role doesn't equate to being that person in real life.\n\nSheridan expresses their desire to see more transgender people playing transgender characters, rather than having cisgender actors portray them.\n\nThe conversation concludes with Sheridan discussing their current role in \"Tick, Tick… Boom!\" They describe it as a joyful experience and express their appreciation for the story's themes of determination and perseverance.\n\nThe video ends with Tara Brown providing information about the program's social media presence and streaming options, followed by the show's closing credits.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes (news program logo)\n* NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art logo)\n* Stellar Magazine (magazine cover)\n* Amazon Prime Video (mentioned in Stellar Magazine article)\n* Nine Now (streaming service logo)\n* Lifeline (helpline logo)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Stage performances showcasing Sheridan's talents\n* Photoshoot setting where Sheridan appears distressed\n* Staircase in a modern building (NIDA)\n* Interview setting with Tara Brown\n* Magazine cover featuring Sheridan\n* Theatre stage with brick backdrop (Tick, Tick… Boom! performance)\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Sexuality and fluidity\n* Public vs. private life\n* Pressure and scrutiny in the entertainment industry\n* Importance of representation in acting\n* Perseverance and determination\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Hugh Sheridan (actor and singer)\n* Tara Brown (journalist)\n* Rafael De La Fuente (Sheridan's ex-husband, mentioned)\n* Jonathan Larson (playwright of \"Tick, Tick… Boom!\", mentioned in the magazine article)\n* Adolf Hitler (mentioned as an example of a challenging character to portray)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14903527,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19193311},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.105210766,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13117331},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.18832432,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16559348},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.26133114,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20307489}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1062,"promptTokenCount":843053,"totalTokenCount":844115}}}

The interviewer asks her about her experience playing for the royals. She responds that they are great and wonderful. She has played for King Charles many times and used to be invited to St. James's Palace to play for his dinner parties. The interviewer jokes that if he has people over, he puts on a Spotify playlist, but King Charles can call the violinist up and put on a big show. The violinist laughs and says that King Charles likes live music. She adds that he is one of the biggest classical music fans and really cares about it. He needs it in his life. He once told her at Buckingham Palace that classical music keeps him sane, calms him, and grounds him. He needs it in his life. The interviewer jokes that the violinist is the key to the king's sanity. She laughs and says, \"Apparently so.\" She adds that she'll let herself think that for one minute.\n\nThe scene transitions to a choir singing in a church, accompanied by a string orchestra. The narrator says that it is beautiful music, the perfect soundtrack to a day the king will never forget.\n\nThe scene transitions back to the violinist, who is now wearing a black leather jacket and a silver scarf. She says that she thinks she has had one of the best days of her life and asks how she can top this. The interviewer says that it sounds like she is floating. She responds that she just didn't want it to end. She was like, \"Oh my god, there's that person! Oh my god, there's that person! There's Joanna Lumley! There's Emma Thompson! There's Stephen Fry! Oh my god, there's Boris Johnson!\" She adds that it's almost like the music was so good that it transcended the occasion itself. She just thought, \"Man, I am proud to be here!\"\n\nThe scene transitions to a procession of soldiers on horseback, followed by a golden carriage carrying King Charles and Queen Camilla. The narrator asks what exactly we can expect from our new king and queen.\n\nThe scene transitions to an interview with a man in a suit, who is having afternoon tea with the interviewer. He says that nobody in the history of the British monarchy has come to the throne better prepared.\n\nThe scene transitions to the title card for the segment, \"The King and Us.\"\n\nThe scene transitions to a man getting dressed in a suit. He says that it was absolutely a privilege to be part of history and of something which only comes along once in a generation. It's a huge moment for anyone who's going to play a part in it.\n\nThe scene transitions to an invitation to the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. The narrator says that when King Charles calls, Scott Furssedon-Wood answers. He adds that really, who in their right mind could refuse an invite as glorious as this one.\n\nThe scene transitions to Scott Furssedon-Wood, who is now sitting in a chair and being interviewed. He says that it is a bit of a pinch-yourself moment. He told his dad about it, and his dad has a memory of watching the coronation on the tiny screen of a rented television, the only television set in his street when he was growing up. He doesn't think his dad ever expected that his son one day would be in Westminster Abbey for a coronation.\n\nThe scene transitions to King Charles getting off an airplane. The narrator says that Scott represents the king as Britain's High Commissioner designate to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. But prior to that, the pair was almost inseparable, having spent four years traveling the world together when Scott was Charles's deputy private secretary.\n\nThe scene transitions to King Charles and Queen Camilla looking at souvenirs at a market stall. King Charles asks if he is allowed to buy one or two things. The narrator says that on every royal tour from 2017 to 2021, you'll see Scott hovering in the background, never too far from his boss's side, there to sort out any issue, no matter how big or small.\n\nThe scene transitions back to Scott Furssedon-Wood, who is still being interviewed. The interviewer asks if there is anything that jumps out at him that kind of paints a picture of the kind of man Charles is. Scott responds that his mom got very sick with cancer, and it all ended very quickly in the end. Charles never met his mom and had no idea who she was, but he took time, without Scott knowing, to send her a very long and incredibly thoughtful handwritten letter, which arrived in the hospital with a big bouquet of flowers. In the letter, Charles said how very sorry he was to hear that she was so unwell and that he hoped she would find some comfort in those last few days in her pride in Scott and the rest of his family. Scott says that this is just one small example of the sort of thing that Charles would do time and again. The interviewer says that for so many people in the public, they see that stony face of the royals, but Scott has seen the big heart. Scott responds that he thinks that's right because that's just who Charles is. It's not an act; it's not something he puts on for the cameras or for the audience. It's just who he is. Scott thinks that Charles believes that for the monarchy to endure and to be relevant in people's lives, that connection is really important.\n\nThe scene transitions to King Charles and Queen Camilla meeting a group of schoolchildren. The narrator says that Charles is a workaholic.\n\nThe scene transitions back to the interview with the man in a suit, who is still having afternoon tea with the interviewer. He says that Charles is literally a workaholic. He remembers the queen taking him into Charles's study once to talk about some charitable venture, and the desk was piled high with papers. They couldn't see Charles anywhere. Eventually, a head popped up. He was there but surrounded by so much paperwork.\n\nThe scene transitions to a black-and-white photo of Queen Elizabeth II and a man in a suit. The narrator says that as a longtime friend of Charles's parents, Giles Brandreth has had many an afternoon tea with the royal family.\n\nThe scene transitions back to the interview with the man in a suit. He is now pouring tea into a cup. He says that unlike a true Brit, he is not having any milk. The interviewer says that Charles says the new king and queen are just infatuated with each other. The man in a suit says that interestingly, in a way, Elizabeth and Philip were not. He adds that the Duke of Edinburgh once said to him, \"Love consists not necessarily in gazing into one another's eyes but looking in the same direction.\" He adds that what you get with Charles and Camilla are a couple who do look into one another's eyes but also are looking in the same direction. They have common values. The interviewer says that Camilla is almost the yin to Charles's yang. The man in a suit says that he thinks they probably like all that, but he's not quite sure what that means. He's not going to agree with it in case it's something a little bit unsuitable. But they beautifully do. They do complement each other. They work tremendously well as a team.\n\nThe scene transitions to King Charles and the man in a suit talking at an event. The man in a suit is wearing a purple sweater with a corgi on it. The narrator says that Giles believes Charles is trying to position himself as a man in touch with the plight of the everyday person, typified by his choice to have a comparatively modest coronation, if you can call it that.\n\nThe scene transitions to King Charles being crowned. The interviewer asks if there was significance to the fact that this was scaled back. The man in a suit responds that 2023 has been very different from 1953. This time, it was curtailed, partly because the king was sensitive to times being tough. There was a bit of a tension between us, the people, saying, \"Give us the spectacle! We want people in bearskins! We want marching bands! We want all that!\" And the king saying, \"Let's not spend too much money.\" The interviewer says, \"A thrifty king.\" The man in a suit agrees, \"A thrifty king. A thrifty king. And thrifty with the guest list. I felt very honored to be invited because there were only 2,200 people invited this time, whereas last time there were 8,200 people. So a quarter of the number of people. This is history that passes before us.\"\n\nThe scene transitions to King Charles holding a golden orb. The narrator says that Giles has no doubt the biggest challenge ahead for King Charles is staying relevant, a task not made any easier by the fact he's the oldest monarch to ever be crowned.\n\nThe scene transitions back to the interview with the man in a suit. He says that Charles is going to be 75 in November. But because he comes from a long-lived family, his mother lived to 96, his father to 99, his grandmother to 101, he could well be king for 25 years. The interviewer says that it's funny when you put it like that, you know, who starts a new career at 74? The man in a suit responds, \"And you've got to make it work. The reason I think it will work and does work is because we know enough about King Charles to be, you know, confident. Nobody in the history of the British monarchy has come to the throne better prepared.\"\n\nThe scene transitions to a group of soldiers marching in formation. The narrator says that tens of thousands of people lined London's streets, even in the pouring rain, just to catch a glimpse of the coronation.\n\nThe scene transitions to a group of protesters holding signs that say \"Not My King.\" The narrator says that most of them were celebrating our new king and queen, but some turned up purely in protest.\n\nThe scene transitions to a statue of Queen Elizabeth II. The narrator says that it shows even on the monarchy's best day, loads of people still want to get rid of it, especially in Australia.\n\nThe scene transitions to an interview with Craig Foster AM. He says, \"I think the way that Australia is looking at the crown in its entirety is very different to during all of Elizabeth's reign because there is a movement within so much of the Commonwealth, which, having it now, it's really, you know, open slather, if you like. And everyone can question the crown in a very different way. I'm excited to see how Australia responds to it.\"\n\nThe scene transitions to Craig Foster AM sitting at a table. The text \"CRAIG FOSTER AM\" appears on the screen. The narrator says that Craig Foster is the new co-chair of the Australian Republican Movement, pushing to scrap the monarchy.\n\nThe scene transitions to a soccer game.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\nSpotify, Honda, Lion Red, Sovereign, Sanyo, Prince of Wales (pub)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* A room with a dark background\n* A room with shelves of violins and cellos\n* St. James's Palace\n* Buckingham Palace\n* A church with a choir and orchestra\n* A park with a path\n* A street with flags and a golden carriage\n* A room with blue curtains and a tea set\n* A bathroom with a mirror\n* Westminster Abbey\n* An airplane\n* A market stall\n* A schoolyard\n* A train station\n* A pub\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* King Charles III's coronation\n* The role of music in King Charles's life\n* The public's perception of the royals\n* The future of the monarchy in Australia\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* King Charles III\n* Queen Camilla\n* Violinist (unnamed)\n* Narrator\n* Interviewer\n* Joanna Lumley\n* Emma Thompson\n* Stephen Fry\n* Boris Johnson\n* Scott Furssedon-Wood\n* Giles Brandreth\n* Craig Foster AM\n* Queen Elizabeth II\n* Duke of Edinburgh (Prince Philip)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09009325,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14223208},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07055965,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1550786},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.123365745,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16559348},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.13206623,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1801067}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":2619,"promptTokenCount":177237,"totalTokenCount":179856}}}

The reporter mentions that Tina Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock in 1939. She picked cotton as a young girl living in Tennessee. Her mother was a survivor of domestic violence. At 11, she was taken in by her grandmother in Nutbush, a rural community which she made famous in song. In 1957, Anna Mae met Ike Turner. Their partnership changed her life, finding success through the Ike and Tina Turner Revue. They married and had children, but Ike was an abuser. After 16 years, she left him. The next chapter saw her head down under. Soon, Tina found big-screen stardom, filming Mad Max in Coober Pedy with Mel Gibson. Then, she was beamed into homes, energizing footy fans with \"The Best.\" Her Australian manager, Roger Davies, is credited with her extraordinary comeback. Today, he said, “I will miss her deeply.” And for all of Tina’s success, she never stopped searching for something. She found it with Erwin Bach, a German actor and music producer who would give her his kidney when she became sick. This was her final on-stage performance in 2009. She bowed out with 12 Grammys, a Lifetime Achievement Award, record-breaking tours, and 180 million album sales. She stepped away from the spotlight battling cancer, seeking a quieter life with her husband in Switzerland. Her life’s story inspired a musical, hitting the West End and Broadway. Here in Hollywood, outside Capitol Records, the label that helped reignite her career, a star and flowers, a chance for fans to mourn the loss but also remember the life and music of Tina Turner.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about the death of Clare Nowland, a 95-year-old woman who was tasered in her Cooma nursing home. The reporter mentions that police allege Senior Constable Kristian White said “bugger it” as he deployed his taser. Police allege Mrs. Nowland was holding a steak knife when the officer said “stop” several times and “drop it.” She raised the knife to chest height in his colleague’s direction. Senior Constable White asked her to stop before deploying the taser, saying “bugger it.” He is very distressed. His lawyer doesn’t think there is any dispute that on his way to this particular job that it was in his wildest dreams that the matter would unfold in the way that it may have. The 33-year-old is charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. His lawyer anticipates that he’d enter a plea of not guilty. All these matters will be reviewed when a brief of evidence is received. The charges could be upgraded to manslaughter, but investigators will have to wait on the result of an autopsy as they need to prove that the tasering caused the injuries that led to Mrs. Nowland’s death. Today, news of the much-loved volunteer’s death hit home. People in the community are saddened by the news and feel that it is unfortunate that Cooma has been put on the map under unfortunate circumstances. Mrs. Nowland was a mother to eight, grandmother to 24, and great-grandmother to 31. She left a wonderful legacy.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about rising electricity bills. The reporter mentions that from July 1, energy retailers will hike their rates. Standing offers in New South Wales and Queensland will rise from July 1. Household bills in New South Wales up on average over $480 for the year. Queensland prices are expected to rise by $400. Small businesses will see jumps of at least 15%. The Albanese government says there are steps to help you save. Those include induction cooktops, household batteries, electric hot water, and insulation available to subsidized homes. Energy providers are required to offer assistance to Australians who can’t afford their bills. The government may have to offer a little more assistance in the future as well.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about a 64-year-old man who has been charged over a spate of alleged sexual touching incidents in Sydney spanning two decades. He is accused of inappropriately touching four women. The first reported incident was in 2002. He was arrested on Elizabeth Street at Liverpool this morning.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about a pitch invader who has pleaded guilty to assaulting Dragons player Zac Lomax while causing a spectacle during the Anzac Day NRL match against the Roosters. 19-year-old Curtis Quealy has already been banned from New South Wales stadiums for two years. Next month, the Maroubra man will learn his punishment in court.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about Melissa Caddick’s disappearance. The reporter mentions that Melissa Caddick’s disappearance may forever remain a mystery. An inquest was unable to determine how the fraudster died. There were chaotic scenes outside court today after husband Anthony Koletti was slammed by a coroner. His account was riddled with inconsistencies, sparking suspicion he’s hiding something. Does Anthony Koletti know more than he’s letting on? Married to the country’s biggest con woman and now suspected of a cover-up, an accusation he is clearly not happy about. He had some awareness of Ms. Caddick’s movements but he chose not to disclose it. Melissa Caddick vanished the morning after ASIC raided her Dover Heights home in 2020. Police were initially suspicious of her husband. The theory changed as a $20 million Ponzi scheme was unraveled. Was Caddick hiding, murdered, or did she take her own life? Then, the conspiracy: the mother amputated her own limb after her shoe and foot washed up on the South Coast. The inquest put an end to any speculation. The fraudster could still be living among us. It is possible Melissa Caddick jumped from the cliffs here at Dover Heights, but the coroner found there’s not enough evidence to prove that.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\nNine News, Wide World of

Jesse is reading aloud a list of Claire's positive qualities from his phone. He describes her as a party starter, instigator, kind, honest, communicative, courageous, curious, and fun, adding that her fun is infectious. Claire laughs and playfully pinches Jesse's cheek before hugging him.\n\nClaire, facing the camera, expresses her happiness with Jesse's words, saying they were exactly what she wanted to hear. She gives him an A+ and praises him for doing well.\n\nA narrator explains that after a week apart, Claire and Jesse have overcome their earlier troubles and will once again be living together in the same apartment as husband and wife.\n\nClaire reiterates her affection for Jesse, stating that she's ready for him to move back and give their marriage a good crack. She lists his good qualities: fun, relaxed, charismatic, good energy, and making her laugh a lot.\n\nClaire and Jesse are seen returning to their apartment. Claire expresses her positive feelings about the week and days ahead, mentioning a dinner party and commitment ceremony. She refers to Jesse as \"my person,\" then corrects herself and clarifies that he may be her person, but she's not sure yet.\n\nJesse returns to the apartment, and Claire burns sage to cleanse the space of negative energy. Jesse expresses his optimism about their marriage, feeling they are in a good place and ready to face challenges together. He compares their relationship to a salt and pepper shaker. Claire agrees, saying she loves the peaceful atmosphere.\n\nThe scene shifts to another couple, Duncan and Alyssa. Duncan is researching dance classes in Sydney on his laptop. The narrator mentions that Duncan's thoughtful gesture takes the couple two steps back.\n\nAlyssa is shown laying on a bed while Duncan gives her a massage. She expresses her appreciation for Duncan's efforts to make her feel relaxed and comfortable. She also acknowledges his \"steamy, saucy side.\" When asked if sex could be on the cards tonight, Alyssa smiles and seems open to the possibility. Duncan expresses his hope that the massage will lead to intimacy. He compares their physical connection to tectonic plates colliding.\n\nThe scene changes to Layton and Melinda. Layton is searching for dance classes on his laptop. The narrator reveals that after a rocky start to intimacy week, Layton is planning a surprise date to get them back in step. Layton explains that he struggles with deep connection and intimacy, but he knows Melinda wants to go deeper. He hopes the dance date will build an emotional connection.\n\nLayton and Melinda arrive at a dance studio. They are greeted by Jamie and Geo, the dance instructors. Melinda expresses her enjoyment of the dance lesson and appreciates Layton's effort. The scene flashes back to their wedding day, where they shared their first dance. Melinda admits she doesn't know how to dance, and Layton assures her to follow his lead.\n\nBack in the present, Melinda and Layton continue their dance lesson. Melinda expresses her happiness with the experience and feels closer to Layton.\n\nThe scene returns to Caitlin and Shannon. Caitlin expresses her disappointment with Shannon's lack of effort during intimacy week.

Fleming's rampage was described as terrifying, but not the work of a terrorist. The Supreme Court ruled that these were the actions of a man who belonged in a hospital rather than prison. Fleming's rampage involved dressing in combat black, arming himself with a rifle, gel blaster, and a fake bomb, and taking two men hostage inside a Windang dive shop. A USB containing plans for a similar outburst was discovered after Fleming surrendered. He warned that the planned outburst would \"make the Cronulla riots look like a kindergarten field trip.\" Fleming pleaded not guilty, arguing that he had no understanding of what he had done because he suffered from schizophrenia. Four weeks into the trial, the Crown case collapsed after the evidence of a right-wing extremist expert was thrown out. The judge ordered the jury to clear Fleming of the terrorism charge. Eleven other firearm and kidnap offenses will be dealt with on mental health grounds. Fleming's solicitor, Aaron Kernaghan, stated that Fleming felt like he had been heard for the first time. Fleming's family will now take action against the DPP to cover their legal bill.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about a car and motorcycle crash on Warringah Road at Forestville. The crash caused chaos during the morning peak, forcing two of three westbound lanes to shut. No one was seriously injured.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about the fallout from the tasering of a 95-year-old great-grandmother, Clare Nowland, inside her Cooma nursing home. The police officer who tasered her has been suspended from the force with full pay. Nowland's family remains by her side in the hospital. A worker at Yallambee Lodge, where Nowland resided, has received death threats. Senior Constable Christian White, a local officer with 12 years of experience, is at the center of one of the force's biggest internal probes. Police initially held back crucial details, then stated that Nowland was approaching police with a knife. Nowland's family released a statement expressing their profound love and affection for her and thanking Cooma and the world for the outpouring of support for her and her ongoing battle with dementia.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about Premier Chris Minns being accused of \"class warfare\" over his stamp duty reforms for first home buyers. Buyers entering the market will pay no stamp duty on homes up to $800,000 under legislation put before state parliament. The legislation will also scrap a scheme that offers a choice of paying an upfront lump sum or a lower annual fee on homes up to $1.5 million.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about Qantas announcing a record underlying profit of close to $2.5 billion for this financial year. This would be almost a billion dollars higher than its previous record in 2018. The Transport Workers' Union is unimpressed, calling on the airline to pay back the $2.7 billion in taxpayer support it received during the pandemic. Michael Kaine, from the Transport Workers' Union, criticizes Qantas for the illegal sacking of 1,700 workers and for airfares and service standards being \"through the roof.\"\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about Australian athletes preparing for the Paris Olympics. The athletes road-tested the uniforms they hope will propel them to gold medal glory. They will be guided by cycling legend Anna Meares, who will be Australia's Chef de Mission in Paris. The Nine Network has announced that it has added the Paralympics to its Olympics broadcast, with exclusive coverage across its media platforms.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a weather report for Sydney. It has been a beautiful blue sky day with light southeasterly winds, but the morning was freezing. Camden and Richmond dipped to 0 degrees, Horsley Park, Campbelltown, and Canterbury fell to 2 degrees, and Bankstown fell to 3 degrees. The city fell to just under 8 degrees before warming up to nearly 20 degrees in the afternoon sunshine. Penrith dipped to just below 3 degrees. Another cold and mostly clear night is on the way, but there could be some rain this week.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about a miracle on the M4. Two police officers escaped injury after a truck slammed into the back of their patrol car at Merrylands. The officers were talking to the driver of a Toyota Land Cruiser they had just pulled over at around 10:30 last night when a semi-trailer careered into the back of their highway patrol vehicle, launching it into the four-wheel drive they were standing next to. The 29-year-old truck driver has been fined for negligent driving.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about an unexpected water feature springing to life on the Northern Beaches. A water main exploded at Manly Vale just after midday, gushing water high into the air. It did not cause any traffic problems.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about a senior investigator in the Bruce Lehrmann case stating that police were worried about hauling him before the court because of a perceived lack of evidence. Scott Moller told an inquiry that he was eventually convinced to lay a sexual assault charge, but some of his colleagues didn't feel the same way.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\nNine News\nNSW Lotteries\nNSW Police Force\nToday\nQantas\nHSBC\nTWU (Transport Workers Union)\nAIS (Australian Institute of Sport)\nSportscraft\nVolley\nCanon\nChelsea Flower Show\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\nNews studio with a backdrop of the Sydney skyline at night\nWindang dive shop\nForestville, Warringah Road\nYallambee Lodge, Cooma\nCooma Hospital\nSydney West Trial Courts\nNSW Parliament\nReal estate auction\nAirport with Qantas airplanes\nOlympic uniform fitting room\nToday Show studio\nM4 motorway, Merrylands\nManly Vale, Kenneth Road\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\nCrime and justice\nRoad accidents\nPolice misconduct\nHousing affordability\nCorporate profits and accountability\nOlympics and Paralympics preparations\nWeather\nBreaking news\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\nPeter Overton (news anchor)\nSimon Fleming\nAaron Kernaghan (Simon Fleming's solicitor)\nTiffiney Genders (chief court reporter)\nClare Nowland\nChristian White (senior constable)\nFr.

Claire, with long brown hair and gold hoop earrings, wears a black short-sleeved top and khaki pants. Jesse, with a man bun and tattoos on his arms, wears a dark blue short-sleeved top and white pants. They have a charcuterie board, crackers, and two glasses of a yellow drink in front of them. A bottle of Prosecco sits near the glasses. Claire tells Jesse that the door is metaphorically open for him to return, but shut for safety purposes. She smiles and tells him to let her know if he decides to return, and they will be happy to have him. Jesse smiles and nods.\n\nThe scene cuts to Jesse sitting on a bed with an orange pillow behind him. He says that his and Claire's connection has taken a healthy step in the right direction after tonight.\n\nThe scene cuts back to Claire and Jesse in the kitchen area. Claire is now wearing a beige, fuzzy cardigan. She throws a crumpled ball of paper at some empty plastic water bottles set up like bowling pins in the hallway outside the kitchen. She knocks them all down. Jesse laughs and covers his face with his hands. Claire runs back into the kitchen and celebrates. She then runs out into the hallway again and throws her arms up in victory. Jesse continues to laugh. Claire returns to the kitchen and hugs Jesse. She tells him that she is sure he is good at something in life, but bowling is not one of them. They hug again.\n\nThe scene cuts to a shot of the Sydney Opera House at sunset. Then, it shows a street in Sydney at night, with cars driving by. A sign for Skye Suites is shown.\n\nThe scene cuts to Bronte sitting on a bed in a hotel room. She wears a black long-sleeved top, olive green cargo pants, and a white headband. She says that Harrison sent her a message about a date, and she wonders what would make him think that she would want to spend more than two seconds with him. She calls him a gaslighter and a liar, and says that she stormed down and told him she was done. She wonders why he would still plan a date, just to make himself look good. She says that Harrison does whatever he wants. She says she feels awful and that she came into the suite with high hopes, but has been constantly let down by Harrison. She says it is really disappointing. A producer asks her what she thinks Harrison would have done for her. She replies that he would have wined and dined someone on the coastline. She wipes a tear from her eye.\n\nThe scene cuts to a framed photo of Harrison and his wife on their wedding day. Harrison, wearing a blue suit and tie, stands next to his wife, who wears a white wedding dress and holds a bouquet of white flowers. A hand holding a glass of wine is seen in front of the photo.\n\nThe scene cuts to a view of the Sydney skyline at night. A boat moves across the water. Then, Harrison is shown sitting on a bench by the water. He wears a white Tommy Jeans sweatshirt, light blue jeans, and a red baseball cap. He says that he asked Bronte out and she said no. He takes a sip of wine from a wine glass. He says that he wanted to go last night, but at Bronte's request, he stayed and is here doing the work. He says that Bronte is not there. He says that he made the commitment to stay there another week and work on the relationship, and he is going to do that with or without Bronte. A framed photo of Harrison and his wife is shown again. A producer asks him if he feels awkward being on the date on his own. He replies that he does not mind, he has his wife with him. He says that people come from all over Sydney to chill there. He says that it has honestly been one of the best dates he has had in a long time. They have done everything he wanted to do. He asks the producer if they are hungry. The producer replies that they are. Harrison says that he feels like he and his wife have shared a lot and been intimate, and had fun tonight. He asks if the producer had fun.

She says it is so thoughtful, like something from everyone. She says that Josh gets a tick.\n\nMelissa says that there was feedback yesterday from Alessandra about making an effort. Josh says that he is very hopeful that Melissa can see the effort he is trying to show. Melissa asks Josh about his childhood and if he built Lego growing up. Josh says that they were outside kids, and his parents would have dinner parties. He says that they were the cheeky kids that would sneak downstairs to see what the adults were doing, and all the kids would come to their house and have snacks because his parents owned a supermarket. Melissa is surprised. Josh says that he didn't think she would be that talkative. Melissa says that when she would get in trouble, she would say it was her twin sister. Josh asks if they were ever in the same class. Melissa replies that they were, but then they had to separate them because they talked too much. Josh laughs. Melissa says that she didn't think he would be that talkative. Josh says that it was a great conversation. He says that if he had known that Lego was going to bring them closer together, he probably would have reached into his Lego inventory at home a lot sooner in their relationship. He says that they can see it is starting to take shape. Melissa asks if he is talking about their relationship. Josh replies no. Melissa laughs. She says that this is a really good activity. Josh says that he doesn't feel like a sex object today. He says that he actually feels like they are bonding and talking about their childhoods, which they haven't done the entire time they have been together. Melissa says that when she was a twin, she never knew what it was like to be lonely because she always had someone there. Josh says that is nice. Melissa says that when she would get in trouble, she would say it was her twin sister. Josh asks if they were ever in the same class. Melissa replies that they were, then they had to be separated because they talked too much. Josh laughs. Melissa says that you can see how that happens. Josh says that he didn't think she would be that talkative. Melissa says that it's like intimacy week, but it keeps going the way that it's going. She hopes they can rip open their goody bags and have some fun together.\n\nThe scene cuts to a view of the Sydney skyline. A brick building with arched windows is shown.\n\nAlessandra, wearing a blue dress, knocks on a door with a sign that reads \"Claire & Jesse.\" Claire, wearing a pink t-shirt and black shorts, opens the door. Alessandra enters and hugs Claire. Claire calls Jesse on the phone and tells him that Alessandra is there and asks if he can come down. Jesse says that he is reading the Kama Sutra book that Alessandra gave them. Claire laughs and tells him that speaking of Alessandra, she is there and asks if he can come down. Jesse says wow and asks her to give him a second. Claire says she will see him soon and hangs up. Alessandra says that is amazing. Claire says that she is excited but a little bit nervous. Alessandra says good, that means this means something to her. Claire says that of course it does.\n\nThe scene cuts to Alessandra, wearing a brown shirt, sitting in a room with a blurred background. She says that for Claire and Jesse, the experiment has been very challenging so far. They have had to negotiate a lot of obstacles, but it is encouraging to see that they have started to repair their relationship. She hopes the exercises will help them this week.\n\nA framed photo of Lyndall and Cameron on their wedding day is shown. Lyndall wears a white wedding dress and holds a bouquet of flowers. Cameron wears a red suit.\n\nAlessandra, Claire, and Jesse are sitting in a living room. Alessandra, wearing a blue dress, sits in a chair. Claire and Jesse sit on a brown couch. Alessandra tells them that coming into this week, she thinks it is clear to both of them that the intent is not necessarily to push anything to happen between them, but to build connection. She says her idea for them is to go back to basics and start from the very beginning and see if they can build a space of trust and a space of safety. She asks if they are ready. Claire and Jesse say okay. Alessandra tells them to get up and stand in front of one another, facing each other. She tells them to step forward, hug, and put their arms around each other. She tells them to get their knees closer together. She tells them to simply feel their heartbeats and see what that is like.\n\nJesse says that hugging Claire like that was a little bit like, \"Oh, this is really, really nice.\" He says he is not used to that, but standing there for a few minutes, he could feel himself becoming more and more relaxed. He says it was a touching moment and he would like to do more hugging like that with Claire.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Prosecco\n* Gucci (belt buckle)\n* Skye Suites\n* Tommy Jeans\n* New Era (baseball cap)\n* New York Yankees (baseball cap logo)\n* Lacoste\n* Lego\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Kitchen area with a table and chairs\n* Bedroom with an orange pillow\n* Hallway with empty water bottles set up like bowling pins\n* Sydney Opera House\n* Sydney street at night\n* Hotel room with a bed\n* Coastline at night\n* Restaurant\n* Living room with a couch and coffee table\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Relationship building and connection\n* Trust and safety in relationships\n* Vulnerability and intimacy\n* Communication and effort in relationships\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Claire\n* Jesse\n* Bronte\n* Harrison\n* Alessandra Rampolla (Clinical Sexologist)\n* Melissa\n* Josh"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09534948,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1066907},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09807943,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1510279},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.111241356,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1550786},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.4576217,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.44143292}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":2370,"promptTokenCount":1186728,"totalTokenCount":1189098}}}

He discusses his advocacy for Australia becoming a republic, emphasizing his belief that the country's leader should be \"one of us.\"\n\nThe scene transitions to archival footage of the 1999 Australian republic referendum, showing people voting and campaign signs for both the \"yes\" and \"no\" sides. The narrator explains that the \"no\" campaign won with 54.9% of the vote, with republicans arguing that the majority of Australians wanted to ditch the monarchy but couldn't agree on the best model for electing a president.\n\nThe scene cuts back to Foster, who reiterates his view that Australia should be governed by Australians, not \"foreign overlords.\" He expresses his desire for another referendum in the next five years and his confidence that it will succeed this time.\n\nThe interviewer asks Foster if he thinks enough people care about the issue, pointing out that whoever is the head of state won't fix the cost of living crisis or potholes. Foster responds by suggesting that the interviewer ask First Nations leaders about the meaning of colonization and multicultural communities about their representation in institutions. He emphasizes the importance of standing for something, both domestically and internationally.\n\nThe scene shifts to archival footage of King Charles and Queen Camilla holding koalas, followed by a scene of the interviewer having tea with a man named Giles Brandreth, a British writer, broadcaster, and former Member of Parliament. Brandreth expresses his love for the Crown and his belief that sometimes it's better to stick with the devil you know. He suggests that if Australia did become a republic, the King would still want to retain close ties between the two countries. He also expresses his view that the King is there to serve and that if Australians don't want him as head of state, that's fine. He adds that he believes the royals love the Commonwealth and Australia and would still visit even if Australia became a republic.\n\nThe scene transitions to a preview of the next segment, \"Hammer Blow,\" which focuses on the construction industry crisis in Victoria. The preview shows images of damaged buildings and interviews with people affected by shoddy workmanship. The reporter, Christina Hearn, states that the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) is supposed to protect consumers from dodgy construction companies but is not doing its job.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the studio, where the host introduces the \"Hammer Blow\" segment. The reporter explains that the VBA's inaction is a crushing blow for people trying to build a roof over their heads, especially in Victoria, where the construction industry is in crisis. She adds that the VBA's own employees say the culture within the organization is dangerously toxic.\n\nThe segment then shows footage of a woman named Ann, who bought a half-million-dollar apartment that turned out to be nothing. The reporter explains that Ann wholeheartedly believed the VBA had her back and was confident she was doing the right thing with her home builder. However, 15 months after construction, she uncovered 50 defects, a direct result of shoddy workmanship, including significant water damage, dangerous cladding, and walls that weren't fireproofed. The builder even locked Ann out of the property, leaving her with no option but to terminate the contract to regain access.\n\nThe segment concludes with an interview with Phil Dwyer, a building inspector, who says that there are buildings like Ann's all over the country. He adds that the VBA is supposed to look after compliance but is failing to do so, allowing dodgy builders and plumbers to get away with shoddy work.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Honda\n* Lion Red\n* ASB Bank\n* Sovereign\n* Nike\n* Vladivar\n* IKEA\n* Australian Republic Movement\n* 2UE\n* 2GB\n* The Micky Stewart Members' Pavilion\n* Rolls-Royce\n* Castran Gilbert\n* Victorian Building Authority (VBA)\n* Century 21\n* BuildSpect\n* Porter Davis Homes\n* Dulux Professional\n* Zurnings\n* good shed\n* Thales\n* Crown Plaza\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Soccer field: Craig Foster is shown in a soccer context, likely referencing his past career.\n* Parliament House, Canberra: Images of Parliament House are shown, particularly during the discussion of the republic referendum.\n* Interview setting: Foster is interviewed in a studio setting.\n* Archival footage of the 1999 referendum: Scenes of voting and campaign signs are shown.\n* Coastal area: Foster and the interviewer are shown at a coastal location, possibly Kurnell, the site of Captain Cook's landing.\n* London street: The interviewer and Giles Brandreth are shown walking down a London street.\n* Tea room: The interviewer and Brandreth have tea and discuss the monarchy.\n* Construction site: The \"Hammer Blow\" segment features various construction sites in Victoria.\n* VBA headquarters: The reporter stands outside the VBA headquarters in Melbourne.\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Australian republic debate: Foster's advocacy for a republic and the historical context of the 1999 referendum are central themes.\n* Colonialism and representation: Foster raises the issue of representation for First Nations and multicultural communities.\n* Construction industry crisis: The \"Hammer Blow\" segment exposes issues of shoddy workmanship and the failure of regulatory bodies.\n* Consumer protection: The segment highlights the vulnerability of consumers in the face of inadequate building regulations.\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Craig Foster: Former soccer player and advocate for a republic.\n* Giles Brandreth: British writer, broadcaster, and former MP.\n* Christina Hearn: Reporter for the \"Hammer Blow\" segment.\n* Ann: Victim of shoddy construction work.\n* Phil Dwyer: Building inspector.\n* King Charles III: Current monarch of Australia.\n* Queen Camilla: Queen Consort of Australia."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.150029,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20055786},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.120025486,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.26740846},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2436427,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19559398},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09401007,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1302855}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1294,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178532}}}

He explains that the drug bust involved two Canadian women and a Canadian man traveling on a cruise ship. The women's luggage contained a third of the total haul, while the rest was found in a room occupied by the Canadian man. The street value of the drugs was over $20 million, making it the largest drug bust of its kind on board a cruise ship.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a couple being interviewed about the incident. The woman says they found out about what happened on the news. The man says he didn't feel worried for the women because they did the wrong thing. He adds that they were having fun and not expecting to get caught.\n\nThe news report then shows a montage of images of the two women traveling the world in luxury and documenting their experiences on social media. The news anchor reports that the two women are now behind bars.\n\nThe scene then shifts back to the couple being interviewed. The man says he didn't really feel worried for the women because they did the wrong thing. He adds that they were having fun and not expecting to get caught.\n\nThe news report then shows footage of the drugs being seized from the women's luggage. The drugs are wrapped in plastic and placed on a table. The news anchor reports that the women were charged with importing a commercial quantity of cocaine and were facing life behind bars.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a courthouse. The news anchor reports that the women's friendship fractured due to the prospect of life in prison. Isabel pleaded guilty almost immediately, while Melina tried unsuccessfully to pin the whole operation on her mate.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Isabel being interviewed. She says she knew what she was getting herself into and that she wanted the money. She adds that she knew it was illegal, but she didn't think she would get caught. She says she has learned the most valuable lesson of her life and is now more than happy to leave criminal enterprises to someone else.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a courtroom. The judge is sentencing Melina to eight years in prison. The judge says she doubts Melina is now the envy of others.\n\nThe scene then shifts to the Australian Border Force. The news anchor reports that the operation was a success. The superintendent says there's always another target. He adds that the people organizing these operations are smart and purposely remove themselves from the mules.\n\nThe scene then shifts back to Isabel being interviewed. She says she has learned the most valuable lesson of her life and is now more than happy to leave criminal enterprises to someone else.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a city street at night. The news anchor reports that there's one truth Isabel is still not revealing, and that's who put her up to it.\n\nThe scene then shifts back to the couple being interviewed. The man says that whoever put Isabel up to it should have been sacked. He adds that they should have just gotten a couple of old grandmothers, and they would have gotten away with it.\n\nThe scene then shifts back to Isabel being interviewed. She says she has learned the most valuable lesson of her life and is now more than happy to leave criminal enterprises to someone else.\n\nThe video segment ends with a preview of the next segment, which is about the rising cost of living in Australia.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n60 Minutes, Australian Federal Police, Australian Border Force, JD Sports\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\nInterview with police officer, Interview with couple, News report montage of women traveling, Footage of drugs being seized, Courthouse, Interview with Isabel, Courtroom sentencing, Australian Border Force, City street at night, Interview with couple, Interview with Isabel, Preview of next segment\n\n**KeyThemes**\nDrug bust on cruise ship, Consequences of crime, Friendship fractured by crime, Remorse and regret, Australian cost of living crisis\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\nPolice officer, Couple, Isabel Lagace, Melina Roberge, News anchor, Judge, Superintendent Graham Campbell, Barry Rose, Stephen Hamilton, Chantelle Schmidt"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.25091305,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19806427},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.25982565,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3918716},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.33633137,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.29259497},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.18126312,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.21601154}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":885,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178123}}}

The news anchors discuss the Rabbito’s impressive six-game winning streak and the Eels' return of Mitchell Moses. The segment then cuts to a live report from Allianz Stadium with Danika Mason and Brad Fittler. Mason asks Fittler about the impact of Moses' return on the Eels' chances tonight. Fittler acknowledges that Moses' kicking game gives the Eels a chance to win, but emphasizes that they will need more than that to beat the in-form Rabbito’s. He mentions that the Eels have struggled this season, only beating one top-eight team, and have been plagued by injuries. Mason points out that the Rabbito’s have been playing extremely well, especially during Indigenous Round, and have a history of strong performances in this particular game. Fittler confirms that the Rabbito’s have won this game for the past five years, and that they will be very hard to beat tonight. Mason thanks Fittler for his insights, and the segment returns to the studio.\n\nBack in the studio, the news anchor reports that Jerome Luai is available for Origin selection after avoiding suspension for contrary conduct. Luai touched a match official after a try and was fined $1800. The Panthers moved back to the top of the ladder with an 11-point win over the Broncos.\n\nThe segment then transitions to a discussion of Luke Brooks' future. Tim Sheens, the Tigers coach, reveals that the Tigers will offer Brooks a multi-year deal. Sheens acknowledges that Brooks will need to take a pay cut to remain a Tiger, given his current deal is worth around $1 million a season. Sheens expresses confidence in Brooks and says he is prepared for any blowback from the decision.\n\nThe segment then transitions to a discussion of Rafael Nadal's retirement plans. Nadal has confirmed that he is pulling out of the French Open due to a hip injury he sustained during the Australian Open. He initially believed he would be out for six to eight weeks, but after four months, he has still not regained full fitness. Nadal, who turns 37 next month, revealed that 2024 will likely be the year he retires. Todd Woodbridge comments on Nadal's retirement, saying that without Nadal, the era of incredible tennis that we have been able to witness with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic will be over.\n\nThe segment then transitions to a discussion of the US PGA Championship. Adam Scott is the best of the Australians after the opening day, three shots behind leader Eric Cole. However, it could have been so much better if it wasn't for a double bogey at the last. If Scott was feeling dirty after his poor finish, spare a thought for Korea's Tom Kim, who took a mud bath while searching for his ball in a hazard. To clean himself off, he took a dunk in a freshwater creek running through the course.\n\nThe segment then transitions to a discussion of energy savings. As winter approaches and electricity prices soar, many people are looking for ways to save without having to switch off the heater. One man says he's discovered the key to beat the chill and cut down on power bills. The 67-year-old rugs up, is vigilant about turning off everything not in use, and times his showers. He uses a cheap egg timer and has reduced his energy bills by more than 30%. He joined AGL's Peak Energy Rewards program, where customers are notified ahead of expected periods of high usage on the grid. They are then encouraged to switch off in return for bill credits. The target is not zero usage, but 10% less than average. Customers don't need to be home when it happens. Some customers have reduced their bills by $60 or $70 because they participated in multiple events. According to Canstar's research, Australians should brace for a big shock this winter, with average bills set to climb anywhere between $100 and $340. It's important to make sure your hot water system is working properly, especially the thermostat, because if it's set too high, it will add a lot to your bill. As a general rule, try not to set your heating on a split cycle too far above 20 degrees. Every degree above that mark can increase energy usage by 10%. It also pays to be across available government rebates and assistance programs.\n\nThe segment then transitions to a discussion of Qantas boosting its number of international flights. The carrier will add one million seats over the next 12 months on flights to Asia, the US, and the Pacific. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce says that the more supply they put in, the more capacity there is to meet demand and lower airfares.\n\nThe segment then transitions to a discussion of new recruits graduating from Orchard Hills. The son is joining his father on the fire front line as new recruits graduate.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Nine News\n* Fox Sports\n* PGA\n* Harvey Norman\n* Allianz Stadium\n* KFC\n* Wests Tigers\n* Steeden\n* Brydens Lawyers\n* Pepper Money\n* FAB Industrial Logistics\n* Aland\n* Rafa Nadal Academy\n* Movistar\n* BBC Sport\n* This is Yuggera and Turrbal Country\n* Goodyear Autocare\n* Optus Sport\n* Premier League\n* American Express\n* Sky Bet\n* EFL\n* beIN Sports\n* AGL\n* Canstar Blue\n* Qantas\n* NSW Fire + Rescue\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Construction site\n* News studio with a backdrop of the Sydney skyline\n* Allianz Stadium\n* Press conference at the Rafa Nadal Academy\n* Tennis court\n* Street interview\n* Home interior showing energy-saving practices\n* Airport tarmac with Qantas planes\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Sports news (Rabbito’s vs. Eels game, Jerome Luai's availability for Origin selection, Luke Brooks' future)\n* Retirement of Rafael Nadal\n* US PGA Championship\n* Energy savings\n* Qantas increasing international flights\n* Firefighter recruits graduating\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Danika Mason\n* Brad Fittler\n* Jerome Luai\n* Tim Sheens\n* Luke Brooks\n* Joe Ofahengaue\n* Rafael Nadal\n* Todd Woodbridge\n* Roger Federer\n* Novak Djokovic\n* Adam Scott\n* Tom Kim\n* Eric Cole\n* Alan Joyce\n* David Slape\n* Bruce Hardy\n* Red Butler"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12852527,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.11920304599999999},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12506537,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.24653345},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.13296436,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20434219},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.061875988,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.12085322}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1469,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178707}}}

Harrison wears a black button-down shirt and dark pants, while Bronte wears a bright blue blazer, a black mini skirt, and black knee-high boots. They both appear to be listening intently to something off-screen.\n\nThe scene then cuts to a different couple, Dan and Sandy, sitting on a navy blue couch. Dan wears a light gray button-down shirt, while Sandy wears a mustard yellow satin blouse and black leather pants. Sandy has long, dark brown hair styled in loose waves, and she wears large gold hoop earrings.  She appears serious and concerned. Dan has shorter brown hair and looks equally serious.\n\nThe scene shifts to another couple, Lyndall and Cameron, sitting on a white couch against a brick wall. Cameron wears a light beige sweater, while Lyndall wears a white button-down shirt. Lyndall has long blonde hair and wears bright red lipstick. Cameron has short brown hair and a neatly trimmed beard. He rests his chin on his hand, appearing thoughtful. Lyndall looks concerned.\n\nNext, the camera focuses on Alyssa and Duncan, sitting on a gray couch in front of a curtain. Alyssa wears a brightly colored, one-shoulder floral dress and large gold hoop earrings. Duncan has long dark hair tied in a topknot and wears a brown sweater. Alyssa has a serious expression, while Duncan appears to be listening attentively.\n\nThe scene then cuts to a leather couch where three experts sit. The woman on the left wears a purple dress, the woman in the middle wears a pink pantsuit, and the man on the right wears a black suit. The man in the black suit begins speaking, addressing the group about events that occurred the previous night at a dinner party. He mentions that Harrison went out with some people from the group and got a girl's number. He questions Harrison's actions, asking why he would take a girl's number while being married.\n\nThe camera focuses on Harrison, who explains that he just wanted the conversation to be over and didn't want any conflict. He says he felt he was being sympathetic to the girl's feelings. Alyssa, off-screen, sarcastically remarks, \"How lovely of you.\"\n\nThe expert then asks Harrison if any part of him thought that taking the girl's number would be inappropriate since he was in a relationship. Harrison admits that he did think that.\n\nThe expert then turns to Bronte and asks if Harrison's actions didn't make her question things. Bronte, initially wiping a tear from her eye, replies that she's a secure woman and knows that women will hit on Harrison because he's good-looking. She says it's human nature and that she's choosing to trust him. She adds that if she keeps having doubts, there's no point in her being there.\n\nAlyssa, off-screen, sarcastically remarks, \"I don't get it. I actually don't get it.\"\n\nThe expert in the purple dress clarifies Bronte's statement, asking if she's saying that because Harrison is considered good-looking by some people, it's not his fault. Bronte agrees, saying that at the end of the day, she has to build trust, and that's why she's there. She's choosing to trust Harrison, and if she keeps having doubts, there's no point in her being there. Alyssa, off-screen, comments that she doesn't like the situation one bit, and it makes her sick to her stomach.\n\nThe expert then asks Harrison why he didn't act on his thought that taking the girl's number was inappropriate. Harrison replies that he wanted to humor the girl and didn't want to escalate the situation.\n\nThe expert turns to Bronte and asks if she trusts Harrison at this moment. Bronte replies, \"Yeah, I do.\"\n\nThe expert then asks Harrison if he would have told Bronte about the incident if the group hadn't started talking about it. Harrison admits that he probably wouldn't have.\n\nThe expert then asks Harrison why it is wrong to get another girl's number while in a relationship. Harrison says he supposes it could be seen as a breach of trust. The expert presses him, asking what he thinks it is. Harrison says he's explained the situation. The expert acknowledges this but asks if he sees his behavior as a breach of trust. Harrison replies, \"Yes.\"\n\nThe expert then asks Bronte if she trusts Harrison. Bronte says she does.\n\nHarrison says he didn't think anything good would come from telling Bronte, and under normal circumstances, he would have told her immediately. But he feels like he's seeing the girl he met at the wedding for the first time in a long time, and he'll do whatever it takes to earn Bronte's trust.\n\nThe expert says they'll hold him to that and tells Harrison he has to do better, as there's a pattern there, and he can make a choice to do things differently.\n\nThe experts then ask Bronte and Harrison for their decision to stay or leave. Bronte says that she and Harrison have been through a lot and have made some really good progress. She's choosing to stay and learn to trust him. Harrison says he's trying and taking every day as it comes. He feels like he's seeing the girl he met at the wedding for the first time in a long time, and he'll do whatever it takes to earn Bronte's trust. Both Bronte and Harrison choose to stay.\n\nThe experts then invite Sandy and Dan to the couch. Dan recounts that the dinner party was going well until Harrison pulled him aside and told him about the conversation he had with Janelle and Adam about the night they were out. Harrison had gotten a girl's number, and Dan had done the same thing. Dan says he felt his integrity was under question, and he wanted to make it clear that the accusations were not accurate.\n\nSandy explains that she was upset because if Harrison had taken a number, it wouldn't sit well with her. She's choosing to trust Dan, and if she ends up with egg on her face, it's a lesson learned.\n\nBoth Sandy and Dan choose to stay.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\nPolo Ralph Lauren (logo on Harrison's shirt)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Living room setting with multiple couches and couples seated.\n* Experts seated on a separate leather couch.\n* Brief shots of a cityscape at night and a building exterior.\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Trust and betrayal in relationships\n* Communication and honesty\n* Personal growth and learning from mistakes\n* The challenges of navigating a new relationship\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Harrison\n* Bronte\n* Dan\n* Sandy\n* Lyndall\n* Cameron\n* Alyssa\n* Duncan\n* Janelle\n* Adam"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07263684,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.115960866},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09268759,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16667561},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.13568978,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16995595},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.25238422,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.2893713}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1487,"promptTokenCount":1293813,"totalTokenCount":1295300}}}

The scene transitions to a \"Previously on\" segment, recapping events from a reality show, likely \"Married at First Sight.\"\n\nThe first scene shows a man and woman sitting on a green couch, engaged in a serious conversation. A woman with blonde hair and silver earrings, possibly a relationship expert, questions the man about being intimate with his ex a week before joining the experiment. The man, appearing slightly uncomfortable, confirms this. Other participants react with surprise and shock.\n\nThe scene shifts to a commitment ceremony, a pivotal event in the show. The narrator describes it as the newlyweds' first commitment ceremony. A woman in a green dress reveals her decision to \"stay\" in the experiment, while her male partner chooses to \"leave.\" This unexpected turn of events leads to emotional reactions, particularly from the woman.\n\nThe focus then moves to another couple, where a woman named Alessandra is credited with helping Melissa and Josh rekindle intimacy in their relationship. The experts suggest that Melissa and Josh can learn from each other to build a strong emotional connection and a fulfilling sex life.\n\nThe next scene highlights a confrontation between a couple. The man, Jesse, is accused of overreacting to cheating allegations. He admits that the experiment has brought out the worst in him. Jesse chooses to \"leave,\" while his partner, Claire, opts to \"stay.\" This decision leads to Jesse's departure from the show.\n\nThe segment transitions to \"Alessandra's Intimacy Week,\" showcasing various couples engaging in intimate activities like massages, pillow fights, and playful interactions. The atmosphere is lighthearted and sensual.\n\nHowever, the mood shifts again as Jesse confesses to having jealousy issues. He admits to overreacting and expresses regret for his actions. The scene shows him hugging Claire, suggesting a reconciliation.\n\nThe narrative then turns to another couple facing challenges. Harrison accuses Bronte of gaslighting him. Bronte appears upset and frustrated by the accusations. The scene highlights the tension and conflict in their relationship.\n\nThe focus returns to Melissa and Josh, whose marriage is on the rocks. Melissa criticizes Josh's inability to love, leading to an emotional breakdown from Josh. He expresses doubt about continuing in the experiment.\n\nThe show's title card, \"Married at First Sight,\" appears, followed by a scenic view of Sydney's skyline and harbor. The scene then shifts to a modern apartment building, where the couples are shown navigating the aftermath of the commitment ceremony.\n\nSome couples, like Harrison and Bronte, and Lyndall and Cameron, are shown enjoying a peaceful morning, making coffee and engaging in light conversation. However, the tension from the previous night's events is palpable in other couples' interactions.\n\nJanelle and Adam discuss the revelations from the commitment ceremony, particularly Shannon's confession about still loving his ex. Janelle expresses shock and surprise at this revelation.\n\nThe focus shifts back to Shannon and Caitlin. Shannon expresses his desire to win Caitlin back and focus on their relationship. He acknowledges his past mistakes and emphasizes his commitment to Caitlin.\n\nThe segment then revisits the accusations made against Adam. Janelle expresses confusion and questions the truth behind the allegations. Adam denies the accusations and emphasizes his commitment to Janelle.\n\nThe scene moves to Jesse and Claire, who are still living separately. Jesse expresses anxiety about his recent behavior and its impact on the group. Claire reflects on Jesse's decision to leave and his admission about his jealousy. She expresses a desire for Jesse to step up and make things right.\n\nThe final scene shows Melissa and Josh attempting to move forward after their difficult conversation. Melissa expresses excitement about intimacy week and initiates a conversation about sex. Josh appears receptive to her efforts.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Tommy Hilfiger logo on a sweatshirt\n* Lacoste logo on a t-shirt\n* Louis Vuitton logo on a purse\n* New Era logo on a baseball cap\n* Raiders logo on a sweatshirt\n* Bulls logo on a baseball cap\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Dark building with lit windows (likely the apartment complex where the participants live)\n* Commitment ceremony set (a formal space with couches and lighting)\n* Various apartment interiors (showcasing the couples' living spaces)\n* Sydney skyline and harbor (establishing shot)\n* Modern apartment building exterior (establishing shot)\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Commitment and trust in relationships\n* Communication and conflict resolution\n* Jealousy and insecurity\n* Intimacy and emotional connection\n* The challenges of a social experiment\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Shannon (Personal Trainer, VIC, 30)\n* Caitlin\n* Jesse (Marriage Celebrant, WA, 30)\n* Claire (Kindergarten Assistant, VIC, 31)\n* Alessandra\n* Melissa (Hairdresser, NSW, 41)\n* Josh\n* Harrison\n* Bronte\n* Adam\n* Janelle (Beauty Influencer, WA, 28)\n* Lyndall\n* Cameron\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09268759,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.12678547},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.10818888,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15610497},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1510279,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20689407},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.36749786,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.41489893}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1078,"promptTokenCount":177234,"totalTokenCount":178312}}}

The reporter mentions that the train network is neither reliable nor resilient. An independent report attempts to explain why. The transport minister, Jo Haylen, states that the train network has been fragile since the introduction of the 2017 timetable. The report acknowledges a sudden and significant increase in the backlog when unions went to war last year, coupled with a series of freak floods. The main recommendation is for a 12-month maintenance blitz to bring the network up to scratch, but the transport minister says no more money will be allocated to repairs and no services will be cut to allow extra time on the tracks. The shadow transport minister, Natalie Ward, criticizes the government for hiding behind a six-year-old timetable change and not having a plan. The timetable is due for review next year when the opening of the new metro line through the city is expected to relieve pressure.\n\nThe next news segment is about two would-be thieves who led police on a short but destructive chase through Bradbury in Sydney's southwest. They jumped fences and fell through the roof of a shed. One tried to hide, another escaped, and tonight remains on the run. The police are after the suspect, who is hard to see in the dark. The suspect bolts into the darkness at the end of Cable Road in Bradbury. He vanishes. The police ask a resident if he saw the suspect come up this way. The resident says he doesn't know where he went. The police tell someone to get back in their car. The second suspect didn't run, he hid. After a few minutes of searching, he's eventually arrested. The chase started only ten minutes earlier when the two men allegedly tried to break into a home on nearby Callie Road around 10 last night. The woman inside dialed triple zero as the men tried to find a way in. When police arrived, they were spooked, running out the back, past a pool, and jumping onto the roof of a shed. The roof gave way. They kicked the door off and headed for the street. As police were chasing one suspect, a second was able to slip into the backyard of a property. It took several minutes until a resident spotted the intruder and called out to police. Brian McCreadie, a witness, said his son asked the suspect what he was doing there, and the suspect said he was chasing someone who broke into his house. Brian didn't buy it, pointing him out to police. Cameras captured the moment they swarmed the 31-year-old, arresting and charging him with three offenses relating to the alleged attempted break-in. His mate is still on the run.\n\nThe next news segment is about the Lehmann Inquiry. A senior police officer who investigated the Brittany Higgins rape allegations says he did not believe the evidence against Bruce Lehrmann was sufficient enough to take him to trial. Detective Inspector Scott Moller said police investigators were under significant pressure from the media to charge Mr. Lehrmann. Mr. Lehrmann has consistently denied the allegation of rape.\n\nThe next news segment is about the Voice to Parliament. There has been a fiery start to debate over a Voice to Parliament. Opposition leader Peter Dutton called it the most radical change to our democracy in history. The Prime Minister is back from a successful summit in Japan, now facing a domestic battle over the referendum. Fresh from a diplomatic dash abroad into a fight on the home front, Peter Dutton today wrapped up his attack. He said a voice would be the most radical and consequential change to the way our democracy operates in our nation's history. Labeling the referendum a reckless roll of the dice, he said the government wants people to vote for the voice on a vibe. Linda Burney, the Indigenous Affairs Minister, said they had just heard in one speech every bit of disinformation and misinformation and scare campaigns. A new ad campaign is rolling out from the Yes side. The ad says the voice will be a permanent body and it would give independent advice. As Parliament considers legislation for the words that would be added to our Constitution, Eliza Edwards, a federal politics reporter, said that while the bill enabling the referendum is contentious, it's expected to pass Parliament in coming weeks before the Prime Minister fires the starting gun on the official campaign, setting the date Australians will head to the polls. Zali Steggall, an independent MP, said we are at a really important start line as a nation of what we can be. The purpose of the voice is to improve outcomes for our people. Dorinda Cox, a Greens MP, said they want to make sure that they are standing on the right side of history.\n\nThe next news segment is about a semi-trailer mishap. A semi-trailer hauling an excavator fell onto its side at Homebush West this morning, blocking Caroly Avenue. There were traffic delays with a small fuel spill cleaned up by fire and rescue. The driver was shaken but not hurt.\n\nThe next news segment is about India PM visit. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is arriving in Sydney tonight for a much-anticipated visit. Nine's Eddy Meyer joins from Sydney Airport. He says there is lots of color and movement. Narendra Modi will arrive at the private jet base in a couple of hours. His first scheduled appearance is not until tomorrow night, an event at Sydney Olympic Park where he'll be greeted by 20,000 adoring Indian Australians. The event was oversubscribed, with people flying in from all over the country and New Zealand. He'll be greeted there by the Prime Minister, who will then hold formal talks with Mr. Modi on Wednesday morning. No one will be more excited about this visit than the residents of Sydney's own Little India at Harris Park, desperately hoping that Mr. Modi comes to visit them.\n\nThe next news segment is about Sydney weather. Amber Sherlock, the weather reporter, says winter has arrived early. Despite the winds dying down today, it was still bitterly cold under clear blue skies. Camden and Richmond dipped to zero degrees. Campbelltown, Horsley Park, and Penrith fell to a nice three degrees. Bankstown was four degrees. The city fell to eight this morning, four degrees colder than average, before reaching a top of 20 this afternoon, although it felt closer to 17 degrees thanks to those southwesterly winds. It took several hours for the west to warm up, finally reaching 21 degrees, but only briefly. It will be another chilly night tonight.\n\nThe next news segment is about a credit crackdown. Big changes to buy now, pay later. The crackdown that will change the way people shop online. It's been growing out of control. Perth mom Krystal Brown now has to use Afterpay for essentials like nappies. She says she's bankrupt, but it's one of the few lines of credit still open to her. She says she doesn't like to be dependent on many things, if anything, but Afterpay is definitely something that they can't live without at the moment. The government is worried. Buy now, pay later was never meant to be relied on like this, and the laws are too weak to keep out predators. The Albanese government is announcing that they intend to bring buy now, pay later into the National Consumer Credit Act. It will mean mandatory credit licenses for all providers, responsible lending rules, dispute resolution, and hardship options for people struggling to pay.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Nine News\n* 2GB\n* Transport Sydney Trains\n* Hope 103.2\n* Afterpay\n* Zip\n* humm\n* Klarna\n* penpay\n* PayPal\n* sezzle\n* SplitIt\n* zippay\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Sydney train station\n* Press conference room with flags\n* Train station platform\n* Train interior\n* Train replacement bus stop\n* Train tracks\n* News studio\n* Residential street at night\n* House with damaged shed\n* Street interview\n* Parliament House\n* Homebush West\n* Sydney Airport\n* Retail store\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Sydney train network reliability and resilience issues\n* Police chase and arrest of would-be thieves\n* Lehmann Inquiry and allegations of rape\n* Voice to Parliament referendum debate\n* Semi-trailer mishap causing traffic disruptions\n* Sydney weather report\n* Credit crackdown on buy now, pay later services\n* New food scrap bins in Sydney's Inner West\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Jo Haylen (Transport Minister)\n* Carolyn Walsh (National Transport Commission Chair)\n* Liz Daniels (State Politics Reporter)\n* Natalie Ward (Shadow Transport Minister)\n* Alex Heinke (Reporter)\n* Bruce Lehrmann\n* Peter Dutton (Opposition Leader)\n* Linda Burney (Indigenous Affairs Minister)\n* Eliza Edwards (Federal Politics Reporter)\n* Zali Steggall (Independent MP)\n* Dorinda Cox (Greens MP)\n* Narendra Modi (India's Prime Minister)\n* Eddy Meyer (Reporter)\n* Amber Sherlock (Weather Reporter)\n* Krystal Brown (Afterpay User)\n* Stephen Jones (Financial Services Minister)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.11920304599999999,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15203233},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.17106095,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.34775832},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.22135042,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16776322},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.10818888,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14804702}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1942,"promptTokenCount":177237,"totalTokenCount":179179}}}

She mentions analyzing her race and identifying areas for improvement, expressing her hope to implement these improvements for Paris. The scene transitions to a swimmer diving into a pool and swimming underwater. The narrator introduces Ariarne Titmus, highlighting her early understanding of her destiny and the maturity she possessed to leave her beloved home to pursue it. The video then shows Titmus winning an Olympic gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle, followed by her expressing her desire for people to know that one's origin doesn't limit their potential for achievement. She emphasizes the importance of inner drive and determination, regardless of background or access to resources.\n\nThe scene shifts to a preview of an upcoming segment titled \"In Too Deep.\" The segment focuses on Giancarlo Granda, a 20-year-old hotel pool attendant who becomes entangled in a decade-long scandal involving prominent figures in America's evangelical movement. The story involves religion, sex, and politics, and centers around Granda's encounter with Becky, a hotel guest who propositions him. The situation escalates when Becky involves her husband, Jerry Falwell Jr., in their interactions. The scandal exposes the hypocrisy of these religious leaders and the political implications of their actions.\n\nThe preview then delves into the details of Granda's encounter with Becky and Jerry Falwell Jr. at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami. Granda describes the hotel environment as fun and flirtatious, and recalls Becky taking pictures of him, which he found unusual. Their conversation leads to Becky proposing a sexual encounter, with her husband wanting to watch. Granda initially hesitates but ultimately agrees. He later expresses shock when Becky pursues further encounters and invites him on a holiday with her and her husband.\n\nThe preview emphasizes the significance of Jerry Falwell Jr.'s role in the scandal, highlighting his position as president of Liberty University, America's largest evangelical college, and his influence in conservative politics. The story is described as a bizarre drama involving a Hollywood actor and even a US president. The narrator mentions that the story is about ultimate power leading to ultimate corruption, and that Granda played a key role in exposing this corruption.\n\nThe preview then provides more details about Granda's encounter with Becky and Jerry Falwell Jr. at the Fontainebleau Hotel. It describes the encounter as a three-way tryst, and highlights the shock Granda experienced when Becky revealed her husband's desire to watch. The preview also mentions Granda's girlfriend and his increasing discomfort with the ongoing relationship with Becky and Jerry Falwell Jr. It concludes with Granda's realization of the moral hypocrisy of the couple and their connection to the Falwell family and Liberty University.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes\n* Omega\n* Oakley\n* Google\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Olympic swimming pool\n* Interview setting\n* Poolside at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami\n* Hotel room\n* Liberty University campus\n* US Capitol Building\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Achievement and overcoming adversity\n* Moral hypocrisy and corruption\n* Religion, sex, and politics\n* Power and influence\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Ariarne Titmus\n* Giancarlo Granda\n* Becky Falwell\n* Jerry Falwell Jr.\n* Jerry Falwell Sr.\n* Donald Trump\n* Dustin Wild"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20946948,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19314747},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19806427,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3090236},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.29259497,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.25386122},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.46854743,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.41347742}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":743,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":177981}}}

The segment features interviews with economists, business owners, and politicians, as well as footage of everyday Australians struggling with rising prices.\n\nThe segment begins with an economist discussing the challenges of policy management in addressing inflation. He emphasizes the need for decisive action to achieve desired outcomes. The reporter then introduces the topic of Australia's inflation rate, which is currently at a worrying 7%, despite ten interest rate hikes.\n\nThe segment then shifts to the impact of inflation on businesses, focusing on a fresh fruit provider named Steven Biviano. The price of a single head of lettuce soared to over $10 last year, and while prices have come down somewhat, the situation remains unpredictable. Biviano's nearest competitor recently went into administration, highlighting the precarious position of many businesses. He notes the fluctuating spending patterns of his clients, with high-end spending decreasing while smaller businesses and local customers are also cutting back.\n\nAn economist, Gigi Foster, from the University of New South Wales, describes the current economic climate as the most interesting of her generation. She believes Australians need to \"strap themselves in\" for a long recovery from the crisis, predicting that high prices and uncertainty will persist for years, not just months. Foster also discusses her controversial stance on COVID lockdowns, arguing that they did more harm than good. She attributes part of Australia's sluggish economy to what she perceives as laziness and complacency among Australians, urging them to \"get off their lazy couches\" and take action to avoid a recession.\n\nThe segment then turns to Switzerland, a country that has largely avoided the inflation crisis. The Swiss inflation rate is around 3%, the lowest in the Western world. The segment highlights Switzerland's stunning vistas, world-class chocolate and cheese, and stable economy. Professor George Sheldon from the University of Basel attributes Switzerland's success to its low-cost electricity market and strong niche industries. He acknowledges that the cost of living in Switzerland is also very high, but emphasizes the country's overall economic strength.\n\nThe segment concludes with a discussion of the Australian government's role in addressing the cost of living crisis. Senator Jane Hume, who is chairing a Senate committee on the issue, stresses the need for government action to tackle rising prices. She believes the government must tighten its belt in the upcoming budget to address the crisis and support struggling Australians. Economist Stephen Hamilton agrees, arguing that the time for tiptoeing around the issue of inflation is long gone. He advocates for the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates and for the treasurer to slash spending in the May budget. He acknowledges that these measures may be painful in the short term, but believes they are necessary to bring inflation under control and avoid a recession.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n60

The camera focuses on the hand as it moves along the railing. The scene then shifts to a man in a gray suit walking away from the camera on a city street. The man turns to face the camera, revealing a concerned expression. The narrator states that the man, Chris Ridgeway, profited from a questionable global financial scheme. Ridgeway made $1.6 million, but the millions more his clients invested are now missing. Ridgeway claims he doesn't know what happened to the money, but he believes others likely do.\n\nThe scene changes to a parking garage, where an older man is shown walking and carrying a shopping bag. The narrator states that Ridgeway believes David Sutton knows where the money went. The scene then cuts to Ridgeway in a different setting, wearing a blue and white checked shirt. He suggests that the interviewer ask David Sutton where the money went if they ever get the opportunity.\n\nThe scene shifts to an aerial view of a house with a pool, surrounded by trees. The narrator states that David Sutton lives in a wealthy suburb on Sydney's northern beaches. The scene then cuts to a woman, Adele Ferguson, walking towards the house. She knocks on the door but receives no answer. She then tries calling Sutton on her phone, but the call goes to voicemail. Sutton eventually responds via text message, stating that his legal advice is not to speak to the media.\n\nThe scene changes to a woman knocking on a white door of a brick house. The narrator states that they also tried to ask Sutton's business partner in England, Andy Turner, if he knew what happened to the money. Turner is seen briefly at the door, talking on his phone. The narrator states that Turner wasn't talking either, but yesterday, he sent a statement denying any wrongdoing.\n\nThe scene cuts back to Ridgeway, now walking in a park, carrying his suit jacket. He says that Sutton and Turner have hung him out to dry and have done nothing to help him. The scene then shifts to a group of people sitting around a large table in a formal room. They are discussing the missing money and express their frustration with the situation. They have no sympathy for Ridgeway and know with near certainty that their investments are worthless. They want answers about how the scheme was allowed to happen and where the money has gone.\n\nThe scene cuts back to Ridgeway, now sitting in a chair and wearing a blue and white checked shirt. He says that the intermediaries got paid a lot of commission, so they wouldn't care about the clients. He feels he's been left to take the blame while others are happy and haven't done anything to help him. The group at the table continues their discussion, expressing their frustration with the financial regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). They believe ASIC should bear some responsibility for the situation, as its role is to protect consumers. They also suggest that the directors who set up the entities they invested in are planning their next company, and they need to be stopped.\n\nFormer Senator John Williams, who has been trying to help the investors who lost their money, is a long-time critic of ASIC. He accuses it of being ineffectual. He says that ASIC is the definition of frustration and that he has spent 11 years trying to get them to act and become a fearless cop on the beat, but all for nothing. The woman at the table asks what message it sends to crooks when ASIC doesn't act. Williams responds that it tells them they can siphon off commissions, break the law, siphon money, and have no respect for the people whose money they are investing because there is no fear of punishment.\n\nThe scene cuts back to Ridgeway, walking in a covered walkway. The narrator states that after years of deceit, Ridgeway finally came clean to his clients, and even his wife and children. This was probably his only option. The narrator states that what has to be worked out now is the price he needs to pay for the enormous trail of destruction he has caused. Ridgeway is asked what he thinks will happen. He says he doesn't think he will be able to be a financial advisor again, may not be able to be a company director, and may end up being charged with fraud and going to jail. He is terrified and horrified by this prospect. He says he is sorry for his actions and didn't mean for this to happen. He just wanted them to have a good life.\n\nA woman with blonde hair and glasses, who appears to be Ridgeway's wife, is interviewed. She says she spoke to him at Christmas time and was prepared to listen to what he had to say. He told her and their children that he was sorry and wanted to fix things. She later found out he was having an affair with someone else, which was a second level of betrayal and lies. She doesn't know the answer to the question of whether she believes him. Ridgeway is asked what he would say to his wife and kids. He says he is sorry and didn't mean for this to happen. He just wanted them to have a good life. He apologizes again and says he is trying to own it and fix it.\n\nThe scene shifts to a woman with short blonde hair sitting in front of a screen displaying a picture of Ridgeway and burning money. The title \"The Confession\" is displayed on the screen. The woman summarizes the story, stating that Ridgeway's former employer, Shore and Partners, says he deliberately circumvented the company's compliance procedures to deceive them. In some welcome news for the clients, Shores says it's working to compensate the impacted parties. Last Thursday, ASIC announced it was permanently banning Ridgeway from any involvement in financial services.\n\nThe scene changes to a man in a suit and coat walking on a snowy walkway next to a river. City buildings are visible in the background. The title \"The TikToking Time Bomb\" is displayed on the screen. The man, Victor Gao, is a former diplomat and an expert in Chinese affairs. He is an unofficial mouthpiece for the communist regime. He says that many people in China consider bans on TikTok by foreign countries to be a laughingstock because it reveals their weaknesses and inferiority, rather than their strengths and superiority. He thinks this is a big loss for countries like Australia. He says that such bans should be avoided and are probably racist and discriminatory. A woman in a red suit responds that there is no suggestion of racism against the Chinese people. The concern is what the Chinese government could do with our data. Gao says that Australians need to be confident about their own system rather than being threatened by TikTok. He says that many years ago, banning Chinese was a disaster, and now they want to do it again. It will not be a success.\n\nThe scene changes to a montage of TikTok videos. A woman in a red suit sits in front of a screen displaying the Chinese flag and a TikTok video. The title \"The TikToking Time Bomb\" is displayed on the screen. The woman says that TikTok has been causing a stir lately. Last week, it was banned from Australian government phones and devices, deemed a risk to national security because of its Chinese ownership. This has upset the local arm of TikTok, who maintain their app is harmless fun, not a spy tool. It has also outraged the Chinese Communist Party, which is once again warning us not to treat Beijing as the enemy.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n60 Minutes\nTikTok\nByteDance\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\nCity street\nParking garage\nWealthy suburb on Sydney's northern beaches\nFormal meeting room\nPark\nCovered walkway\nStudio with a screen displaying \"The Confession\"\nSnowy walkway next to a river in a city\nStudio with a screen displaying \"The TikToking Time Bomb\"\nByteDance office building\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\nFinancial fraud\nMissing investments\nCorporate responsibility\nGovernment regulation\nNational security\nData privacy\nInternational relations\nRacism and discrimination\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\nChris Ridgeway\nDavid Sutton\nAdele Ferguson\nAndy Turner\nGroup of investors\nJohn Williams\nVictor Gao"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.27591002,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.21866964},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21866964,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.31153157},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.33112,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.23370646},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09401007,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.11920304599999999}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1721,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178959}}}

The scene then shifts to a boat on the water, with the sun shining brightly in the background. The camera focuses on the hands of a person steering the boat. The scene then transitions to a man in a uniform, identified as Superintendent Graeme Campbell of the Australian Border Force. He is standing on the boat and looking out at the water. The camera zooms in on the Australian Border Force logo on the side of the boat. The Australian flag is shown waving in the wind.\n\nThe scene then shifts to an interview between Superintendent Campbell and a reporter. The reporter asks Campbell about the threat posed by the cruise ship industry in Australia. Campbell responds that it is a very real threat for the importation of narcotics. He clarifies that the majority of passengers and crew are legitimate travelers, but that a very small element is trying to use the industry to import narcotics. The reporter points out that Australia is a big island and a big target, and Campbell agrees, adding that it is an attractive target for organized crime. The reporter asks if it is hard to police, and Campbell says it is very hard, but that they are pretty good at it.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a cruise ship at sea. The narrator explains that in August 2016, Campbell and his colleagues were tracking the Sea Princess as it made its way around the world. Their targets were Isabelle Lagace and Melina Roberge. The narrator explains that the two women had been identified as passengers of interest, and that one of the destinations on their itinerary was a major concern. Campbell explains that certain ports in South America are associated with the production and distribution of cocaine, and that the Sea Princess visited some of those ports. He says that this escalated the risk, because it gave the passengers access to organized crime entities who are based in high-risk countries. The reporter asks at what point along the journey they had eyes directly on the passengers, and Campbell says that they were monitoring their movements along the way.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a series of photos of Lagace and Roberge, showing them enjoying their vacation. The narrator explains that the plan was to bring cocaine from Peru to Sydney on the cruise ship. Lagace is interviewed and says that she wasn't really thinking about the consequences. The scene then shifts to photos of other passengers on the cruise, including Barry and Nerida Rowe. The narrator explains that Barry and Nerida were making the most of their port days, taking in the sights wherever they could, but that they didn't see much of Isabelle or Melina in Peru. The narrator explains that the women were certainly up to something, and that this was the most crucial part of their mission: the cocaine pickup.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a person unpacking a suitcase full of cocaine. The narrator explains that a mystery man collected the drugs, loaded them into a suitcase, smuggled it on board the Sea Princess, and later, after getting the key from Isabelle, placed it under the bed in their cabin. The narrator explains that this seems like an extraordinary lapse of security, but that Barry and Nerida weren't exactly surprised. Barry says that he can't fathom how anyone can think that they could smuggle something on board a vessel. Nerida says that they had no idea that there was other stuff getting loaded on. Lagace is interviewed and says that she was aware that Peru was the destination for the drugs, but that they weren't going to be in their cabin yet, so they just continued the trip and enjoyed the streets of Peru. She says that she had way too much to drink and was completely drunk. She remembers doing a lot of Snapchat stories, laughing, and living her best life. The narrator explains that the plan couldn't have been more straightforward: while the party girls partied, a mystery man collected the drugs, loaded them into a suitcase, smuggled it on board the Sea Princess, and later, after getting the key from Isabelle, placed it under the bed in their cabin. The narrator explains that it seems like an extraordinary lapse of security, but that Barry and Nerida weren't exactly surprised.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Barry and Nerida walking on a dock. The narrator explains that they weren't exactly surprised, but that this was the most crucial part of their mission: the cocaine pickup. The scene then shifts to a montage of photos of Lagace and Roberge on their vacation. The narrator explains that they were intent on making the most of the rest of their free holiday. Lagace is interviewed and says that it was beginning to be a bit stressful after Peru, but that she was just trying to enjoy the cruise as much as she could. The scene then shifts to a montage of photos of Lagace and Roberge on their vacation. The narrator explains that as the Sea Princess sailed closer to Australia, the operation to close in intensified, and the Australian Border Force was ready and waiting for Lagace and Roberge.\n\nThe scene then shifts to the Sea Princess arriving in Sydney. The narrator explains that no one on board could have imagined what was about to unfold. The scene then shifts to passengers disembarking the ship. The narrator explains that for most, it was the end of a nearly two-month stint at sea, the holiday of a lifetime. But for Lagace and Roberge, it was the final stop on a mission to import cocaine into Australia. The scene then shifts to a police car driving through a port. The Australian Border Force logo is shown. Superintendent Campbell is interviewed and says that they were looking to break laws, they were looking to do bad things. The scene then shifts to a person unpacking a suitcase full of cocaine. The narrator explains that the Sea Princess now had new cargo: more than $20 million of cocaine.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Lagace and Roberge partying on the cruise ship. The narrator explains that leaving Peru, you'd think the stakes would be a little bit higher for them, but rather than keep a low profile, they were intent on making the most of the rest of their free holiday. Lagace is interviewed and says that it was beginning to be a bit stressful after Peru, but that she was just trying to enjoy the cruise as much as she could. She says that she got a tattoo in Tahiti, and that the artist was amazing. She says that's the only thing she doesn't regret about the trip.\n\nThe scene then shifts to the Sea Princess arriving in Sydney. The narrator explains that as the Sea Princess sailed closer to Australia, the operation to close in intensified, and the Australian Border Force was ready and waiting for Lagace and Roberge.

The narrator explains that the Sea Princess now had new cargo: more than $20 million of cocaine.\n\nThe scene then shifts to passengers disembarking the ship. The narrator explains that no one on board could have imagined what was about to unfold. The scene then shifts to Barry and Nerida sitting on a bench. Nerida says that they were sitting in the cafe, and she looked up and thought, \"Oh, there's a dog.\" And then she looked, and then there was a heavily uniformed man attached to that dog. There was a few of them, and she went, \"Look, look.\" Oh, maybe this is normal at the end of a cruise. Then she watched them walk past and go down the corridor. Then they had friends who were in that same corridor as the girls. She came up going, \"Oh my God, they've got the girls on the floor. There's police and dogs.\" The reporter asks Barry what was going on in his head when he saw that, and Barry says that it answered a lot of questions.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Lagace being interviewed. She says that they asked them to follow them to the cabin, and then there were people with dogs. The dogs sat next to the luggage. They asked if it was her bed, she said yes, and they asked if it was her luggage, and she said yes. She didn't know the combination, so they just cut it open to find out about 30 kilograms of cocaine in her luggage. Superintendent Campbell is interviewed and says that it was obvious that they weren't really hidden. The reporter asks what the reaction from the girls was at the time. Campbell says that they were both very surprised.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Lagace being interviewed. She says that Sydney morning, people were starting to disembark the ship. She went upstairs at the buffet to eat her breakfast, and that's when the border force entered the restaurant, and she knew it was over. They were almost the only ones in the restaurant as well, so of course, she knew it was for her. The narrator explains that Isabelle's career as a cocaine courier was finished, just seven weeks after it had started. And while she and Melina had always known there was a possibility of being busted, the other passengers, like Barry and Nerida, were stunned by the presence of border force. Nerida says that they were sitting in the cafe, and she looked up and thought, \"Oh, there's a dog.\" And then she looked, and then there was a heavily uniformed man attached to that dog. There was a few of them, and she went, \"Look, look.\" Oh, maybe this is normal at the end of a cruise. Then she watched them walk past and go down the corridor.

The narrator explains that they cut it open to find about 30 kilograms of cocaine in her luggage.

He is wearing a black t-shirt, black headphones, and white shorts. The narrator mentions Jesse's extensive \"ick list\" after his previous experiment ended. Jesse then appears in a separate interview setting, wearing a black and white floral shirt. He reads from a list of his \"icks,\" which include girls addicted to their phones, social media, motivational quotes, and those who start sentences with \"Oh my god, babe.\" He also expresses dislike for \"star sign chicks.\" The scene then transitions to Jesse and his new partner, Claire, on their wedding day. They are sitting on a couch, and Claire is wearing a white strapless wedding dress. They discuss spirituality, crystals, and star signs, which Jesse internally notes as \"ick territory.\" Claire gives Jesse a small crystal as a gift.\n\nNext, Claire is shown getting ready in the bathroom, putting on makeup and tying her hair in a ponytail. She expresses the importance of her spiritual beliefs and hopes that Jesse will be open-minded. The scene changes to Jesse and Claire arriving at a crystal shop called \"The Crystal Gallery.\" Claire welcomes Jesse to the shop, and they browse the various crystals and stones. Jesse appears amused and makes faces while looking at some of the items. Claire explains the energy and colors of the crystals, while Jesse expresses his skepticism about crystals and star signs. He picks up a small, white stone and examines it. Claire tells him it's a gentle stimulating stone that grounds energy and rectifies unjust situations. Jesse acknowledges that Claire is into crystals and decides to go along with it to make her happy. They continue to look at different stones and crystals, with Claire explaining their properties. Jesse picks up a red stone and asks if it’s a worry bead. Claire explains it’s a stone of health and helps recall dreams. Jesse comments that he likes the red stone.\n\nThe scene transitions to Jesse and Claire at the counter, where Claire is looking at some sage. She explains that it's good for cleansing spaces and getting rid of bad energy. Jesse picks up a large amethyst geode and asks if it's a meteorite. Claire tells him it’s not and that they can't touch it. They continue to browse the shop, and Jesse asks if some small bottles are cologne. Claire explains that they are color readings. Jesse reflects that he doesn't feel more in touch with his spiritual side, but he feels more connected to Claire. Claire expresses that the date has been special for her and that she enjoyed seeing Jesse out of his comfort zone. They leave the shop holding hands.\n\nThe scene changes to a view of the Sydney skyline and then to a street scene. The narrator mentions that Bronte and Harrison's relationship is still at \"rock bottom\" and that they are living in separate apartments. Bronte is shown eating from a bowl on the couch in her apartment. She reflects on their dramatic start to intimacy week. Bronte and Harrison are then shown sitting on a couch during intimacy week. Harrison tells Bronte that they have been living apart for too long and that it's not a relationship. He writes \"leave\" on a piece of paper and gives it to Bronte. Bronte expresses her frustration, saying that Harrison texted her saying he wasn't leaving, yet he wrote \"leave\" on the paper. She accuses him of gaslighting her. Bronte then goes to Harrison's apartment to talk. She says she's still angry but wants to try to change and move forward. Harrison says he didn't expect to see her and that they're not in a good place. Bronte tells Harrison that his writing \"leave\" hurt her and made her feel like he wasn't there to try. She says she wants to move on and start fresh. Harrison says he appreciates that and asks if she wants to participate in the experiment. Bronte says she does and wants to really try. Harrison says he's doing the tasks without her and keeping his word. He says he's not holding anything against her and that they should move forward. Bronte and Harrison hug.\n\nThe scene changes to the show's logo and then to a cityscape with a ferry and a kayaker. The narrator mentions that intimacy week is in full bloom for the couples. Bronte and Harrison are shown meeting for Alessandra's eye-gazing task. They greet each other with a hug. Bronte says she's intrigued to see how Harrison responds to the task. Harrison says he's nervous. Bronte says they both agreed to start their foundation again with a clean slate. She says she's going to try to stay positive. Harrison says they can do it. Bronte says she knows they can. Harrison asks Bronte to hold his hand. Bronte says it's nice because she can feel the connection they had before all the drama. She compares the moment to being at school when the teacher would tell her to stop talking or be silent. Harrison says it was nice to see her. Bronte says it was nice to see him too. Harrison says he doesn't hold grudges and that he needs to see Bronte's commitment. He says Bronte says she wants the relationship and wants to make it work with him, and now he needs to see it.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\nSony, Glad, New Era, Lacoste, Levi's\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\nJesse's apartment (kitchen and interview setting)\nWedding venue (couch scene)\nThe Crystal Gallery (crystal shop)\nSydney skyline and street scene\nBronte's apartment (couch scene)\nIntimacy week couch scene\nHarrison's apartment (couch scene)\nCityscape with ferry and kayaker\nBronte and Harrison's apartment (eye-gazing task)\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\nRelationships, communication, trust, commitment, intimacy, personal growth, emotional vulnerability, conflict resolution\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\nJesse\nClaire\nBronte\nHarrison\nAlessandra"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09947014,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.09807943},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.13568978,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19806427},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1602664,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15713716},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.33458963,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3956012}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1311,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178549}}}

His professional reputation was at stake, and he felt overwhelmed by the situation. He describes texting Becky Falwell, asking her to return his dog to his family if his lifeless body was found. He expresses a desire to distance himself from the Falwells, wanting nothing to do with them at that point. He describes feeling trapped as all doors seemed to be closing on him.\n\nThe narrative shifts to the actions of the Falwells. They had warned Giancarlo that if he raised any alarm, they would portray him as an extortionist who fabricated the entire situation. However, they were unaware that Giancarlo possessed evidence to prove Becky's involvement and Jerry's complicity.\n\nGiancarlo had recorded a FaceTime call from Becky, where she boasted about their sexual encounters, with Jerry present and watching. This recording served as the \"smoking gun,\" confirming the truth of Giancarlo's claims.\n\nThe interviewer asks Giancarlo about the content of the FaceTime recording. Giancarlo describes Becky walking around her house naked, holding a glass of white wine, and pointing to various locations where they had engaged in sexual activity. He mentions the kitchen island and one of the children's bedrooms as specific examples. The interviewer confirms that Becky had sex with Giancarlo in her own children's bedrooms, to which Giancarlo responds affirmatively, acknowledging the strangeness of the situation in retrospect. He reiterates that they had sex in one of the children's rooms and in the master bedroom. Giancarlo expresses confidence that the evidence he possesses is undeniable and proves his claims.\n\nThe video then transitions to news coverage of Jerry Falwell Jr.'s resignation from Liberty University amid the scandal. The news reports highlight Falwell Jr.'s defense that everything was \"all in good fun,\" but Liberty University placed him on indefinite leave. The reports mention Giancarlo Granda's revelations in 2020, which made headlines worldwide. Falwell Jr.'s statement, describing the situation as an \"inappropriate personal relationship,\" is shown on screen.\n\nThe narrative returns to the interview with Mark Ebner, a New York Times bestselling author who has written a book about the scandal. Ebner comments on the Falwells' belief in their untouchability. He recounts a conversation with Jerry Falwell Jr. during which Falwell Jr. was being considered for a position in Trump's cabinet. Falwell Jr. reportedly told Giancarlo that it was better to be a kingmaker than a king, demonstrating his awareness of his power and its limitations.\n\nThe video shows a FaceTime call between the interviewer and Jerry Falwell Jr., where the interviewer confronts Falwell Jr. with the allegations. Falwell Jr. denies any involvement in the sexual relationship, claiming he only walked in on the couple three times after becoming aware of the situation. He denies ever taking part in any sexual activity. When asked why he would fabricate such a story, Falwell Jr. responds, \"Money.\"\n\nA few hours after the call with Jerry Falwell Jr., Becky Falwell contacted the interviewer, demanding to share her side of the story. A recording of Becky's voice message is played, in which she says she can't do a FaceTime call because she is in bed. Becky admits to her actions but questions why she is held to a different standard because her husband was the president of a university. She states that the most important thing about Christianity is that everyone makes mistakes and everyone sins, and the purpose of Jesus Christ was to forgive sinners. She then goes on to say that the whole concept of hypocrisy is \"bullshit\" because nobody is perfect. She questions why she is held to a different standard because her husband was the president of a university.\n\nMark Ebner comments on Becky Falwell's statement, pointing out that she believes Jerry forgives her, making everything alright. Ebner questions whether Jesus or God forgives her, highlighting the lack of remorse and willingness to make amends in the Falwells' behavior.\n\nThe video concludes with Giancarlo Granda reflecting on the experience, describing it as a dark chapter in his life with tough moments. He acknowledges his regrets but states that he has become a stronger person because of it. He expresses pride in exposing corruption and predatory behavior and standing up for himself. A photo of a younger Giancarlo with Becky is shown.\n\nThe program ends with Tom Steinfort, the interviewer, providing information on how to connect with 60 Minutes on social media platforms and promoting the Nine Now app for catching up on missed segments.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes (Nine Network Australia)\n* Nine Now\n* Facebook\n* Twitter\n* Instagram\n* TikTok\n* NBC News\n* CBS Evening News\n* Washington Examiner\n* Best Buy\n* Ross Dress for Less\n* T.J.

He discusses a drug bust, noting the individuals involved were very upset upon realizing the trouble they were in. The scene then shifts to show footage of law enforcement officials uncovering packages of drugs concealed within luggage and other belongings. The drugs are wrapped in plastic and hidden amongst clothes and blankets. The narrator explains that the seized drugs amounted to a third of the total haul, with the rest found in a room occupied by a Canadian man traveling with the two women. The street value of the drugs was over $20 million, making it the largest drug bust of its kind on a cruise ship.\n\nThe scene transitions to an interview with a man and woman, presumably the parents of one of the women involved in the drug bust. They recall learning about the incident through the news. The man expresses a lack of worry for his daughter, stating she did the wrong thing and was having fun without expecting to get caught. News clips from various sources flash on the screen, reporting on the two Canadian women arrested for drug smuggling. The news reports highlight the women's luxurious travels and social media documentation of their experiences.\n\nThe parents are asked if they felt worried for their daughter. The mother says she didn't, and the father says not really because she did the wrong thing. The father also notes that they were having fun and not expecting to get caught.\n\nThe video returns to footage of a prison cell door closing, symbolizing the women's imprisonment. The narrator states that Isabelle and Melina were charged with importing a commercial quantity of cocaine and faced life behind bars. This fractured their once inseparable partnership in crime. While Isabelle pleaded guilty almost immediately, Melina tried unsuccessfully to distance herself from the operation and blame her mate.\n\nIsabelle, now out of prison, reflects on her actions in an interview. She admits to knowingly engaging in illegal activity, driven by the desire for money. She acknowledges the cliché nature of her justification but emphasizes her awareness of the consequences. She expresses a desire for a normal life with friends, family, and travel, free from criminal enterprises.\n\nThe segment then shifts to a discussion about the Australian economy and the challenges posed by inflation. The narrator introduces the topic of economic snakes and ladders, using a game board analogy to illustrate the current financial climate. He mentions a small drop in inflation, a positive sign for Australians struggling financially, but cautions that the number remains too high. He warns that homeowners with mortgages will suffer even more due to rising interest rates.\n\nThe focus then turns to a young woman named Chantel Schmidt, who struggles to afford rent. She shares a TikTok video about her landlord's attempt to increase her rent by $350 a week. The narrator explains that Chantel's situation exemplifies the cost of living crisis in Australia. \n\nThe segment returns to the discussion about inflation, with an economist suggesting a quick and easy fix: raising interest rates. However, he acknowledges that this will cause further hardship for homeowners with mortgages. He emphasizes the need for Australia to accept some brutal home truths.\n\nThe economist, Stephen Hamilton, now based in the US, notes that America has experienced even worse inflation than Australia. He explains that the US Federal Reserve took early and decisive action on interest rates, which has helped bring inflation down. He suggests that Australia should follow suit, even if it means further interest rate hikes. He argues that high inflation is worse than high interest rates and that a short, sharp burst of higher interest rates is preferable to prolonged economic instability.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes (news program logo)\n* Australian Federal Police (logo and signage)\n* Australian Border Force (signage)\n* NSW Justice Corrective Services (signage)\n* Silverwater Correctional Complex (signage)\n* 9News (news channel logo)\n* Today (news program logo)\n* Stone Ridge (clothing brand logo on a bag)\n* JD (logo on shopping bags)\n* Champion (logo on a shirt)\n* TikTok (logo on a phone screen)\n\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Interview setting with a police officer\n* Footage of a drug bust and seized drugs\n* Interview setting with parents\n* News clips from various sources\n* Footage of a prison cell and prison complex\n* Interview setting with Isabelle\n* Studio setting with a news anchor and a game board analogy\n* Street scene with Chantel Schmidt\n* Interview setting with Chantel Schmidt and a reporter\n* Street scene with a reporter\n* Economist's office in the US\n* Whiteboard with economic equations\n\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Drug smuggling and its consequences\n* The impact of crime on families\n* The Australian economy and inflation\n* The cost of living crisis\n* The role of interest rates in controlling inflation\n\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Police officer (unnamed)\n* Parents of Isabelle (unnamed)\n* Isabelle Lagace\n* Melina Roberge\n* Canadian man (unnamed)\n* News anchors and reporters (unnamed)\n* Chantel Schmidt\n* Stephen Hamilton (economist)\n\n\n"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.18126312,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1778111},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20055786,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.34422323},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2494475,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.23793007},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.13568978,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17106095}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1093,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178331}}}

He is addressing a couple, Shannon and Caitlin, who are seated on a green velvet couch across from him. The room is dimly lit, with candles and decorative lights creating a warm ambiance. The man in the suit seems to be mediating a serious conversation between Shannon and Caitlin.\n\nThe man in the suit asks Shannon if he was trying to hurt Caitlin. Shannon appears stunned and speechless for a moment, his eyes wide and mouth slightly open. He then admits that he said those things to hurt her. Caitlin, a blonde woman with large hoop earrings and a yellow dress, looks down and closes her eyes briefly. Her expression is a mix of sadness and disappointment.\n\nThe man in the suit then asks Shannon to explain himself. Shannon struggles to find the words, his eyes darting around the room. He eventually says, \"I said them just to hurt her.\" Caitlin's face remains stoic, but she seems to be holding back tears.\n\nThe scene shifts to a wider shot, revealing that the conversation is taking place in a large room with several other couples seated on couches around them. They are all watching Shannon and Caitlin intently, their expressions ranging from concern to disapproval.\n\nShannon apologizes for his actions and words, acknowledging that they were disgusting and repulsive.

Shannon struggles to articulate a clear plan, offering generic solutions like buying flowers and having conversations.

Caitlin expresses her desire to be respected and treated like a human being. She points out that Shannon's apologies have not been followed by any real change in his behavior.\n\nCaitlin then says, \"You don't deserve me.\" Shannon looks down, his face filled with a mix of shame and disappointment. Caitlin continues, expressing her desire to find someone who would love and appreciate her.\n\nThe man in the suit reiterates that the decision is entirely up to Caitlin. Caitlin takes a deep breath, her eyes welling up with tears. She seems to be wrestling with a difficult decision. The scene ends with Caitlin's face filling the screen, her expression a mix of sadness and determination.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Married at First Sight logo\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* A dimly lit room with several couches arranged in a circle.\n* A close-up shot of Shannon and Caitlin on a green velvet couch.\n* A wider shot of the room, showing the other couples watching the conversation.\n* Close-up shots of the man in the suit, Shannon, Caitlin, and other couples reacting to the situation.\n* An aerial shot of a building at night.\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Relationship conflict\n* Emotional abuse\n* Accountability\n* Forgiveness\n* Second chances\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Shannon\n* Caitlin\n* Man in a black suit (relationship expert/mediator)\n* Other couples in the room (observing the situation)\n\nI hope this detailed description is helpful!

The camera focuses on her hands as she navigates the touchpad. The woman, identified as Chantel Schmidt, is a freelance writer whose rent has been increased by a substantial $700 a fortnight. She and her housemates plan to take the issue to the tenancy tribunal next month. If the tribunal cannot provide a solution, she will be forced to move out, becoming another victim of the out-of-control inflation.\n\nThe scene shifts to an interview setting, where Chantel sits at a table with a man. They discuss the concept of a \"fair go\" in Australia and whether the rent increase aligns with this principle.

The narrator says, \"Both Amy and Katrina left the church as young adults, and neither was shocked to hear of the link between the extreme sect and the tragedy on the Melbourne Freeway in 2020.\" The scene changes to a police car at the scene of a car accident. The scene changes to a group of people walking down a city street. The narrator says, \"They can understand why the trucking boss, Simon Tuteru, thought prayer would fix the drug-addicted truck driver's problems.\" The scene changes to a close-up of a man's hand. The scene changes to the woman with long brown hair. She says, \"When I heard about the news, no doubt at all. I just was like, that is bang on what they do.\" The dark-haired woman says, \"The fact that he believed in voodoo and didn't see it as someone who needed serious help doesn't surprise me at all. And yeah, he believed that what he was doing was the right thing.\" The blonde woman says, \"And instead of telling him to get help, he prayed with him and cast a spell out of him.\" The dark-haired woman says, \"For the Potter's House, that's just normal and something that they genuinely believe. In reality, I feel like anyone else would have known how to respond in that situation.\" The scene changes to a bald man looking out a window. The blonde woman asks, \"Do you feel some remorse, even guilt, when you do hear these stories that occurred when you were the leader of the church?\" The scene changes to the bald man sitting in a chair. He says, \"Absolutely. And you know, the first couple of years that I came out of the Potter's House, every time I saw an ex-member, I just began the conversation with an apology. I was certainly never apologizing for any of the extreme acts that you've you've mentioned. But you know, I recognized I was a part of it. And I'd been there since I was 19 years old, grew up in it, got very used to it. I just didn't see the errors and the extreme that were there.\" The blonde woman asks, \"What's your message for pastors in the Potter's House now?\" The bald man responds, \"My my word to the Potter's House leaders would be rejoin the mainstream Christian church, allow them to bring that community correction in areas where they've overbalanced or gone into extreme. Allow those outside voices that will bring them back before anything else really serious happens.\" The scene changes to a group of people on a stage holding up money. The narrator says, \"When Potter's House senior member Simon Tuteru chose to pray for his exhausted truck driver and advised him to get back behind the wheel, four police officers lost their lives.\" The scene changes to four photographs of police officers. The scene changes to Simon Tuteru walking down a city street. The narrator says, \"Three months after the tragedy, Victoria Police charged Tuteru with four counts of manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty, and a trial date was set. But in October last year, inexplicably, the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions dropped all the charges.\" The scene changes to Simon Tuteru walking through a parking lot. The scene changes to Simon Tuteru walking through the rows of chairs in a church. The narrator says, \"These days, Simon Tuteru is no longer a pastor, but he is still a senior member of the church. When we contacted him, he refused to tell us anything about what happened on that terrible afternoon three years ago.\" The scene changes to a police car at the scene of a car accident. The scene changes to an aerial view of the Potter's House Church. The scene changes to a man with a long white beard sitting on a couch with the blonde woman. The blonde woman asks, \"How does it feel then knowing that Simon Tuteru is a free man? He's still attending church, he's getting on with his life.\" The man responds, \"Frustrated that he is, frustrated he's not faced court for anything. And it riles to to anger almost. That's how it feels. Shouldn't have happened.\" The blonde woman says, \"So justice for you now means everyone who had a role.\" The man responds, \"Yes. They all need to have justice.\" The blonde woman says, \"Kevin, Josh, and Glenn and Lenette and their families all need to have closure.\" The man says, \"They all need to have justice.\" The blonde woman says, \"There's three levels of blame. The driver of the truck, Tuteru, he was the manager. If Potter's House is what influenced Tuteru to make those decisions to make single drive back on the road, they're to blame as well.\" The blonde woman says, \"So justice for you now means everyone who had a role.\" The man says, \"Yes. They all need to have justice. Kevin, Josh, and Glenn and Lenette and their families all need to have closure.\" The blonde woman says, \"There's no dispute. Hugh Sheridan is one of the nicest people you could ever meet. On screen and in the theater, he is also one of Australia's finest and most loved actors. So how does anyone make sense of this? In 2020, he became the target of a vile hate campaign that almost broke him.

A woman reaches out to pet one of the horses. The narrator mentions that the family moved to Queensland so their daughter, Ariarne Titmus, could chase her dream of becoming an Olympic swimmer. Her younger sister, Mia, was twelve at the time of the move. Mia recalls telling her friends that she was leaving in four weeks and that she had a big group of friends, so it was hard to leave. Ariarne pets a horse. The narrator says that Ariarne’s father, Steve, said that if Ariarne wanted to chase her dream of being an Olympic swimmer, it wasn’t a matter of sitting around in Tasmania and waiting for what might come in the future. They had to make a decision quickly. Ariarne pets a white horse. The narrator says that the family packed up their lives and moved to Queensland, the state that produces more Olympic swimmers than anywhere else in Australia. Ariarne and Mia pet a horse together. The narrator says that the reality hit the family. The mother, Robyn, says that it was all good to say it, but then they had to think about work opportunities. She looks back and thinks that they took a chance. The title card for the segment, “Will to Win,” appears on screen.\n\nThe scene changes to a kitchen. Mia and Ariarne are making breakfast. Their father, Steve, walks in. Mia asks Ariarne if she bought the cereal for herself. Ariarne says that she did. The narrator says that it’s breakfast time in the Titmus family home in Brisbane, and sisters Ariarne and Mia are in the middle of a battle over food. Mia asks Steve if he finished off her milk. Steve says that he only used a little bit. The narrator says that eight years ago, after moving from Tasmania, it’s here in Queensland where the real fight began for Ariarne.\n\nThe scene changes to a swimming pool. Ariarne is in the pool with her coach, Dean Boxall. The narrator says that Ariarne began training with her new coach, Dean Boxall, a man now known worldwide as excitable and unpredictable. A clip of Dean Boxall celebrating Ariarne’s win at the Olympics plays. The narrator says that when Dean Boxall took Ariarne on, he knew there was a lot of work ahead. At fifty-four kilograms, Ariarne didn’t look like a swimmer and had never been to the gym. The narrator says that out-of-pool training became just as important, with Ariarne turning into a gym junkie, building muscle and strength, transforming her body. Ariarne is shown doing pull-ups and push-ups in the gym. Her father, Steve, is shown pushing a sled in the gym. Ariarne pulls a sled attached to Steve’s waist. The narrator says that Ariarne knew only a warrior could beat five-time Olympic legend, American Katie Ledecky, widely regarded as the greatest female swimmer of all time. Ariarne is shown swimming. The narrator says that back then, it was an impossible dream, because in the four-hundred-meter freestyle, Ariarne was a massive sixteen seconds slower. A clip of Katie Ledecky swimming plays.

An interviewer asks Dean Boxall if he had any idea that the fourteen-year-old he saw in 2015 was training by herself in a public pool in Launceston. Dean Boxall says that he didn’t know of that at the time, but it’s become like an urban legend. They heard stories of the Tasmanian girl because she beat one of his swimmers to make the junior team. He was watching closely down there. He watched and he saw. The interviewer says that he saw something in her. Dean Boxall says that she wasn’t the most talented. She was so far behind in turns, skills, and dives, but she was a dog. She wouldn’t let go. She could take critique. Not other people can take critique.

Melissa expresses concern about the lack of intimacy in their relationship, stating that it's a significant part of how she loves. She feels they don't have any intimacy and it scares her.\n\nMelissa emphasizes that she feels \"a hundred million billion trillion percent\" that Josh has an intimacy issue. She feels confused and like she's walking on eggshells when she talks to him. She points out that Josh complains about wanting an emotional connection, but he doesn't let her in. She demands to know how he shows intimacy without sex, questioning how they can move past this issue.\n\nJosh asks if he's supposed to wake up every day, have sex with Melissa, and comment on how good the day is.

The scene transitions to a close-up shot of the same woman, now seated in a different location, likely a studio or interview setting. She is speaking about a \"paper profit\" that seemed \"too good to be true.\" She mentions receiving reports on the value of shares, which kept her and others involved \"quiet.\"\n\nAnother woman, with shoulder-length blonde hair, is then shown in a similar interview setting. She asks the first woman about the details of the alleged profit, specifically what was being told to them about the increase in value. The first woman responds, stating that the initial investment of $40,000 was projected to grow to $1.6 million or $1.5 million at its highest point.\n\nThe scene shifts to a person flipping through documents in a binder. The documents appear to be professional reports or financial statements, containing graphs, tables, and text. The scene then transitions to two individuals seated in armchairs, examining these documents. The man, wearing a checkered shirt, points to something in the documents while the woman in the red blazer listens attentively.\n\nThe narrator explains that these \"good quality documents\" with \"lots of detail\" misled unsuspecting clients. The narrator further mentions that the stocks they were assured were about to list never did, rendering their investments worthless. The man in the checkered shirt is identified as Chris Ridgeway, and the narrator describes him as a senior advisor and stockbroker who breached trust by selling worthless products to investors and stringing them along for years.\n\nThe scene shifts to Chris Ridgeway walking down a city street. He is wearing a suit and tie. The camera follows him as he walks towards a building labeled \"Exchange Square.\" The narrator explains that in the world of financial services, trust is everything. The scene then cuts to Ridgeway sitting at a computer, looking at stock market data displayed on a screen. The narrator states that Ridgeway is now offering a \"groveling mea culpa\" before authorities knock on his door.\n\nBack in the interview setting, the woman in the red blazer asks Ridgeway if he understands that he has hurt a lot of people. Ridgeway responds affirmatively and expresses remorse.\n\nThe scene transitions to a family scene: a yellow car pulls into a driveway, and children run to greet their father. The narrator explains that the monetary damage caused by Ridgeway can be counted in millions, but the emotional harm is immeasurable. The family is identified as Darren and Kim Walker, and their two children. The narrator states that Ridgeway's actions put an end to their marriage. Although now divorced, the couple remains united in their determination to expose Ridgeway.\n\nThe scene returns to the interview setting, where Darren and Kim Walker are seated together. They express how their life was \"on hold for years\" due to the impact of Ridgeway's actions on their marriage and children. The narrator explains that the Walkers' ordeal began eight years ago when they invested $200,000 in financial products recommended by Ridgeway. He had given them an early tip on a stock about to be listed on an international exchange, assuring them they would make a lot of money. However, eight years later, the stock still hasn't been listed.\n\nThe scene cuts to Darren Walker sitting at a computer, seemingly researching information. The narrator explains that Darren's detective work was complicated and exhaustive. He discovered that one of the companies he had invested in, which was supposed to list but didn't, had been making extraordinary boasts without any backup. Darren realized that something was not right and started digging deeper.\n\nThe scene shifts to Darren driving a car. He is talking on the phone, likely to Jason Hermann. The narrator explains that as it became clear to Darren and Kim Walker that their money was gone, they also realized they were far from alone.\n\nJason Hermann is then shown in an interview setting. He expresses the immense suffering he and his family have endured, emphasizing that no amount of money can replace the emotional stress and the damage to their family. The scene cuts to Jason playing with his young son in their backyard. The narrator explains that back in 2015, Jason had made the decision to give up motorcycle racing to spend more time with his family. However, he made a dreadful decision by asking his racing mate, Ridgeway, for advice about wealth creation.\n\nRidgeway's pitch to Jason was slick and full of promise, offering to buy shares at a discounted price before the stock was listed. Jason, unaware of Ridgeway's scheme, invested $200,000. Initially, it seemed like a good investment, but as time passed, he realized his shares were worthless because the stock was never listed.\n\nEarly last year, Jason, fed up with Ridgeway's lies and excuses, gave him an ultimatum: pay back the money or he would complain to Ridgeway's bosses at Shaw and Partners. Ridgeway panicked and tried to convince Jason not to complain. However, Jason ran out of patience and filed an official complaint to Shaw and Partners. He described the situation as a \"significant crime.\"\n\nThe scene cuts to Ridgeway walking down a city street, looking distressed. The narrator states that Ridgeway's scam was finally exposed, along with the true extent of his greed. He had ripped off not only his clients but also his wife and children. A woman, Ridgeway's wife, is shown sitting on a park bench, looking distraught. She expresses her desire to see Ridgeway stop hiding and lying.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n60 Minutes, Shaw and Partners, an EFG company, ASX, Porsche\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\nKitchen, Interview setting, Office with documents, City street, Exchange Square building, Family home driveway, Family backyard, Office with computers, Car interior, Park bench\n\n**KeyThemes**\nFinancial scam, Betrayal of trust, Emotional impact of financial loss, Greed, Exposure of wrongdoing\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\nUnnamed woman (investor), Unnamed woman (interviewer), Chris Ridgeway (senior advisor and stockbroker), Darren Walker (investor), Kim Walker (investor), Jason Hermann (investor), Andy Turner (alleged co-conspirator), David Sutton (alleged co-conspirator)\n"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.16132025,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15817478},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21866964,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.28776747},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20434219,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1530423},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09268759,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13660881}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1350,"promptTokenCount":801752,"totalTokenCount":803102}}}

She says that she can definitely get ready to spice things up a bit.

She says she doesn't want to be in a relationship with him and that she needs to be assertive and hold him accountable.\n\nThe scene changes to a group of people arriving at a commitment ceremony. The hosts greet the couples, and the couples take their seats. The host, John, talks about how the moments during the experiment are incredibly important to their overall progress. He says that each time they sit with the hosts, it will get harder, they will ask more important questions, they will dig deeper, and they will get to the bottom of what is going on in their relationships. He says that no one is going to get away from this commitment ceremony without taking accountability, and that what they saw last night at the dinner party was very polarizing. He says that tonight, they will get to the bottom of things and absolutely look at their behavior in great detail.\n\nThe first couple called up is Jesse and Claire. The hosts ask them about their transformation, and Claire says that she really likes what Jesse said earlier in the experiment. She says that he told her she needs to take charge and be herself, and that she resented him for that. She says she does do that, and that there have been moments throughout the week where she normally wouldn't have said anything, but she forced herself to contribute. John says that they are now seeing their true, authentic selves. He asks Jesse how he would describe the feelings he's starting to develop for Claire, and Jesse says he likes her. Claire says she's enjoying being in Jesse's company, their humor, and the connection they have built. She says she's excited for the week ahead. The hosts ask if they've kissed, and Claire says not yet. They ask why not, and Claire says she's physically attracted to Jesse. Jesse says he's physically attracted to Claire. The hosts say they love the enthusiasm and that the anticipation is building. They tell the couple to have a great week, and the couple leaves.\n\nThe next couple called up is Bronte and Harrison. Bronte says it's been an interesting week and a bit of a 180 for both of them. Harrison says that on the back of the last commitment ceremony, things weren't great for them. He says that Bronte came and apologized and made amends, and that was an opportunity for him to show acceptance and forgiveness to her.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\nRalph Lauren\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Couch in an apartment\n* Building with arched windows\n* Apartment with ironing board\n* Commitment ceremony set\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Relationship difficulties\n* Assertiveness and accountability\n* Commitment and forgiveness\n* Physical attraction\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Caitlin\n* Shannon\n* Jesse\n* Claire\n* Bronte\n* Harrison\n* John (host)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09534948,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.11920304599999999},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.115960866,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16995595},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.117572024,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17328803},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.43974787,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.41869718}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":856,"promptTokenCount":177237,"totalTokenCount":178093}}}

It then transitions to Hugh Sheridan, an actor who has been the subject of intense speculation about his personal life. The video shows Sheridan performing on stage, struggling with his personal identity, and ultimately deciding to share his story.\n\nThe interviewer mentions that actors, by nature, are often experts at hiding who they really are, and Hugh Sheridan has been no exception. However, intense speculation about his personal life has caused him to rethink and pull back the curtain on the real Hugh.\n\nSheridan is interviewed while walking down a staircase with the interviewer. He recalls that he always enjoyed when other actors, who were past students, would come back and tell them about what it's like in the real world. He mentions that he was a student at Sydney's famed acting school, NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art), when he first discovered that he was not only attracted to women, but also liked men. Back then, he was advised to keep it quiet, otherwise his career would suffer. He recalls two teachers taking him into an office and telling him that he wasn't allowed to tell anyone, and that he would never get any work. He mentions that both of those teachers were openly gay themselves.\n\nThe interviewer clarifies that Hugh's sexuality was actually more fluid than everyone thought. Not long after his first male relationship ended, he started dating a woman again. Sheridan affirms that everyone who knows him knows who he is, and knows that he's been with guys and then has confused them and crossed the train tracks at times. They knew where he was, and he thought that maybe he should just tell his story.\n\nThe video then shows a magazine cover featuring Hugh Sheridan with the headline \"Packed To The Rafters' Hugh Sheridan addresses rumours about sexuality.\" The text on the cover reads: \"In a powerful essay and his most honest interview yet, actor Hugh Sheridan is for the first time openly addressing why he never engaged the media despite years of rumours and gossip about his personal life and sexuality – until now.\"\n\nThe interviewer asks Sheridan what he was declaring in his essay and what he was saying. Sheridan replies that he was declaring that you don't need to know all the answers. He said that in the essay, he still doesn't know the answers to a lot of things, but that was fine with him.\n\nThe interviewer points out that in his writings, Sheridan did put a label on himself. Sheridan replies that he did put the label \"Hugh\" on himself. But if she was referring to the other one, he was too scared to clear that up. He was away at the time, overseas, and he remembers waking up to all these headlines saying that he was non-binary. Then he was given pronouns of they/them, which he'd never given to himself. But the truth is, he identifies as he/him, and as human, like he said in the essay, he never said that he was non-binary. But someone else said it, and he just thought he'd let them call him whatever they want.\n\nThe interviewer asks why it was important for Sheridan to say he was bisexual. Sheridan replies that it was another label. He said that he liked both men and women, but he felt that it was important to just be honest in that article and sort of say how he felt, because that was true. He mentions that there are so many new labels now, and he said in the article that there still doesn't seem to be one that he just goes, \"Oh, that sounds like me.\" He thinks that one of the things about being human that makes us special is that we can change our minds.\n\nDespite Hugh's openness now, he has always believed he has a right to privacy, something that he closely guarded, including his long-term marriage to Rafael Dela Fuente. The interviewer asks if Sheridan was married. Sheridan replies that he was, for nine years. The interviewer points out that the marriage was in secret. Sheridan replies that it's funny, because that story broke when he got engaged to someone else. He doesn't know, actually, it was on the front page of one of those magazines, and a few people said, \"Oh, can you believe they're writing this about you?\" and he thought, \"Well, that one was true.\" Out of all things, he was married. He'd been engaged before that as well, so it just didn't seem like something that needed to be talked about. And he never felt like he was lying or being secretive. It just didn't feel to him that it was something that needed to be public.\n\nThe interviewer clarifies that Sheridan's secrecy was about it being none of anyone's business, as opposed to shame. Sheridan agrees, saying that it wasn't ever to do with shame. And when he was married and also in relationships prior to that, with both sexes, it was often about them as well, and making sure that they had privacy. Not everyone wants to be dragged into the spotlight.\n\nIronically, Hugh's essay calling for equality and understanding for all people was published just a week before the controversy of his role in the play Hedwig and the Angry Inch. But the mark of Hugh Sheridan is that he's never been a hater, unlike the people who worked so hard to cancel him.\n\nThe interviewer asks Sheridan if it's ever acceptable to sacrifice someone, to have them canceled for a bigger political point. Sheridan replies that there are things that people do that are not acceptable, specifically going out of your way to try and hurt someone or to segregate people or cast people aside. But he thinks that the question that they're talking about goes a lot further in with acting. People play Adolf Hitler, people play terrorists, people play different characters. That doesn't mean that they are those people, but they have to do it to tell the story. And so, it gets into an area where who should be allowed to tell a story. Like, if you don't have children, can you play a mother? If you haven't lost a child, can you play a mother that loses one? Could you play a widow if you're not lost your spouse? That sort of thing. He would like to see more transgender people being able to play the genders that they transition to, rather than have to play someone that's transgender.\n\nHugh Sheridan believed he had won and was then cruelly denied a once-in-a-lifetime role. He thought he would never again be offered such a demanding part. But he was wrong. He's now appearing in Tick, Tick... Boom!, landing a character just as challenging as Hedwig. It's a role that signals not the end, but the beginning of the rest of his brilliant career.\n\nThe interviewer asks if Tick, Tick... Boom! was Sheridan's silver lining to being canceled. Sheridan replies that Tick, Tick... Boom! is just a joy for him. What he really loves about this story is that it's about determination and courage to keep going. And he gets to tell that story every day, even though it can be tough from time to time, and even though people might try and bring you down from time to time. What a way to spend the day.\n\nThe segment concludes with the interviewer, Tara Brown, signing off and providing contact information for Lifeline, a crisis support and suicide prevention service. She then promotes the 60 Minutes social media pages and the 9Now streaming service.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes (news program logo)\n* NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art) (signage and banner)\n* Stellar Magazine (magazine cover)\n* Lifeline (logo and phone number)\n* 9Now (streaming service logo)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Stage performance with Hugh Sheridan singing and interacting with the band\n* Interview setting with Hugh Sheridan and the interviewer walking down a staircase\n* Interview setting with Hugh Sheridan and the interviewer sitting in a room\n* Magazine cover featuring Hugh Sheridan\n* Various images of Hugh Sheridan in different roles and settings\n* Stage performance of Tick, Tick...

The narrator states that Anne is legally responsible for the mess. She sought help from the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) but received no assistance. The camera then shows two signs on the fence, one reading \"DANGER DEEP EXCAVATION\" and the other \"DANGER CONSTRUCTION SITE UNAUTHORISED PERSONS KEEP OUT.\"\n\nThe scene transitions to the entrance of the VBA building, with glass doors and the VBA logo. Anne explains that she provided evidence, including photos, to the VBA, but they did not come out or take any action. The camera focuses on the VBA sign outside the building.\n\nIn an interview setting, a woman with blonde hair wearing a blue blazer asks another woman with dark hair and glasses wearing a green top if, in her experience, the VBA was even worth existing. The woman with glasses responds that she doesn't know the VBA's purpose and that it's costing taxpayers money to keep them employed, seemingly looking at the issue but doing nothing. The blonde-haired woman asks if she thinks if the VBA did their job, she would be going through this \"hell.\" The woman with glasses firmly replies, \"Definitely not.\"\n\nThe scene shifts to the woman with glasses standing by a window, looking out at the city. The narrator mentions that she lodged 14 complaints with the VBA over three years, but they stonewalled her. The VBA considers the case closed, but Anne is financially and emotionally destroyed, her life savings gone.\n\nThe scene changes to a woman with blonde hair and glasses standing by a wall. The narrator introduces Tamara Ralton-Stewart, whose house looks complete but is facing a second round of building issues, with an enormous bill. The first attempt at building her home was a disaster, requiring demolition and rebuilding by a new builder, leaving Tamara financially crippled.\n\nTamara recalls signing the sale of contract, believing she was realizing the Australian dream of owning a home. However, six weeks after a photo of her with her partner was taken, her elation turned to despair. The house had a hole in the roof where the drainpipe should be, causing flooding. This was just the beginning of the neglect and numerous defects. The builder, Shangri-La Constructions, threatened Tamara when she confronted them about the issues.\n\nTamara recounts the builder telling her to take them to court if she wanted the defects fixed. She realized she was in for a fight but didn't expect it to cost millions of dollars. The scene shows photos of Tamara's damaged apartment, including water damage and toxic black mold. The cladding was also a fire risk, making the building one of the most dangerous in the state. Tamara's daughter was diagnosed with asthma as a direct result of the mold. Tamara expresses her heartbreak as a mother.\n\nThe scene transitions to the exterior of Tamara's apartment building, covered in black tarps and scaffolding. The narrator explains that the building had to be demolished and rebuilt by a new builder. Tamara mentions that two of the most dangerous defects were the water damage and the flammable EPS cladding. She describes the EPS as similar to the polystyrene found in TV packaging.\n\nThe scene shifts to Tamara's daughter riding a toy tricycle in the apartment. Tamara mentions her daughter's asthma diagnosis and expresses her heartbreak. She reveals that the decision to demolish and rebuild the apartment was made in late 2020. Tamara had to pay for alternative accommodation and a $2.1 million strata loan, costing $200,000 a year in interest.\n\nTamara and other owners in her block refused to give up. They paid for independent reports to prove to the VBA that their building was a disaster. The scene shows Tamara pinning documents and photos to a corkboard, highlighting water damage, mold, structural issues, fire hazards, and building defects reports. She confirms that the VBA has all these reports, costing over $100,000.\n\nIn 2020, the VBA confirmed receiving the reports. After Tamara repeatedly questioned why Shangri-La was still operating, she received an astonishing admission of incompetence from the VBA. They had lost all but one of the reports. Tamara expresses her devastation.\n\nThe scene shows Tamara and her daughter on a playground slide. Tamara laments the lack of protection for homeowners despite the Australian dream of owning a property. She feels terrified that no one is doing their job. The scene shows the damaged building, with crumbling concrete and exposed rusty metal. A man in a hard hat explains that the foam used in the building is illegal and dangerous, posing a fire hazard.\n\nThe VBA eventually took action against Shangri-La, imposing a small fine and a three-month suspension, which was overturned on appeal. The company went into liquidation, but some family members continue to build under another name, SLC Bayside. An elderly man in a blue shirt and tie expresses his disbelief that more consumers haven't been pushed to the brink.\n\nThe scene changes to a woman with blonde hair and bangs walking through a market. The narrator mentions that it's no surprise the VBA is failing and bad builders are getting away with it. The watchdog's own inspectors claim they've been pressured to cut corners to meet unrealistic and dangerous targets. This pressure has had fatal consequences.\n\nThe scene transitions to a man in a wetsuit giving a thumbs-up in the ocean. The narrator introduces Rob Karkut, a VBA inspector who took his own life 12 months ago. His widow, Andrea Holden, is haunted by the stress in Rob's voice. She recalls Rob telling a motel owner about a bathroom problem during a holiday in the USA. The owner dismissed Rob, telling him he was on holiday and didn't need to do inspections.\n\nAndrea describes Rob as having a big personality and being full of life. He loved his job and didn't want to be anything else. She recalls the stress Rob experienced, saying he wasn't coping and that he felt like he was going to war every day. Andrea finds it unforgivable and unfair.\n\nRob, along with 40 highly skilled building and plumbing inspectors, was employed by the watchdog to identify non-compliant work on building sites. VBA management was more concerned with appearing to do the right thing than actually doing it. This left inspectors in the impossible position of not being able to do their jobs properly.\n\nThe scene shows construction workers on a building site. The narrator explains that inspectors were pressured to complete around 60 inspections a month, regardless of the faults they found. This pressure came after the Victorian government ordered the VBA to increase inspections of new buildings in 2020.\n\nIn an interview, Premier Daniel Andrews is asked about builders living up to standards and ensuring good products. He agrees but doesn't explicitly confirm if the VBA is broken.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Victorian Building Authority (VBA)\n* 60 Minutes\n* Century 21\n* YANMAR\n* ORITEK\n* Simonds\n* News First\n* 7 News\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Construction site with a wooden fence\n* Entrance of the VBA building\n* Interview setting with two women\n* Woman looking out a window\n* Woman standing by a wall\n* Damaged apartment with water damage and mold\n* Exterior of an apartment building with scaffolding and tarps\n* Interior of an apartment with a child on a tricycle\n* Corkboard with documents and photos\n* Playground slide with a woman and child\n* Damaged building with crumbling concrete\n* Man in a hard hat holding a piece of foam\n* Market with people shopping\n* Man in a wetsuit in the ocean\n* Couple in a swimming pool\n* Couple posing for a photo at the Grand Canyon\n* Couple on a beach\n* Man drinking a cocktail in an outdoor shower\n* Aerial view of a housing development\n* Construction workers on a building site\n* Premier Daniel Andrews giving a press conference\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Failure of the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) to protect homeowners\n* Negligence and threats by builders\n* Financial and emotional distress of homeowners\n* Pressure on VBA inspectors to meet unrealistic targets\n* Fatal consequences of workplace stress\n* Need for government intervention and reform in the building industry\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Anne (homeowner)\n* Tamara Ralton-Stewart (homeowner)\n* Premier Daniel Andrews\n* Rob Karkut (VBA inspector)\n* Andrea Holden (Rob Karkut's widow)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.18832432,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16451685},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19436789,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.2893713},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.25832576,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14511564},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08389048,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.150029}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1827,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":179065}}}

Here's a detailed description of the video from 1200 seconds (20:00) to 1800 seconds (30:00):\n\n**Category**\nNews\n\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\n\nThe news segment begins with a female police officer discussing a revolver. The scene transitions to grainy security camera footage showing a man, identified as Wilson, walking away from a crash scene. Police officers can be seen around a damaged car. Another scene shows police officers standing near a brick wall.\n\nA reporter, James Wilson, appears on screen, reporting from a street lined with parked cars. He states that once Wilson's matters are wrapped up in New South Wales, Queensland police will apply for his extradition. In Queensland, Wilson will face more charges for alleged offending. A mugshot of Wilson is displayed.\n\nThe news anchor, a woman in a pink blazer, introduces the next story about soccer chaos. Footage shows a clash between fans, players, and families at a Europa League soccer semifinal in the Netherlands. West Ham players intervened when their friends and family were attacked by rival supporters who broke through a fence.\n\nThe anchor then reports on a clash between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and a photo agency. The couple demanded the agency hand over its images after an alleged paparazzi chase in New York. The agency's lawyers refused, stating that property belongs to the owner and third parties cannot demand it. Footage shows Harry and Meghan in a taxi with their security detail.\n\nThe next segment focuses on luxury living. The anchor introduces a story about a family mansion in Middle Dural that is set to break records. Aerial footage of the mansion shows a pool, tennis court, and expansive grounds. Interior shots reveal luxurious bedrooms, bathrooms, a wellness retreat, cinema, and a kitchen. The homeowner, Martina Jutrisa, is interviewed in the living room, discussing the design of the home. She highlights the cathedral ceilings, stone fireplace, and herringbone timber floors. The real estate agent, William Brush, predicts the property will set a record for the area when it sells. Despite interest rate rises, luxury listings like this have bucked the trend, outperforming the rest of the market. CoreLogic's Tim Lawless explains that Sydney's premium housing market has increased in value by 4% in the past three months, with similar trends in Dural, Kenthurst, Mount Vernon, and Bringelly.\n\nThe news anchor then introduces a story about a home invasion near Brisbane. Security camera footage shows three intruders entering a house and ransacking it. The homeowner's brother comes through the back door to defend the property and is attacked with a knife. The intruders flee in a stolen getaway car. A witness, Brett Huxstep, describes the incident and the victim's injuries. The injured man was taken to the hospital for surgery. Police are using the footage to search for the culprits.\n\nThe anchor reports on the son of former New South Wales Liberal leader Kerry Chikarovski being charged over an alleged multi-million dollar drug operation. Mark Chikarovski is accused of running a dark web marketplace, selling drugs to customers and delivering them by post. Police raided his $11 million Vaucluse mansion and seized drugs, computers, cash, cryptocurrency, and two Porsches. Chikarovski was granted bail for $500,000. His mother, Kerry Chikarovski, campaigned against drugs in the 1990s.\n\nThe anchor then introduces a story about a new medication showing promising results in a trial for alopecia, a hair loss condition. The medication led to hair regrowth in a vast majority of the 700 patients in the trial, with 31% experiencing full regrowth. A patient, Kate Berger, shares her experience with the medication.\n\nFinally, the anchor reports on Campbelltown's transformation into a bustling southwest city. Stakeholders are meeting to map out a plan for more jobs and high rises to meet the demands of a booming population. The MacArthur Gardens Campbelltown project will include 1200 apartments, with 140 set aside for affordable rental. Other major projects include the redevelopment of the derelict Brands on Sale mall, an eight-story commercial building, and the $42 million Billabong Parklands. The report identifies manufacturing and healthcare as major growth industries. The Campbelltown Hospital is in the middle of a $634 million redevelopment, creating thousands of jobs for the region. A key recommendation in the report is to boost the supply of well-connected units. Two-thirds of residents currently leave the area for work.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Nine News\n* GANT\n* Europa League\n* West Ham\n* Backgrid\n* Toyota\n* LJ Hooker\n* CoreLogic\n* Panasonic\n* Qantas\n* Ford\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Street with parked cars\n* Mugshot of Wilson\n* Soccer stadium in the Netherlands\n* Taxi in New York\n* Mansion in Middle Dural\n* Living room with fireplace and bookshelves\n* Kitchen\n* Home in Logan, Queensland\n* Waverley Court House\n* Hospital in Campbelltown\n* Campbelltown, New South Wales\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Crime: Arrest of Wilson, home invasion, drug operation\n* Sports: Soccer fan violence\n* Celebrity news: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle vs. paparazzi\n* Real estate: Luxury living, booming property market\n* Health: Alopecia trial\n* Urban development: Campbelltown's future\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Wilson (suspect)\n* James Wilson (reporter)\n* Prince Harry\n* Meghan Markle\n* Martina Jutrisa (homeowner)\n* William Brush (real estate agent)\n* Tim Lawless (CoreLogic)\n* Brett Huxstep (witness)\n* Kerry Chikarovski (former politician)\n* Mark Chikarovski (son of Kerry Chikarovski)\n* Kate Berger (alopecia patient)\n* Alexander Wendler (Landcom CEO)\n* Eamon Waterford (Committee for Sydney CEO)\n* George Greiss (Campbelltown Mayor)\n* Elizabeth Bryan (reporter)\n* Bianca Balzer (reporter)\n* Josh Bavas (reporter)\n\nLet me know if you need any further clarification or have more questions."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12592298,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.150029},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.30819002,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.37662333},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.16667561,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1778111},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12085322,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13296436}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1313,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178551}}}

Alessandra holds a pink sex toy, initiating a conversation about its use and the associated taboos. A woman in a peach-colored t-shirt expresses that her Mormon upbringing makes the topic of sex toys particularly sensitive for her. Alessandra reassures her that it's something she can overcome, emphasizing that it's her body and her right to explore her sexuality fully.\n\nThe scene shifts to two women on a couch, one in a mustard-yellow top and the other in an orange shirt. The woman in yellow expresses her reluctance to use sex toys, fearing it might set her partner up for failure. Alessandra interjects, suggesting a different perspective: that using sex toys is like a party, and the partner is invited to join in the fun. She emphasizes that sex toys don't replace a partner's role in providing pleasure, but can add variety and intensity to the experience.\n\nAlessandra then addresses the group, highlighting the importance of how one treats and speaks to their partner, and how that contributes to their partner's feelings. She encourages the women to try the items in their \"goodie boxes.\" The scene cuts to the women laughing and reacting to the suggestion.\n\nThe scene changes to a wider shot of the room, showing the women seated on a couch, and Alessandra sitting in a chair facing them. Three men enter the room and take seats on a separate couch. Alessandra welcomes them and asks if they're nervous. One of the men responds that he's looking forward to the session.\n\nAlessandra then asks the men about the best places to touch women to turn them on. They suggest the collarbone, neck, and thighs. Alessandra prompts them further, leading them to the heart and, finally, emphasizing the importance of treating and speaking to women in a way that makes them feel good. She encourages the men to try the items in their goodie boxes.\n\nThe scene shifts to a man with long hair and tattoos, sitting on a bed. He expresses his admiration for Alessandra's confidence in discussing intimate topics. He recalls a conversation with Alessandra where they discussed the taboo nature of such conversations, and how Alessandra's openness encouraged him to talk about it.\n\nAlessandra asks the men about their feelings on sex toys. Some express enthusiasm, while one man states he's never needed an accessory. Alessandra challenges his perspective, suggesting that sex toys can enhance pleasure and expand the range of sensations one can experience. She clarifies that sex doesn't always have to involve penetration, and that all erogenous zones are valid.\n\nThe scene cuts to a man in a white t-shirt, who says he's never needed an accessory. Alessandra responds humorously, pointing out that nobody \"needs\" a toy, just as one doesn't need utensils to eat steak. She encourages them to expand their possibilities for experiencing sensations.\n\nThe scene shifts to a man in a red baseball cap, standing in a kitchen. He's looking at his phone, reading a text message from Bronte that says \"No thanks.\" The scene then cuts to a city street at night, then to a man and woman sitting on a couch, discussing intimacy. The woman expresses frustration with the man's apparent difficulty with intimacy. The man appears distressed and unsure if he can continue with the experiment.\n\nThe scene changes to a man with long hair and a chain necklace, sitting on a bed. He reflects on Alessandra's workshop, describing himself as a sponge soaking up information. He expresses the need for more time to process everything he's learned.\n\nAlessandra addresses the group again, acknowledging that they've only scratched the surface of the topic. She introduces a challenge for the men: to plan the perfect romantic and intimate date for their partners. She emphasizes that the date doesn't have to be sexual, but should be intimate and erotic.\n\nThe scene cuts to various men planning their dates, using laptops and making notes. One man searches online for romantic date ideas. Another plans to recreate his Fijian honeymoon for his wife.\n\nThe scene ends with Ollie, wearing a lei, preparing a romantic surprise for his wife, Tania. He decorates their apartment with tropical-themed items and prepares coconut drinks. He expresses his excitement for the date and his hope that it will strengthen their connection.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\nLacoste (logo on shirts)\n\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Workshop room with a green painting on the wall\n* Couch with two women\n* Wider shot of the room with two couches and a group of women and men\n* Bedroom with an orange bedspread\n* Kitchen with wooden cabinets\n* City street at night\n* Living room with a beige couch and framed pictures on the wall\n* Apartment with a brown couch, a glass table, and a wooden room divider\n* Bedroom with a blue bedspread and a wooden closet\n* Apartment decorated with tropical-themed items\n* Beach in Fiji\n* Kitchen with a white countertop and a sink\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Intimacy and communication in relationships\n* Exploring sexuality and overcoming taboos\n* The role of sex toys in relationships\n* Planning romantic and intimate dates\n* Reflecting on past experiences and strengthening connections\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Alessandra (sexologist)\n* Woman in peach-colored t-shirt (Mormon background)\n* Woman in mustard-yellow top\n* Woman in orange shirt\n* Man with long hair and tattoos (Jesse)\n* Man in white t-shirt (Josh)\n* Man in red baseball cap (Harrison)\n* Bronte (mentioned in text message)\n* Ollie (planning a date for Tania)\n* Tania (Ollie's wife)\n* Sandy (mentioned in conversation)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.15921786,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14903527},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1302855,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.22541708},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08756394,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17217167},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"HIGH","probabilityScore":0.86971444,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_HIGH","severityScore":0.66628045}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1247,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178485}}}

A man with short brown hair and a gray shirt, later identified as Shannon, initiates the conversation. He observes that the group has been unusually quiet and asks if they want to hear something. A woman with long brown hair and a green dress, later identified as Claire, takes a sip of wine and encourages him to share.\n\nShannon expresses his desire to understand the recent change in atmosphere, describing a different vibe over the past few days. He then reveals that he spent the weekend with his cousins. Claire mentions an encounter she had over the weekend with someone she assumed was Shannon's daughter and the other person she assumed was her mother.\n\nShannon clarifies that the people Claire encountered were not his ex and child, but rather his cousin and second cousin. This revelation leads to a surprised reaction from the group, with one woman exclaiming, \"Thank God!\"\n\nIn a separate interview segment, Shannon, identified as a 30-year-old personal trainer from Victoria, elaborates on the situation. He explains that he spent the weekend with his cousins, and Claire, assuming the women were Shannon's ex and daughter, had brought it up. Shannon suggests that Claire was seeking drama but didn't find any.\n\nBack at the dinner table, the conversation continues. Someone asks for a description of the cousins to confirm they are different people. The group reacts with amusement and disbelief.\n\nA commentator analyzes the interaction, noting Shannon's lack of awareness that only a week prior, he had declared his love for his ex on television. The commentator suggests that Shannon's behavior demonstrates a lack of awareness of the situation.\n\nAt the dinner table, a man with a mustache and a floral shirt admits he didn't pay much attention to the encounter and recalls seeing a redhead. Claire confirms the woman was indeed a redhead. Shannon mentions that he and his cousin both have red hair.\n\nThe conversation shifts to Shannon's daughter's age, which is revealed to be four. Shannon jokes about having a new nickname, \"Teflon,\" because everything slips off him.\n\nThe scene transitions to Claire in a separate interview segment. She expresses her difficulty in accepting Shannon's explanation and suggests he may be receiving preferential treatment due to his gender.\n\nThe scene returns to the dinner table, where Shannon takes a sip of wine. The conversation continues, with Claire mentioning that she hadn't realized Shannon's child was four.\n\nThe scene cuts to an aerial shot of a city at night, then back to the dinner table where wine is being poured. The focus shifts to a couple, Alyssa and Duncan, who are having a sweet moment. Alyssa playfully tells Duncan she's watching them.\n\nJanelle, a 28-year-old beauty influencer from Western Australia, expresses her guilt in a separate interview segment about not sharing information with Sandy. She confides in Tahnee, who asks for details about the information and who it concerns. Janelle reveals that she overheard Harrison mention that Dan got another girl's number. This revelation shocks Tahnee and the commentators.\n\nHarrison, a 32-year-old builder from New South Wales, explains in a separate interview segment that he was at a bar with Dan when some girls approached them. One of the girls asked for Dan's number, and Harrison declined, taking her number instead and deleting it immediately.

Ken Elliott, who is now 88, was abducted with his wife in Burkina Faso near the Niger border in 2016 by a group believed to be linked to al-Qaeda. His wife was released a short time later. The Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, said they were concerned for Dr. Elliott's welfare, but he appears to be in good health, and they are pleased he is home with his family. Dr. Elliott and his wife ran a medical clinic in the area, where he worked as a surgeon.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about a 48-year-old man who faced court in New Zealand, charged with two counts of arson over the hostel fire in Wellington that killed six people. He's accused of first lighting a couch before setting the building on fire. The man's lawyer didn't apply for bail, and he'll be back in court next month.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about students at nearly a dozen Sydney schools who have been forced to revert to home learning this week as a COVID wave exposes a chronic teacher shortage. The Education Minister, Prue Car, said that on very rare occasions, there may be exceptions where particular year groups may have to learn from home, but this will be the last resort. Eleven schools across the state had between one and four days of home learning this week, but schools are still providing supervision for families who can't keep children home. Both the Education Minister and the department say the teacher shortage crisis is exacerbating the problem. If the virus sweeps through the staff room, it's difficult to find enough substitutes to fill in. At Liverpool Girls High School, 11 of 67 teachers were off sick this week.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about a new pay deal for teachers. Bosses from nearly all unions were at the table, offered a choice: take a 4% pay rise and a 0.5% superannuation bump or a cash bonus, which could see each worker get up to $4,000. They'll now go back to their workforces to discuss the deal. The Health Services Union boss was conspicuously absent a day after paramedics took industrial action. Jared Hayes has asked for a 6% pay bump and is threatening to escalate strike action if members don't get it.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about pubs and clubs being given three months to remove all external gambling signs under a state government crackdown. Signs that promote VIP lounges or players' rooms will have to be taken down, or venues could face hefty fines. It's part of Labor's gambling reform package, which also includes a trial of cashless gaming cards.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about Australia's care sector being given a workforce boost, with figures showing almost a third of new TAFE trainees are choosing free courses in nursing, early childcare, and aged care. Federal and state governments are waiving student fees in areas with skills shortages, and the program has attracted 150,000 enrollments so far this year. The Skills Minister, Brendan O'Connor, said that taking away the fee for some people makes the absolute difference between undertaking the course and not undertaking the course. Cybersecurity, hospitality, and construction courses are also being offered for free.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about the weather. Sydney will experience much cooler conditions over the next few days. Two cold fronts are on the way. The first hits on Friday, and the second hits on Sunday. This will generate a long list of really chilly days below average temperatures. Tomorrow morning could be the coldest, dipping to just 7 degrees. If it does that, it could break a 24-year record for Sydney in May. Daily maximums won't be getting above 20 degrees all the way until Tuesday. There will be a pretty stiff and chilly breeze all the way through the city and coastline until Tuesday.\n\nThe news segment then transitions to a story about one of Queensland's most wanted fugitives being behind bars in Sydney. The 27-year-old was last night involved in a wild pursuit through Sydney's southwest that saw him hijack a car at gunpoint and threaten residents. Queensland fugitive Mitchell Wilson was finally captured by New South Wales police, ending a dangerous crime spree spanning two states. Detectives say this was the 27-year-old last month, accused of firing an AK-47 at a man in Brisbane before burning down a home. For three weeks, he evaded capture until last night. He crashed a stolen sedan in Earlwood. Officers from the Inner West responded. He ran through a side yard before jumping a fence and hiding in Rob's front yard on an adjacent street. He seemed out of breath and worn out. By the time the witness came around to confront him, he had jumped the fence, but then came back after the witness mentioned the police were on their way. Police allege Wilson carjacked a man at gunpoint as he pulled up to a set of lights at Dulwich Hill last night before forcing him to drive to Campsie, where the 38-year-old was assaulted and fled from the vehicle. It's there Wilson took off in the Mitsubishi Lancer, crashing into a parked car on nearby Bexley Road. As a result of the search of the vehicle, two firearms were located: a pistol and an AK-47.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\nNine News\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\nNorth Parramatta\nSydney\nGoulburn\nWest Africa\nBurkina Faso\nNiger\nWellington\nLiverpool Girls High School\nCammeray Public School\nSydney Parliament\nCircular Quay\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\nCrime\nKidnapping\nArson\nTeacher shortage\nCOVID-19\nPay negotiations\nGambling reform\nHealthcare workforce\nWeather\nFugitive capture\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\nJames Hashim\nSamara Baker\nJustice Robertson Wright\nTiffiney Genders\nKen Elliott\nPenny Wong\nPrue Car\nAngelo Gavrielatos\nJared Hayes\nLiz Daniels\nAlex Heinke\nBelinda Russell\nMitchell Wilson\nDespa Fitzgerald\nBen Lal\nRob"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.112795524,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14414899},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.32338032,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.32509217},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.22405581,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17217167},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1530423,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17895599}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1523,"promptTokenCount":177237,"totalTokenCount":178760}}}

The reporter states that the inspectors they interviewed disagree with the VBA's claim of tidying up the industry, citing an unmanageable workload and lack of care from the VBA.\n\nThe scene shifts to an interview with a woman who discusses the pressure her husband, Rob Carcutt, a VBA inspector, faced at work. She explains that he was meticulous and couldn't cut corners, leading to consequences if he didn't meet targets. She tearfully recalls telling him to leave his job due to the pressure, but he felt responsible for the people relying on him.\n\nAudio recordings of Rob are played, where he describes his workload, mentioning visiting seven job sites in a single day and documenting every detail to protect himself, believing he was a target. He feared being managed out of a job for upholding standards. His wife confirms that he was indeed pressured to cut corners and documented everything to protect himself. She tearfully expresses her belief that the VBA caused his death due to the immense pressure.\n\nThe reporter reveals that Rob was a union member and had informed the union about his struggles through emails. The union, concerned about the situation, alerted the VBA managers, expressing fears that someone might take their own life. Tragically, their fears were realized. Rob's wife expresses devastation and anger, emphasizing that the work was Rob's life and the inability to perform his duties was heartbreaking.\n\nThe reporter states that Rob's story isn't unique, having spoken with five former and current VBA inspectors who were too afraid to speak publicly, except for one man whose identity is concealed. This man describes the VBA culture as \"toxic,\" highlighting the pressure on inspectors to prioritize quantity over quality. He criticizes the VBA's focus on the number of inspections rather than their thoroughness, citing the absurdity of counting inspections of vastly different scales as equal.\n\nThe scene shifts to the Royal Children's Hospital, where the VBA sent inspectors to assess the plumbing on medical gases. However, an investigation revealed that these inspectors weren't even qualified for the task. The reporter emphasizes that this incident is even worse than what happened at the hospital.\n\nThe reporter confronts Premier Daniel Andrews, informing him about the VBA's alleged encouragement of corner-cutting and reliance on FaceTime videos for inspections, potentially breaching building regulations. Premier Andrews acknowledges being aware of the toxic culture at the VBA due to a recent tragedy, but denies prior knowledge of the workplace problems. He claims to have been unaware of the issues before the tragedy, despite the reporter's assertion that the government had been informed.\n\nThe reporter concludes by stating that the VBA refused their interview request but issued a statement available on their website. She encourages viewers to share their thoughts on the show through social media platforms and promotes the 9Now streaming service.

The crowd cheers and celebrates her victory. Titmus expresses her desire for people to understand that one's origin doesn't determine their potential for achievement. She emphasizes the importance of inner drive and determination, regardless of background or resources.\n\nThe scene shifts to a preview of an upcoming segment titled \"In Too Deep.\" The host introduces a story involving religion, sex, and politics, focusing on a 20-year-old hotel pool attendant named Giancarlo Granda. A woman invited Granda to her room, unknowingly involving him in a three-way encounter with her husband. The couple turned out to be prominent figures in America's evangelical movement, with the husband, Jerry Falwell Jr., being a political kingmaker who supported Donald Trump's presidency. Granda's attempt to expose their hypocrisy led to a major scandal.\n\nFootage shows scenes of a pool party at a luxury hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, where Granda worked. The host describes the atmosphere and Granda's role as a pool attendant. Granda recounts being eyed by a woman who took pictures of him, leading to flirting and a proposition to go to her hotel room. Granda mentions feeling uncomfortable when the woman revealed her husband's desire to watch.\n\nThe scene shifts to a hotel room. Granda describes the encounter, where the husband, Jerry Falwell Jr., masturbated in the corner while watching them. The host reveals that Becky, the woman, later professed her love for Granda and suggested a holiday together with her husband. Granda expresses his surprise and questions the frequency of such behavior.\n\nThe host explains that Jerry Falwell Jr. was the president of Liberty University, America's largest evangelical college, and the son of famous televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr. The segment highlights the moral hypocrisy of the Falwells and their involvement in conservative politics. Dustin Wild, a former Liberty University student, describes the college's moral compass as spinning like a top, criticizing the leaders for using Christian faith to validate their political agenda and enrich themselves. He condemns their actions as offensive to Christianity. Footage shows Wild running in front of the US Capitol building.\n\nThe host reiterates the connection between Liberty University and the Falwell family, emphasizing their political influence. Granda expresses his increasing discomfort with the ongoing relationship and Becky's attempt to continue it. He describes feeling shocked when Becky professed her love for him and suggested a holiday together.\n\nThe segment ends with Granda recounting the encounter in the hotel room, where Jerry Falwell Jr. masturbated while watching them.

He reveals that their analysis of TikTok's source code shows the app collects more data than other social media apps, except for those built in Russia.\n\nVisuals transition to Potter walking down a staircase, then standing and speaking in a room with wooden beams. The reporter states that Potter's company cracked the source code of TikTok. Graphics of lines of code and various app icons, including TikTok, are overlaid on a smartphone screen.\n\nPotter explains that TikTok claimed they didn't collect GPS location data, but their analysis revealed heavy collection of location data. They also claimed not to collect device IDs, which identify each user and their phone, but this was also found to be untrue. Another significant finding was TikTok's claim that they don't have any user data in China, which was contradicted by their study showing regular connections to Chinese servers.\n\nThe reporter questions TikTok's claim of not having a server in mainland China, which Potter confirms as false. The report then shifts to a visual representation of how TikTok gathers private information. A young woman walks in a park while using her phone. A large TikTok logo pin icon appears next to her, indicating location tracking. Graphics show facial and voice biometrics being collected. The report details how TikTok accesses contacts and information from other apps running on the phone.\n\nThe scene changes back to Potter, who explains that TikTok collects keystroke patterns, rhythms, body language, face and body features, and clipboard data, which could include photos and passwords stored in the phone's memory. He mentions that the latest version of the app has a \"super location\" field that collects precise location data, including direction, speed, altitude, latitude, and longitude.\n\nThe reporter expresses disbelief at the extent of data collection and asks if there's anything TikTok doesn't know. Potter replies negatively. The report then introduces Victor Gao, who suggests the West is being paranoid. He argues that data security is a legitimate concern and government regulators should focus on ensuring privacy and data sensitivity are addressed rather than demonizing TikTok, which he considers an innovative company deserving protection.\n\nThe report returns to the reporter, who points out that there are no guarantees that ByteDance or the Chinese government won't access Australian or American personal information. Gao responds that if one follows that logic, no electronic device would be safe because generalized national security concerns can lead to seeing \"devils everywhere.\" He urges the Australian government to treat China as an equal to avoid creating an enemy with 1.4 billion people.

The hands of the bald man open the Bible and begin to turn the pages. The scene then returns to a close-up of the bald man, still wearing the dotted shirt.

It’s hard to believe how anybody could lack such basic common sense and understanding, and certainly to depart so far from those basic tenets of Christian faith.” The blonde woman from earlier, now wearing an orange shirt, appears. She asks, “So, is it brainwashing?” The bald man replies, “If you remove outside voices and then just keep everybody in-house and then feed them the narrative you want them to have, it’s a form of brainwashing.”\n\nThe scene transitions to a close-up of a man’s hands typing on a laptop keyboard.

She asks, “What did you know of Simon Titeru? What did you know about him?” The bald man replies, “He was a very warm, friendly, caring sort of person, quiet, um, soft-natured, you know, good guy, good person.” The woman says, “So, not someone who you would think would deliberately cause harm?” The bald man replies, “Not at all.”\n\nThe scene transitions to a close-up of a hand reaching for a book on a shelf.

She says, “I think most people watching would be really alarmed to think that the beliefs of a, a pastor or a church leader could potentially play a role in such a tragedy.” The man with the beard replies, “Once that critical thinking tap has been turned off, and they become totally subjugated to what this organization is all about, then really anything can happen. If one is at that point where it’s ‘God telling me this,’ then it becomes very, very difficult to resist that message and follow a different path.”\n\nThe scene transitions to the photo strip of the four deceased police officers.

She mentions going to the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) for help but received no assistance. She provided evidence, including photos, to the VBA, but they didn't take any action. She questions the purpose of the VBA and expresses frustration about taxpayers' money being used to employ people who seemingly do nothing. She feels that the VBA's existence is pointless. The woman in the video is asked if the VBA had done their job, whether she would be going through this ordeal. She responds with a definite \"no.\"\n\nThe video then shifts to a woman named Anne, who has lodged 14 complaints with the VBA over three years. The VBA stonewalled her, and the case is now considered closed. Anne is described as financially and emotionally destroyed, with her life savings gone. She expresses a feeling of everything being against her, and that the VBA has done nothing to help.\n\nThe video then shows a man who compares buying a car to buying a house. He says if something goes wrong with a car, you can take it back to the dealer and it's fixed immediately. With a house, you can spend half a million or a million dollars, and if something is wrong, you're on your own.\n\nThe video introduces Tamara Ralton-Stewart, whose house looks complete from the outside. However, the first attempt at building it was a disaster, requiring demolition and a rebuild by a new builder. Tamara describes it as the worst decision of her life. Her ordeal began eight years ago when she purchased the apartment off the plan. She had been saving for her first home since she was 12, and was finally going to realize the \"Great Australian Dream.\" Six weeks after a photo was taken of her and her partner in front of the apartment building, elation turned to despair. There was a hole in the roof where the drain pipe should be, causing the whole place to flood when it rained. This was just the beginning of the neglect and the many defects. The builder, Shangri-La Constructions, refused to fix the issues and told Tamara to take them to court. Tamara knew she was in for the fight of her life, but didn't expect it to cost millions of dollars. Two of the most dangerous defects were water damage, which led to toxic black mold, and flammable cladding, which made the building one of the most dangerous in the state. 80% of the building was covered in highly flammable EPS, similar to the polystyrene found in TV packaging. Tamara's little girl was diagnosed with asthma as a direct result of the mold. Tamara is heartbroken by this. In late 2020, the decision was made to demolish and rebuild the building, requiring a $2.1 million strata loan that costs $200,000 a year in interest. Tamara and the other owners in her block refused to give up. They paid for independent reports to prove to the VBA that their building was a disaster. In 2020, the VBA confirmed they had received all these reports, but after Tamara repeatedly asked why Shangri-La was still in operation, she received an astonishing admission of incompetence. The VBA had lost all but one of the reports. Tamara feels terrified and believes that no one is doing their job. Shangri-La was hit with a small fine and a three-month suspension, which was quashed on appeal. The company recently went into liquidation, but some family members are still building under another name, SLC Bayside.\n\nThe video then discusses the case of Rob Carcutt, a VBA inspector who took his own life 12 months prior. His widow, Andrea Holden, says he loved his job and it was his life. He didn't want to be anything else. While on vacation in the USA, Rob told the motel owner about a problem in the bathroom. The owner told Rob he was on vacation and didn't need to do inspections. Andrea describes Rob as having a very big personality and being full of life. She says it's unrealistic and unfair that he felt so stressed and had to go to work every day feeling like he was going to war. She finds it unforgivable. Rob, along with 40 highly skilled building and plumbing inspectors, was employed by the VBA to weed out non-compliant work on building sites. The inspectors were pressured to complete around 60 inspections a month, regardless of the faults they found. This pressure had fatal consequences for Rob. His main worry at work was the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), specifically inspection targets and numbers.\n\nThe video concludes with Premier Daniel Andrews being asked if the Victorian Building Authority is broken. He avoids answering directly, saying that it's the reporter's question and he's not there to say \"yes\" to that. He emphasizes the importance of builders living up to standards and delivering good products.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n60 Minutes, VBA (Victorian Building Authority), YANMAR, ORTEK, CENTURY 21, BONACCI, 360 Degree, EHS Assess, Build Cert, News 7, Nine News\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\nConstruction site with a damaged fence, a partially constructed house, the entrance to the Victorian Building Authority, a woman looking out a window, a close-up of the Victorian Building Authority sign, a construction site with danger signs, a building under construction, a woman sitting by a window, a couple's photo, a flooded room, a building with scaffolding, a cell phone displaying images of a damaged apartment, a moldy wall, a playground, a bulletin board with photos and notes, a defects report, a construction site with a crane, a construction site with workers, a man snorkeling in the ocean, a couple in a swimming pool, a man kneeling on grass, a woman wearing headphones, a couple posing for a photo at the Grand Canyon, a couple on a beach, a man drinking a cocktail in an outdoor shower, an aerial view of a housing development, construction workers on a site.\n\n**KeyThemes**\nIncompetence of the Victorian Building Authority, the devastating impact of building defects on homeowners, the pressure on building inspectors, the tragic consequences of workplace stress.\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\nAnne (homeowner), Tamara Ralton-Stewart (homeowner), Rob Carcutt (VBA inspector), Andrea Holden (Rob's widow), Daniel Andrews (Premier of Victoria)."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19930841,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16776322},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.22000723,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.29583958},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.30156806,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17106095},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.091382034,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15817478}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1380,"promptTokenCount":177238,"totalTokenCount":178618}}}

Chris Kohler, the finance editor for 9 News, reports from a used car lot. He states that car warranties have gotten longer, with many brands now offering five-year warranties on new cars. Some brands, such as Haval, Kia, GWM, MG, SsangYong, and Skoda, even offer seven-year warranties. These warranties also apply to used cars, provided they are still within the warranty period.\n\nThe scene then shifts to another reporter, who emphasizes the importance of factory warranties when buying a used car, as they provide peace of mind for families. The segment concludes with a shot of several used cars at the car lot.\n\nThe next segment is a breaking news report about the charging of a New South Wales police officer over the tasering of 95-year-old Clare Nowland. Police Commissioner Karen Webb speaks to reporters about the charges. The officer, a 33-year-old senior constable from the Monaro Police District, has been charged with recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault. He will appear at the Cooma Local Court on Wednesday, July 5th. Commissioner Webb states that the Nowland family has been informed of the development, and their thoughts and prayers are with Mrs. Nowland and her family. She also thanks the detectives who worked around the clock on the case.\n\nA reporter asks Commissioner Webb how hard the past week has been for her, given the accusations that the police were covering up the incident. She responds that it has been traumatic for everyone in the police force, but that this is one matter, and the rest of the police force continues to do their job 24/7 to protect and look after the citizens of New South Wales. Another reporter asks if the charges could be upgraded at any stage. Commissioner Webb says that it is possible, depending on what happens. A third reporter asks about the morale of the force at this point. Commissioner Webb says that this has been traumatic for everyone in the police force, but that it is important to remain fair and to see that the investigation is not prejudiced. She is confident that they have come to a position now, seven days later, that this matter is before the court without that interference. A reporter asks why the body cam footage has not been released. Commissioner Webb says that she is not the investigator. Another reporter asks how the police force will go forward from here in terms of its reputation. Commissioner Webb says that there are many thousands of officers who do the right thing multiple times every single day that don't make the news, and it only takes one incident to damage the reputation of the force.\n\nThe final segment is a weather report presented by Amber. She reports that the nights are as cold as midwinter at the moment, with lows around 1 to 9 degrees. It is currently 15 degrees in the city and 11 degrees in the west. There was early fog this morning, with visibility reduced to zero in Camden, 100 meters in Albury and Lismore, and 200 meters in Richmond and Moss Vale. Overnight lows were 4 to 8 degrees colder than average. Winds will become very strong and gusty tonight and into tomorrow afternoon across Tasmania, Victoria, and southeastern New South Wales as a front and trough cross. Brisbane will have a sunny day with a high of 24 degrees. Canberra will be cold but fine, with a high of 16 degrees. Rain will develop in Melbourne. New South Wales will see a few showers moving in from the southwest tomorrow afternoon as a cold front starts to cross the state. Coastal areas will be sunny, with temperatures ranging from 19 degrees in Bega and Batemans Bay to 24 degrees in Grafton. After patches of morning frost in the west, Sydney will be mostly sunny tomorrow with light northwesterly winds. Another cold night is ahead, with lows of 1 to 4 degrees in the west, warming up to highs of 21 to 22 degrees tomorrow. Coastal areas will reach 21 to 23 degrees. There is a high chance of showers on Friday, bringing up to 7 millimeters of rain and a high of 18 degrees. Sunny skies will return for the weekend, with highs of 18 to 19 degrees, reaching 20 degrees on Monday. Temperatures will warm up slightly next week for the last few nights of autumn, with overnight lows of 7 to 12 degrees. In the west, there could be a morning shower or two, bringing up to 3 millimeters of rain, but the cold front will bring a high of only 18 degrees. Sunny skies will return for the weekend, with highs of 19 degrees, warming up early next week to highs of 21 to 23 degrees. Overnight lows will stay chilly, ranging from 3 to 11 degrees.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n9 News\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\nUsed car lot\nNews studio\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\nCar warranties\nTasering of Clare Nowland\nWeather\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\nChris Kohler (finance editor, 9 News)\nKaren Webb (Police Commissioner)\nClare Nowland\nAmber (weather reporter)\nPeter Overton (news anchor)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.0267593,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.06954183},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.16776322,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.25238422},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.0685376,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.07159127},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09268759,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.115960866}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1160,"promptTokenCount":807063,"totalTokenCount":808223}}}

She says she couldn't care less and views it as water off a duck's back. She believes girls will find the person involved attractive and isn't personally bothered by it.\n\nThe scene shifts to a dinner gathering with several couples. The atmosphere is lively and jovial, with conversations and laughter filling the air. One couple discusses their week, mentioning a \"melting heart\" moment. Another couple talks about how happy one of them seems, contrasting it with a previous occasion.\n\nThe conversation takes a turn when Dan reveals that Harrison pulled him aside and mentioned a conversation he had with another person. Adam adds that Harrison apparently got a girl's number. This revelation sparks confusion and questions among the group. Claire asks Adam for clarification, and he explains that Harrison told him about getting a girl's number, though he's unsure of the specifics. Claire expresses disbelief, stating she can't imagine Dan doing such a thing.\n\nThe scene cuts to a television screen showing the dinner conversation. A commentator points out Dan's surprised expression upon hearing the accusation. The scene then shifts to a studio setting with three commentators discussing the situation. They highlight Harrison's attempt to blame Dan for his own behavior and the fact that Sandy, Dan's partner, isn't present at the dinner.\n\nBack at the dinner, Claire asks Dan directly if he got someone's number. Dan denies it, and Claire affirms her belief in him. Dan expresses confusion about the situation. Bronte briefly excuses herself. Harrison tells her, \"Alright, babe.\"\n\nThe conversation resumes with Dan explaining that Harrison told Adam about the phone number incident, which Adam then relayed to others. Dan clarifies that he wasn't present during the original conversation and doesn't know exactly what was said. Caitlin asks if Harrison was claiming he got another girl's number, and Adam confirms that's the gist of it. Dan then recounts the incident at the bar where a girl approached him and Dan, asking for Dan's number. Dan says he declined but offered his own number instead. He emphasizes that he immediately deleted the girl's number after she left. Claire and others express disbelief at Harrison's actions.\n\nMelinda, a 32-year-old CEO in fashion and beauty, comments that this is the dumbest story she's ever heard from Harrison. She points out that if girls approach someone, it implies they're approachable, and one should simply say no thank you and move on. She finds it ridiculous that the situation escalated to the point of exchanging numbers.\n\nThe conversation continues with Harrison defending his actions, claiming he did the right thing by not giving his number and deleting the girl's number immediately. Claire questions why he's even bringing it up. Harrison explains that he told Adam about it as casual conversation and didn't intend for it to spread. He feels everyone wants drama.\n\nThe commentators in the studio express frustration at Harrison's behavior and the collateral damage it's causing to other couples. They note that Dan hasn't said anything about the incident and hasn't challenged Harrison. They speculate that Dan might be avoiding a public confrontation out of respect for Sandy.\n\nBronte reiterates that she's done with the issue and wants to move on. She believes girls will be attracted to Harrison regardless and doesn't want to hear about it again.\n\nThe scene transitions to a group gathering where the couples are seated in a circle. Dan and his partner are shown sitting together. The experts address the situation, emphasizing the importance of transparency and honesty.\n\nThe scene shifts to a couple, Claire and Jesse, who appear to be in a happy relationship. Melinda comments on their romantic connection. Another couple, Lyndall and Cameron, are also shown enjoying each other's company.\n\nThe episode concludes with Shannon shocking the room with a revelation. The experts express their disgust at the situation. The episode ends with a cliffhanger, promising a twist that no one saw coming.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Ralph Lauren (logo on Harrison's shirt)\n* Red Arrow Studios (logo at the end of the episode)\n* Nine Network Australia (copyright notice)\n* Endemol Shine Australia (production company logo)\n* Married at First Sight (show title)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Dinner gathering at a restaurant\n* Studio setting with commentators\n* Group gathering in a living room-style setting\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Honesty and transparency in relationships\n* Drama and gossip within a group\n* Setting boundaries in social situations\n* The impact of rumors and miscommunication\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Bronte (28, Online Beauty Educator, WA)\n* Harrison (Bronte's partner)\n* Dan (42, Digital Business Owner, QLD)\n* Sandy (Dan's partner)\n* Adam\n* Claire (31, Kindergarten Assistant, VIC)\n* Caitlin\n* Melinda (32, CEO, Fashion & Beauty)\n* Jesse (Claire's partner)\n* Lyndall\n* Cameron (Lyndall's partner)\n* Shannon\n* Three experts/commentators in the studio\n\n\nI hope this detailed description meets your requirements.

He has arranged tea light candles in a heart shape on the dining table, along with a small potted plant in the center. A handwritten card with Caitlin's name and a heart drawn on it is placed on the table. Shannon has also lit candles and incense on a nearby console table.\n\nCaitlin arrives at the apartment, and Shannon covers her eyes as he leads her to the dining table. She is surprised and delighted by the romantic setup. Shannon reveals that he has also ordered a special meal for her, which he presents with a flourish. It's a chicken parmigiana with chips and garlic bread, a dish Caitlin enjoys.\n\nAfter dinner, Shannon gives Caitlin another card, a two-week anniversary card. She reads it aloud, and it expresses Shannon's hope that their relationship will blossom like the small plant he has given her. Caitlin is touched by the gesture.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Melinda and Layton's apartment. Layton is cleaning up a spill in the kitchen, using paper towels to wipe the floor. He explains that he was trying to light a candle but didn't have a lighter, so he tried to use the toaster to light some paper, which almost caught fire. Melinda expresses her concern about Layton's actions, questioning his intelligence and how they can run companies together if he makes such decisions.\n\nThe segment then flashes back to Melinda and Layton's wedding day. Melinda initially wasn't sure about Layton, even saying she would have swiped left on him on a dating app. However, something changed, and they became intimate a few days later. Melinda admits that the attraction came suddenly and intensely.\n\nThe scene returns to the present, with Melinda and Layton discussing their relationship. Melinda expresses her desire for a deeper connection with Layton. She feels that they have everything going for them but are both stubborn, which hinders their ability to reach a deeper level of intimacy.\n\nThe segment ends with Claire and Jesse in their apartment. Claire is getting ready to take Jesse to her favorite crystal shop, hoping to bring some positive energy into their relationship.

A woman who has played for the royals multiple times shares her experiences. She describes King Charles as a huge classical music fan who needs it in his life. She recounts a time when King Charles told her that classical music keeps him sane, calms him, and grounds him. The interviewer playfully suggests that the woman is the key to the King's sanity, which she humorously acknowledges.\n\nThe scene shifts to the coronation ceremony, with beautiful music playing in the background. The woman expresses her joy and pride at being part of the historic event. She describes the day as one of the best of her life and mentions seeing several celebrities, including Joanna Lumley, Emma Thompson, Steven Fry, and Boris Johnson.\n\nThe focus then turns to Scott Furssedon-Wood, Britain's High Commissioner designate to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. He reflects on the privilege of being part of the coronation and describes it as a once-in-a-generation event. He shares a personal story about King Charles sending a long, thoughtful, handwritten letter and flowers to his mother in the hospital when she was ill with cancer. This anecdote highlights the King's compassionate nature.\n\nThe segment then discusses King Charles' work ethic. A former colleague describes him as a workaholic and recalls a time when the Queen took him to Charles' study, which was piled high with paperwork. The colleague also notes that King Charles and Camilla are a couple who look into each other's eyes and are looking in the same direction, sharing common values and working tremendously well as a team.\n\nThe discussion shifts to the comparatively modest coronation ceremony in 2023 compared to the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The smaller guest list and scaled-back celebrations are attributed to King Charles' sensitivity to the current economic climate.\n\nThe segment concludes with a discussion about the republican movement in Australia and the possibility of Australia becoming a republic. Craig Foster, the new co-chair of the Australian Republican Movement, is introduced. He expresses his excitement to see how Australia responds to the coronation and believes that the time is right for Australia to become a republic. He notes that the republican movement has had to play the long game but feels that the time is now to question the crown.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes (news program logo)\n* The King and Us (program title)\n* Prince of Wales (pub name)\n* Fish & Chips (pub menu item)\n* Live Sport (pub sign)\n* Honda (logo on stadium advertising board)\n* Lion Red (logo on stadium advertising board)\n* Sovereign (logo on stadium advertising board)\n* Sanyo San (logo on stadium advertising board)\n* Australian Republic Movement (logo and website address)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Violin shop\n* Buckingham Palace (interior and exterior)\n* St. James's Palace\n* Westminster Abbey\n* Park\n* Hotel room\n* Restaurant with afternoon tea\n* Cricket stadium\n* Streets of London with coronation procession\n* Statue of Queen Elizabeth II\n* Studio interview settings\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* King Charles' love of classical music\n* The coronation ceremony and its significance\n* King Charles' compassionate nature\n* King Charles' work ethic\n* The relationship between King Charles and Camilla\n* The modest nature of the 2023 coronation\n* The republican movement in Australia\n* The possibility of Australia becoming a republic\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* King Charles III\n* Camilla, Queen Consort\n* Woman who played for the royals\n* Interviewer\n* Scott Furssedon-Wood\n* Scott Furssedon-Wood's parents\n* Joanna Lumley\n* Emma Thompson\n* Steven Fry\n* Boris Johnson\n* Queen Elizabeth II\n* Prince Philip\n* Charles Brandreth\n* Craig Foster\n\nLet me know if you'd like any adjustments or further details!"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07585824,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.12506537},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06754686,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16776322},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.10374877,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1602664},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.11920304599999999,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14903527}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":876,"promptTokenCount":822992,"totalTokenCount":823868}}}

She's reporting on Vivid Sydney, a light festival, and mentions a $20 million investment in New South Wales. The scene transitions to various Vivid Sydney displays, including a projected image of a bird, green laser lights, and a child interacting with a large, colorful digital screen. The reporter mentions that while most of Vivid Sydney is free, a new exhibit at the Royal Botanic Garden will cost $128 for a family of four. A man in a suit and tie is then shown speaking, attributing the decision to charge for the exhibit to the former government. The scene shifts to the Sydney Opera House, first in daylight and then illuminated with colorful projections. The man in the suit reiterates his satisfaction with the decision. The reporter concludes her segment, and the scene cuts back to the news studio.\n\nA male news anchor introduces the weather segment, and a female meteorologist presents the Sydney weather forecast. She describes a beautiful autumn day with blue skies and sunshine, but mentions a freezing morning with temperatures below zero in some areas. She then details the city's temperature fluctuations throughout the day and forecasts a cold, clear night with upcoming rain.\n\nThe anchor then previews upcoming stories, including a crime trio terrorizing Sydney suburbs, mayhem at a Shell shareholders meeting, a mass recall of ice cream, and dangerous school zones for speeding drivers.\n\nThe next segment details a crime spree involving three masked individuals. CCTV footage shows them breaking into a Desi Mart in Westmead, stealing money and causing thousands of dollars in damage. The owner of the Desi Mart expresses his devastation, mentioning the financial struggles his small business is facing. Police say the trio is also responsible for a home invasion in Longueville, where they stole an Audi. The stolen vehicle was later found abandoned in Annandale. A reporter on the scene reports that a 16-year-old boy has been arrested and charged in connection with the crimes. The hunt continues for the other two offenders.\n\nThe news then shifts to a report on dangerous school zones in Sydney. The most dangerous intersection is identified as Chalmers Street, Redfern, near Sydney High School, where 99 drivers have run a red light in the past 10 months. Other dangerous zones include Borella Road, Albury; Meredith Street, Bankstown; and Cox's Road, North Ryde. The Roads Minister expresses concern over these figures and emphasizes the importance of slowing down in school zones. Statistics reveal that there were over 15,000 speeding and red light offenses in school zones across the state over a 10-month period, averaging 52 per day.\n\nThe next story covers climate activists disrupting Shell's annual shareholder meeting. Protesters stormed the stage to protest the company's rejection of new carbon emission targets. Security personnel removed dozens of demonstrators.\n\nThe news then briefly mentions Prince Harry losing a legal challenge against the UK Home Office regarding his offer to privately pay for police protection. Security arrangements for Harry and Meghan changed when they stopped being working royals.\n\nThe next segment focuses on Sydney's greenest skyscraper, Central Park, facing a legal battle over combustible cladding. The owners have launched a lawsuit against the state government after being ordered to remove the cladding.\n\nThe news then reports on a former table tennis champion, Adam Green, pleading guilty to corrupt betting. Green used his inside knowledge of the game to place bets on international contests. He orchestrated a betting syndicate that placed over 1,000 bets in 2020, netting $473,000. Bookies noticed the suspicious activity and alerted authorities. Green was arrested and charged.\n\nThe next story is an exclusive report on a new, cheaper treatment for advanced prostate cancer. The drug, apalutamide, will be listed on the PBS, reducing the cost from over $40,000 a year to $30 per script or $7.30 for concession card holders. A patient named Graham, who has battled melanoma and prostate cancer, shares his experience and encourages others to persevere. The Health Minister highlights the significance of this new treatment, which can be taken at home.\n\nFinally, the news reports on a recall of Woolworths Cookies & Cream ice cream sandwiches due to metal contamination. Ice creams with a best before date of November 2, 2024, can be returned for a full refund.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Nine News\n* Shell\n* Woolworths\n* Netflix\n* Erlyand (apalutamide)\n* PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* Vivid Sydney light festival (various locations)\n* Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney\n* Sydney Opera House\n* News studio\n* Westmead, Sydney (Desi Mart)\n* Longueville, Sydney\n* Annandale, Sydney\n* Blacktown, Sydney\n* Chalmers Street, Redfern, Sydney\n* Borella Road, Albury\n* Meredith Street, Bankstown\n* Cox's Road, North Ryde\n* Shell shareholders meeting venue\n* Central Park, Chippendale, Sydney\n* Downing Centre, Sydney\n* Broadmeadow, Sydney\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Vivid Sydney light festival\n* Sydney weather\n* Crime spree in Sydney suburbs\n* Dangerous school zones\n* Climate activism at Shell\n* Prince Harry's legal challenge\n* Combustible cladding on Central Park\n* Table tennis betting scandal\n* Cheaper prostate cancer treatment\n* Woolworths ice cream recall\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Ruth Wynn-Williams (reporter)\n* Amber Sherlock (meteorologist)\n* Pete Overton (news anchor)\n* John Graham (Roads Minister)\n* Vijay Chaudhari (Desi Mart owner)\n* James Wilson (reporter)\n* Prince Harry\n* Meghan Markle\n* Adam Green (table tennis player)\n* Annalise Bolt (reporter)\n* Graham Oldfield (patient)\n* Prof. Anthony Joshua (oncologist)\n* Mark Butler (Health Minister)\n* Gabriella Rogers (health reporter)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14414899,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.117572024},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.31153157,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.38075927},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14903527,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.12940247},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08269742,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14706427}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1312,"promptTokenCount":807063,"totalTokenCount":808375}}}

She is visibly distressed and crying, her makeup smudged from tears. She expresses her frustration and hurt over the situation with Shannon, her partner on the show \"Married at First Sight.\" She feels responsible for his unhappiness and blames herself for the issues he's facing with his ex. She emphasizes her efforts to support and reassure him, but feels her actions have been in vain. She articulates her desire to find love and be loved, and expresses her deep disappointment that the experiment hasn't worked out as she hoped. Overwhelmed by emotion, she covers her face with her hands and sobs.\n\nThe scene transitions to the show's title card, \"Married at First Sight,\" with a graphic of a bride and groom and a red heart above them. This is followed by a shot of the Sydney skyline at dusk, transitioning to a close-up of the \"SKYE\" sign on a building, indicating the location where the participants are staying.\n\nThe narrator explains that after Shannon's emotional outburst, Caitlin has separated herself to regroup. Caitlin is shown wiping away tears and putting on sunglasses. The scene then cuts to Shannon, sitting on a couch, looking contemplative and running a hand through his hair. He expresses his belief that Caitlin must think he's an idiot, especially after the events of the past few weeks.\n\nCaitlin is then shown washing her face in a bathroom sink, expressing her feelings of being foolish. Flashback scenes are shown, depicting conversations between Caitlin and Shannon about his ex. Caitlin admits to still thinking about her ex, while Shannon confesses to still loving his ex. Caitlin expresses her desire to find love and be loved, but Shannon's continued communication with his ex has made her feel insecure and hurt.\n\nThe scene returns to the present, with Caitlin and Shannon sitting on a couch. Caitlin confronts Shannon about talking to his ex about her. Shannon admits to keeping his ex \"on the fence\" in case things didn't work out with Caitlin. Caitlin expresses her desire to leave, but decides to stay and confront the situation. She criticizes Shannon for his hurtful comments about her appearance and for not appreciating her support. She asserts her self-worth and demands respect.\n\nCaitlin walks away, leaving Shannon sitting on the couch, looking distraught. He puts his head in his hands.\n\nA preview for the next episode is shown. It features a dinner party with the other couples, and hints at a shocking allegation involving Shannon. The narrator teases that Shannon is at the center of the allegation, and that other participants have witnessed him with his daughter and another woman.

He emphasizes the need for decisive action to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nThe scene shifts to a reporter standing in a park, discussing Australia's inflation rate. He mentions that the ideal inflation rate would be between 2% and 3%, but the latest quarterly figures reveal a worrying 7%. While the rate is starting to decline, it has taken ten interest rate hikes to reach this point, indicating a persistent problem.\n\nThe video then shows a warehouse where workers are handling and processing fresh produce. The reporter explains that around this time last year, the price of a single head of lettuce soared to over $10. While salad is now back on the menu, the situation remains unpredictable.\n\nThe reporter interviews Stephen Biviano, a fresh food provider, about the price of tomatoes. Biviano states that tomatoes were previously around $25 to $30 a box, but are now over $50.\n\nThe video shows workers processing leeks in a factory. The reporter explains that Biviano has witnessed the devastating impact of inflation on businesses like his. Biviano's nearest competitor recently went into administration. Biviano describes the current business environment as incredibly challenging, with fluctuating spending across the board. He notes a downturn in spending, particularly among smaller businesses.\n\nThe scene changes to an economist, Gigi Foster, who describes the current time as the most interesting for economists in her generation. She expresses her excitement about being alive during this period. The reporter asks about the flip side for the average consumer, to which Foster responds that it is awful, unpredictable, and uncertain.\n\nThe video shows Foster working in her office at the University of New South Wales. A sign on her desk reads, \"Heaven will protect the working girl.\" The reporter states that if one wants an industry that is booming right now, it is a very good time to be an economist.\n\nFoster believes that people need to brace themselves for a long road out of this crisis. She notes signs of \"sticky inflation,\" meaning high prices will persist for years, not just months. She explains that sticky prices are those that take time to change, even if there are economic reasons for them to do so. She predicts more high prices and uncertainty before the situation resolves, estimating it will take at least a couple of years to return to pre-COVID levels.\n\nThe video shows Foster walking on campus at night. The reporter mentions that Foster is not afraid to tell Australians uncomfortable truths. He recalls her controversial statement during COVID that lockdowns were doing more harm than good. Foster reiterated her stance, stating that death is a part of life and that more people are being harmed by lockdowns than are being saved.\n\nThe scene shifts to a busy city street. The reporter explains that Foster is now raising a new concern: Australia's sluggish economy can be partly blamed on laziness and complacency among Australians. She issues an urgent call to action, warning of a potential recession if things don't change. Foster encourages people to get off the couch and do something, claiming it will make them feel better.\n\nThe video shows scenes of Switzerland, including the Alps, chocolate being made, cheese, and cityscapes. The reporter mentions that some countries, like Switzerland, have completely avoided an inflation crisis. Switzerland's inflation rate is about 3%, the lowest in the Western world.\n\nThe reporter interviews Professor George Sheldon from Switzerland's Basel University. Sheldon expresses disappointment that his country has a 3% inflation rate, while in Australia, they would \"kill for that\" rate. Sheldon clarifies that Switzerland aims for an inflation rate between 0% and 2%. He acknowledges that the cost of living in Switzerland is very high. The reporter suggests that the grass isn't always greener on the other side, to which Sheldon agrees and disagrees. He explains that Switzerland is often perceived as boring but has a specialized economy focused on high-end products, like Swiss Army knives and watches. This business model differs from larger-scale production in countries like the US and Australia.\n\nThe video shows Sheldon walking through a cloister and looking out a window. The reporter states that Sheldon believes Australia should look to another era for advice: the inflation experienced after World War II. The painful lesson from that time is that recovery from this kind of situation is a slow process. Sheldon emphasizes the need to rebuild the economy, comparing the current situation to the post-World War II period when production was geared towards armaments, and after the war, people wanted cars, causing the inflation rate in the US to rise over 10%. He explains that it takes time to lower inflation without causing high unemployment. He suggests that slamming on the brakes would lead to job losses.\n\nThe scene changes to a Salvation Army store in Australia. A woman is interviewed about the people coming through the door lately. She mentions seeing working people who have jobs coming in, which is distressing.\n\nThe video shows a Senate committee meeting on the cost of living. Senator Jane Hume, who used to work for NAB and Deutsche Bank, warns that the government needs to tighten its belt. She emphasizes that the cost of living crisis is a difficult but not impossible problem to solve. She believes the government must address the issue or risk a grim winter for thousands of Australians.\n\nThe video shows Hume chairing the Senate committee and then speaking in an interview. She reiterates the importance of addressing the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe video returns to economist Steven Hamilton, who agrees that the time for tiptoeing around the issue of inflation is long gone. He believes the Reserve Bank must raise interest rates on Tuesday and the treasurer needs to slash spending in the May budget. He explains that the more money the government hands out, the more demand increases in the economy, which is counterproductive.\n\nThe reporter summarizes Hamilton's point, stating that unless people are willing to accept sky-high interest rates, the problem will take time to fix. Hamilton emphasizes the need for time to lower inflation without causing job losses.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n60 Minutes (news program logo)\nToyota (forklift brand)\nGazzola Farms (produce brand)\nVisobin (produce brand)\nSchreurs (produce brand)\nAllandale (produce brand)\nKombola (produce brand)\nSelect Fresh (produce provider logo)\nCalifornia Oranges (produce brand)\nSun Pacific (produce brand)\nYelisha Farms (produce brand)\nAll Lift (forklift company logo)\nHeaven Will Protect The Working Girl (sign)\nMicrosoft (laptop logo)\nWhy Gender Matters (book title)\nOnly the Rich Can Save Us (book title)\nThe Wealth of Humans (book title)\nThe Economics of Everyday Things (book title)\nIntelligence: A Unifying Construct for the Social Sciences (book title)\nHoliday Inn (hotel chain logo)\nNAB (National Australia Bank)\nDeutsche Bank\nThe Salvation Army (logo)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\nPark with city skyline\nWarehouse with fresh produce\nProduce processing factory\nEconomist Gigi Foster's office at the University of New South Wales\nUniversity of New South Wales campus at night\nCity street with pedestrians\nSwitzerland: Alps, chocolate factory, cheese cellar, cityscapes\nSenate committee meeting room\nSalvation Army store\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\nInflation in Australia\nImpact of inflation on businesses and consumers\nGovernment response to the cost of living crisis\nComparison of Australia's inflation rate with Switzerland's\nPotential solutions to the inflation crisis\nImportance of fiscal responsibility\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\nEconomist (unnamed)\nReporter (unnamed)\nStephen Biviano (fresh food provider)\nGigi Foster (economist, University of New South Wales)\nProfessor George Sheldon (Basel University, Switzerland)\nSenator Jane Hume (Liberal Senator)\nSteven Hamilton (economist, University of George Washington)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.112795524,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20307489},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.122523345,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.276691},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19436789,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.22678408},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06954183,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.115960866}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1667,"promptTokenCount":743638,"totalTokenCount":745305}}}

The stopwatch hand is ticking. The scene transitions to a news studio where Tara Brown, the news anchor, is sitting on a stool. Behind her, there's a large screen displaying a man in a checkered shirt and flames engulfing piles of money. The title \"THE CONFESSION\" is prominently displayed in gold letters, with \"PRODUCER NAOMI SHIVARAMAN\" written underneath.\n\nTara Brown welcomes viewers to 60 Minutes and introduces a joint investigation with The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. She explains that they will expose a dubious global financial scheme that is currently active, impacting hundreds of Australian families and thousands worldwide. She emphasizes that many victims are unaware of their missing life savings, with potential losses reaching millions of dollars. She reveals that a key player, Chris Ridgeway, has decided to confess.\n\nThe scene shifts to a black Porsche Macan with the license plate \"RIDGYS.\" A man in shorts and a blue shirt, presumably Chris Ridgeway, approaches the car, opens the door, gets in, starts the engine, and drives away. An aerial view shows the car driving along a winding road surrounded by lush green trees.\n\nThe scene cuts to a room where a film crew is setting up equipment for an interview. Ridgeway, now in a checkered shirt, enters the room and adjusts his hair. He sits down, and the interview begins. A woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, the interviewer, asks him if he considers himself a crook. Ridgeway hesitates and admits that some of his recent actions have been terrible and shameful. He expresses remorse and apologizes, stating that he has no self-respect or self-worth and struggles to look at himself in the mirror.\n\nThe scene changes to Ridgeway walking down a set of stairs in a gray suit. The narration explains that he was employed at Shaw and Partners, a reputable financial broking house, where he held a position of trust as a senior advisor. This position allowed him to deceive his clients and friends, stealing their savings. However, he now claims to be a con man with a conscience.\n\nRidgeway is shown walking down a city street in his suit. The narration mentions that he wants to expose a global financial scheme that is still active. He's agreed to reveal his role, how his clients were affected, and how many were left destitute.\n\nThe scene cuts to an interview with a man with short brown hair in a dark blue polo shirt. He describes the situation as catastrophic, impacting everything from daily activities to family time. A woman with long blonde hair in a red top expresses her loss of trust in the financial system. A woman with long blonde hair in a black turtleneck says that the scam has had a massive impact on their overall lives.\n\nThe scene returns to Ridgeway, who is being interviewed. He admits that he hasn't done much to make himself trustworthy but that he's trying to be honest with himself and apologize. The interviewer asks him about the scale of the scheme. He estimates it to be around $5.5 billion USD.\n\nA montage of photos shows Ridgeway enjoying a lavish lifestyle with cars, vacations, and social gatherings. The narration explains that people worldwide were lured into the scheme, suffering not only financial losses but also the embarrassment of being deceived.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the interview with Ridgeway. He claims to be trying to tell people he's sorry. The interviewer asks if he honestly thinks he's a con man now. Ridgeway admits that he is pretty sure he is.\n\nThe narration continues, stating that Ridgeway isn't going down quietly. He intends to name names, accusing Andy Turner, based in Britain, and David Sutton, from Australia, of being the masterminds behind the scheme.\n\nBlack-and-white images show Turner and Sutton. Turner is a bald man with glasses wearing a checkered shirt. Sutton has white hair and wears a light-colored jacket. The scene transitions to Sutton walking across a street and getting into a car.\n\nThe narration explains that Turner is known to financial authorities for his involvement with a failed English bank called First London. Sutton is associated with dodgy North Korean mining companies.\n\nRidgeway is again shown driving his Porsche. He claims his role was as a middleman, signing up investors for Turner and Sutton's scheme in exchange for lucrative secret kickbacks. He misled his clients by claiming that Shaw and Partners endorsed the deals.\n\nThe scene cuts to a shot of a building with the sign \"ONE ONE ONE.\" Ridgeway is shown looking up at the building.\n\nRidgeway admits to acting off the books and acknowledges that he knew it was wrong. He explains that he was motivated by greed and desperation for money. A montage of photos reappears, showcasing Ridgeway's lavish lifestyle. The narration emphasizes that his clients were unaware that their savings were funding his extravagance.\n\nThe scene shifts to an interview with a woman with short blonde hair wearing a light green top. She states that Ridgeway never mentioned receiving a commission, which was later discovered to be substantial.\n\nA woman in a pink shirt gets into a black Mazda and drives away. The narration explains that unlike Ridgeway's flashy car, this woman, Leeth, needs her car for work. She was supposed to be retired, but due to her trusted financial advisor, she now needs to work.\n\nLeeth is shown driving her car. The narration explains that she has known Ridgeway for 30 years and that he was a pallbearer at her husband Mark's funeral. They were close friends.\n\nA photo shows a funeral procession with Ridgeway as one of the pallbearers. Leeth and the interviewer are looking at photos. Leeth explains that Ridgeway was a trusted member of their friendship group. She expresses her horror at the thought of being groomed by him.\n\nLeeth is shown walking down a city street. The narration explains that in 2016, Ridgeway proposed a plan to improve Leeth's financial security. He told her about a stock about to list on an overseas exchange, promising her a fortune if she invested early.\n\nLeeth is shown from behind, walking towards tall buildings. The narration explains that she wasn't randomly approached but that the proposition occurred in the offices of Shaw and Partners. Ridgeway was a senior advisor there. Leeth emphasizes that she trusted him because of his position in a respected company.\n\nLeeth is shown in her kitchen, making coffee. She explains that Ridgeway asked if she had any more money, emphasizing the deal's potential. He claimed to have invested his entire inheritance. He convinced her to transfer $20,000 from her super fund, even though she wasn't wealthy, being a stay-at-home mom. The interviewer points out that Ridgeway squandered the money. Leeth agrees.\n\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes (news program)\n* The Sydney Morning Herald (newspaper)\n* The Age (newspaper)\n* Porsche (car brand)\n* Gucci (fashion brand)\n* Shaw and Partners (financial broking house)\n* Aston Martin (car brand)\n* Mazda (car brand)\n* Nespresso (coffee machine brand)\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* News studio\n* Winding road with trees\n* Interview room\n* City street\n* Conference room\n* Office building with \"ONE ONE ONE\" sign\n* Parking lot\n* Residential street\n* Kitchen\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Financial fraud\n* Betrayal of trust\n* Consequences of greed\n* Impact on victims\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Tara Brown (news anchor)\n* Naomi Shivaraman (producer)\n* Chris Ridgeway (confessed con man)\n* Adele Ferguson (reporter)\n* Andy Turner (alleged mastermind)\n* David Sutton (alleged mastermind)\n* Leeth Arnold (victim)\n* Mark Arnold (Leeth's deceased husband)\n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20055786,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1778111},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21469133,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.28776747},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.26284194,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.22678408},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.112795524,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17328803}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1705,"promptTokenCount":801749,"totalTokenCount":803454}}}

The text \"FLIGHTS BOOST\" and \"QANTAS ADDS MORE FLIGHTS ON INTERNATIONAL ROUTES\" appear on the screen. The outgoing CEO of Qantas, Alan Joyce, is shown touring the company's new flight training center at St. Peters. The center will provide training for up to 4,500 new and current pilots and cabin crew.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a news studio, where a news anchor in a pink suit is sitting in front of a backdrop of a city skyline. She reports that the state's firefighting force has welcomed more than 200 new recruits to its ranks. The recruits, 180 men and 45 women, graduated from the Emergency Services Academy at Orchard Hills. Among them is Hayden Langdon, who will now be joining his father on the front line.\n\nThe news anchor then introduces a finance reporter, Chris Kohler, who reports on the day's financial news. He states that the ASX rose today and over the week, with banks pushing the index higher. AMP is in the spotlight, having been fined $24 million for continuing to charge customers after they died. However, its shares rose today nonetheless. Netflix was the focus on Wall Street overnight, jumping 9% after it said its new ad-supported option is working. It now has 5 million people using Netflix with commercials. Investors liked that, but it's been a rollercoaster for the streaming giant. It was one of the big winners through COVID, with shares soaring while everyone was home watching. But then it collapsed when the pandemic faded. Now the shares are on the rebound again, up more than 100% in the last year. The Australian dollar rose into the weekend, buying 66.5 US cents and 61.6 euro cents.\n\nThe news anchor thanks Chris and then introduces Belinda with the weekend weather. Belinda reports that there are clear skies over Sydney tonight, which means another chilly night. The temperature is already sitting at 10 degrees in the west and 14 in the city. Tomorrow could be the coldest May morning in 24 years. The forecast is next.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a shot of a person grilling food on a barbecue. The news anchor reports that the Motherland African Festival is kicking off in Liverpool, celebrating the rhythms and flavors of Africa. Across New South Wales today, it's a sunny day with just a few light showers near the coast. Griffith had its coldest May morning in 33 years. The top temperatures are also cooler than usual for this time of year. Most suburbs are stopping at 19 degrees, with the city just a tad warmer, reaching 20 after a low of 9.\n\nBelinda then gives a more detailed weather forecast. She reports that tonight will be a cool start to the Motherland African Festival in Liverpool. Across New South Wales today, it's a sunny day with just a few light showers near the coast. Griffith had its coldest May morning in 33 years. The top temperatures are also cooler than usual for this time of year. Wagga Wagga only made it to 13 degrees. The cold spell is continuing over the weekend, with another cold front on the way, bringing showers to southern New South Wales tomorrow. Around the country, Adelaide and Melbourne are also in for some showers. It's a cold and cloudy day for Canberra, dropping to -2 overnight. Blue skies for Brisbane and Perth, with tops in the low 20s. Back home, it's another dry day for much of the state, with a shower or two about the southern slopes and ranges. Snow is possible above 1300 meters. The entire state is feeling that morning chill, even northern New South Wales. Narrabri is dropping to 1 degree, which is 7 degrees below average. It's a sunny day along the coast, with tops around 18 to 22 degrees. There is a strong wind warning in place for boaties on the south coast. Sydney will be much like today, with sunny skies again. However, it will be necessary to rug up, especially for Saturday morning sport. It will be even colder than this morning, dropping as low as 1 degree in Richmond, about 3 or 4 for the rest of the west. Tops will be around 19 or 20 degrees, which is about average for this time of year, including the city, after a low of 7. If Sydney hits that low, it will be the city's lowest May temperature since 1999. Similar conditions are expected on Sunday, just a bit more cloud about. The sunny spell is rolling on next week, warming up to the low 20s from Tuesday. In the west, it will be 20 degrees and partly cloudy on Sunday, then a run of sunny days, which means more chilly mornings, down to 3 degrees on Monday and Tuesday. Winter is still a few weeks away.\n\nThe news anchor thanks Belinda and announces that this is Nine News for this Friday. Ally Langdon is up next with A Current Affair. Before they go, she gives a quick reminder that this weekend is the Salvation Army's annual Red Shield Appeal. More people than ever are doing it tough, so if viewers have the chance to donate, the Salvos would greatly appreciate any support. The news anchor thanks the viewers for watching and wishes them a good evening.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* Qantas\n* Nine News\n* Netflix\n* ASX\n* AMP\n* Salvation Army\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* St. Peters, Sydney (Qantas flight training center)\n* Orchard Hills (Emergency Services Academy)\n* News studio\n* Liverpool (Motherland African Festival)\n* Various locations in New South Wales (weather forecast)\n* Australia (weather map)\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Qantas expanding international flights\n* New firefighter recruits\n* Financial news (ASX, AMP, Netflix, Australian dollar)\n* Weekend weather forecast\n* Motherland African Festival\n* Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Alan Joyce (outgoing Qantas CEO)\n* Georgie Gardner (news anchor)\n* Chris Kohler (finance reporter)\n* Belinda Russell (weather reporter)\n* Hayden Langdon (firefighter recruit)\n* Ally Langdon (A Current Affair host)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.035144947,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.09947014},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19930841,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.23091994},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06754686,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.115960866},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06371513,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.09807943}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1389,"promptTokenCount":91688,"totalTokenCount":93077}}}

It explores the potential influence of a religious group called The Potter's House on Singh's actions.\n\nThe scene shows a man with a shaved head sitting with his head in his hands, talking to another man with white hair. The shaved-headed man recounts an incident in court where his boss, Simon Tuteru, placed his hand on his head and prayed to remove a witch's curse. The text on screen reads: \"... put his hand on top of my head and prayed, in Jesus' name, take the curse away of the witch...\" After the prayer, Tuteru tells the man he is free to go.\n\nThe scene then transitions to aerial footage of the aftermath of the truck crash, showing emergency vehicles and debris scattered across a highway. Photos of the four deceased police officers are displayed: Lynette Taylor, Glen Humphris, Kevin King, and Josh Prestney.\n\nA man with a long white beard expresses his grief and disbelief, saying the truck driver should never have been on the road. A woman with blonde hair echoes this sentiment, stating that he shouldn't have been driving. The bearded man repeats, \"Should never have been on the road.\"\n\nA bald man, identified as David Vickery, the former head of The Potter's House in Australia, speaks about the church's influence. He says that people in positions of authority can get carried away and that tragic events like this can happen.\n\nThe scene shifts to Vickery picking up a red Bible from a table. He is then shown walking toward a podium in a church, holding the Bible. He opens the Bible and reads a passage. Vickery says he spent three decades in The Potter's House before leaving with his family. He now recognizes how deeply entrenched they all were in the church's fundamental doctrine.\n\nVickery expresses disbelief about the church's lack of basic common sense and understanding, and its departure from the basic tenets of Christian faith. The blonde-haired woman asks if it's brainwashing. Vickery explains that isolating people from outside influences and feeding them a specific narrative can be a form of brainwashing.\n\nVickery is shown working on a laptop with a Bible and other books open on the table. He reveals that during his decade as leader, he met Simon Tuteru, who was the pastor of a small Potter's House church in Melbourne. He isn't surprised by the truck driver's allegations about Tuteru's interest in witchcraft. Vickery says Tuteru encountered witchcraft in Africa, embraced it, and brought it back to Australia, believing it to be a platform of truth. The blonde-haired woman asks what Vickery knew about Tuteru. Vickery describes him as warm, friendly, caring, quiet, and soft-natured—a good person. The woman concludes that Tuteru doesn't seem like someone who would deliberately cause harm, and Vickery agrees.\n\nA hand picks up a book titled \"Cults: Too Good to be True\" from a stack of books. A man with a long white beard and a kippah, identified as Raphael Aron, the director of Cult Consulting Australia, sits in a chair in a library, reading a book. He believes Tuteru was religiously brainwashed at The Potter's House, which played a significant role in his decision-making. Aron says the truck driver's presentation should have been alarming and concerning. The blonde-haired woman expresses alarm that a pastor's beliefs could contribute to such a tragedy.

The scene then transitions to a man in a suit, Tom Steinfort, standing in front of Buckingham Palace in London. He introduces the program, \"60 Minutes,\" and welcomes viewers to London. He mentions that it's unusual for a 74-year-old to take on a new job, but that's the case for King Charles III. He notes that the new monarch has been officially crowned and now faces the challenge of filling his mother's shoes.\n\nSteinfort points out that polling indicates Queen Elizabeth was more popular than Charles, as are his son William, his sister Anne, and even his grandchildren. He adds that the new king needs to win people over not just in the UK but also in other countries like Australia, where the idea of a republic is being discussed again.\n\nThe video then shows footage of King Charles III and Queen Camilla on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, waving to the crowd. The narrator describes it as a moment in history. The scene shifts to a child sitting on someone's shoulders, taking a picture of the royal couple with a smartphone. The narrator mentions that the moment will stay with the attendees for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe video then shows King Charles and Queen Camilla on the balcony with other members of the royal family. The narrator describes the opulent crowns, heavy with precious gemstones and the weight of expectation. The narrator mentions that the traditional flyover had to be scaled back due to weather conditions. Prince Louis's waving is likened to windscreen wipers.\n\nThe video cuts to an interview with Valentine Low, the royal correspondent for The Times newspaper. Low talks about the huge outpouring of love for Charles and expresses his belief that Charles will be a better king than people expect. He then describes being inside Westminster Abbey during the coronation, witnessing every remarkable moment up close. He mentions the basis of the coronation ceremony goes back over a thousand years and that he felt like he was part of history. He praises the music and the splendor of the king's robes.\n\nThe video returns to footage of the coronation ceremony inside Westminster Abbey. The narrator describes the service as steeped in tradition but also with a nod to the changing face of modern Britain. A gospel choir is shown performing.\n\nThe video then shows the arrival of the Prince and Princess of Wales with their three children. Young George is described as watching his own future play out before him. Kate and Charlotte are described as radiant in matching Alexander McQueen gowns.\n\nThe video shows Prince William pledging allegiance to his father, King Charles, and sealing it with a kiss. Low comments on the genuine fondness between the two.\n\nThe video then shows footage of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, highlighting how young she was at the time, 25 years old. Her son, Charles, was only four years old. The narrator contrasts this with Charles's coronation at age 74, the oldest sovereign to ever take the throne.\n\nThe video returns to Prince Louis, whose yawns and waves caused a sensation. It then shows Prince Harry arriving alone at his father's coronation, without his wife Meghan and their children, who stayed home in America. Harry is shown sitting in the third row, his view sometimes obstructed. Low comments on Harry's decision to leave the service quickly and fly home, highlighting the fractured relationship between Harry, his father, and his brother. He also mentions Meghan's absence and expresses regret that she didn't attend.\n\nThe video then introduces Madeleine Easton, the only Australian asked to perform at the coronation. She expresses her disbelief at being part of such a historic event. The video shows her playing the violin. The narrator mentions that Madeleine is a member of the Baroque Soloists and Monteverdi Choir, of which King Charles is not just the patron but also a huge fan.\n\nThe video concludes with Low commenting on Prince Andrew's exclusion from the balcony display and his relegation to the third row. He speculates on Andrew's thoughts during the ceremony, suggesting Andrew might be in denial about his situation.

The scene is viewed through a window with plants in the foreground.\n\nThe scene transitions to an interview setting. A woman with short blonde hair and blue eyes, wearing a light green shirt and pearl earrings, speaks. She recounts receiving reports on the value of shares, which kept investors quiet. Another woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a dark blazer and a necklace, asks what the shares were supposed to increase to. The first woman replies that it was $40,000, and at the highest, about $1.6 million or $1.5 million.\n\nThe scene shifts to a person flipping through documents in a blue binder, revealing graphs and charts. The documents are described as high-quality with lots of detail.\n\nThe scene changes to an interview with the blonde woman in the red blazer and a man in a blue and white checkered shirt and khaki shorts. The man explains that the documents were detailed and unsuspicious clients were misled. He adds that the stocks they were assured would list never did, rendering their investments worthless. He shows the woman the documents, describing them as prolific in their production of information. The woman describes the situation as a sophisticated scam. The man agrees, saying it's very sophisticated. The woman asks if Chris Ridgeway believed it was legitimate when he first got involved. The man says Ridgeway did, but by the time he had doubts, it was too late because he was in too deep. He didn't know what else to do, so he clung to the idea that it would all be fine and people would make money. He adds that he stuck his head in the sand, and eventually, it didn't work anymore. The woman asks if he was living a double life.\n\nThe scene transitions to a title card: \"THE CONFESSION.\"\n\nThe scene then shows a man in a suit and tie walking down a city sidewalk. He enters a building labeled \"EXCHANGE SQUARE.\" The scene cuts to an interior shot of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) with stock tickers displayed on a screen. The man in the suit is seen looking at the screen. The narrator explains that in financial services, trust is everything, but senior advisor and stockbroker Chris Ridgeway breached that trust when he sold investors worthless products and strung them along for years. Now, before the authorities knock on his door, he's offering a groveling mea culpa.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the interview with the man in the checkered shirt. The woman asks if he understands that he's hurt a lot of people. The man replies, \"Yes, I do. And I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe scene shifts to a family arriving home. A yellow car is parked in the driveway. A man in a black shirt greets a teenage boy, a woman in a white dress greets a young girl, and they all hug. The narrator explains that the monetary damage Ridgeway caused can be counted in the millions, but the emotional harm is immeasurable. The couple, Darren and Kim Walker, used to be happily married, but they say Chris Ridgeway put an end to that.\n\nThe scene cuts to an interview with Darren and Kim, who are now divorced. Darren, wearing a patterned shirt, says their life was on hold for years, and the impact on their marriage and children was significant. Kim, wearing a black turtleneck top, adds that they thought they were doing the right thing by investing in a company they thought was legitimate. The woman in the black blazer explains that the Walkers' ordeal began eight years ago when they invested $200,000 in financial products spruiked by Ridgeway. Like others, he gave them an early tip on a stock that was about to list on an international exchange, assuring them they would make a lot of money. Darren and Kim took the bait, but eight years later, the stock still hasn't listed. Darren says it was like their life was on hold for years, waiting for the listing and making plans. He adds that Ridgeway always said it would happen, so they kept hoping. Kim says they thought they were doing the right thing, investing with someone they thought was legitimate.\n\nThe scene shows a person kayaking under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The text \"YOUR PARTNERS IN BUILDING AND PRESERVING WEALTH\" is superimposed on the screen. The scene then shows a man entering the Shaw and Partners office. The text \"Shaw and Partners, an EFG company\" is displayed. The narrator explains that at first, they believed the excuses Chris Ridgeway was spinning about the delays because they trusted him since he was employed by Shaw and Partners. Darren says Ridgeway worked for one of the biggest firms in Australia, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, so they thought it was a good way to go. The woman in the blazer asks when they realized something was fishy. Darren says it was around 2019 when he started digging and finding more information.\n\nThe scene shows Darren at his desk, working on his computer. He's looking at a website related to offshore leaks. The narrator explains that Darren's detective work was complicated and exhaustive. He became an expert on shell companies, overseas tax havens, and compliance failures. He discovered that one of the companies he'd invested in, which was supposed to list but didn't, had also been making extraordinary boasts without any backup. Darren says it was a four or five billion dollar unlisted public company in Australia with two directors and no central office. He adds that they never had an annual general meeting or put out audited accounts since 2017.\n\nThe scene shows Darren driving his car. He greets someone named Jason. The narrator explains that as it became clear to Darren and Kim that their money was gone, it also became obvious they were far from alone. Jason Hermann, in a white t-shirt, says they suffered enormously because the emotional stress ripped their family apart. He adds that no amount of money can replace that.\n\nThe scene shows Jason at his desk, working on his laptop. The narrator explains that like the Walkers, Jason Hermann's financial future has been destroyed by Chris Ridgeway. Back in 2015, he made a wise decision to give up motorcycle racing to spend more time with his family. But then he made a dreadful decision by asking his racing mate, Ridgeway, for advice about wealth creation.\n\nThe scene shows Jason racing a motorcycle and then standing in a racing suit. The narrator continues that Ridgeway's pitch to Jason was slick and full of promise, offering to buy shares at a discounted price before the stock was listed. Jason didn't know it then, but Ridgeway was secretly profiting from an elaborate and highly dubious deal allegedly engineered by Englishman Andy Turner and Australian David Sutton.\n\nThe scene shows Andy Turner walking in a parking lot and David Sutton walking across a street.\n\nThe narrator explains that Jason paid his money, and for the first few years, on paper at least, watched his $200,000 investment balloon. Early on, it was happy days, but as time passed, he realized his shares were really worth nothing because, despite repeated assurances, the stock wasn't ever listed on an exchange. Jason says he thought it would never happen, and it appeared to be fraudulent. By early last year, Jason was so fed up with Ridgeway's lies and excuses that he gave him an ultimatum: pay back the money or he'd complain to Ridgeway's bosses at Shaw and Partners. Ridgeway panicked.\n\nThe scene shows Jason playing with his young son in the backyard. He then sits at his dining table, working on his laptop. The narrator explains that Jason tried to convince Ridgeway not to complain, but because of the fear of what would happen to him, Ridgeway ran out of patience. He sat down on a Sunday night and wrote an email to Shaw and Partners. He says it took him four or five hours because he had to start from the beginning, going back to 2015. He adds that it was like some type of significant crime had been committed, and he just turned up at the police station asking for help.\n\nThe scene shows Jason using a calculator and looking at documents. He then stands at his kitchen counter, looking at a document.\n\nThe narrator explains that the music stopped for Chris Ridgeway. His scam was finally exposed, as was the true extent of his greed.

The scene quickly transitions to a view of a Princess Cruises ship docked at a port. Lagacé is then shown in an interview setting, where she asks, \"Do you want me to introduce myself as the drug smuggler?\"\n\nA news report follows, mentioning Lagacé and her accomplice, Melina Roberge, and their involvement in drug smuggling. Social media posts featuring the two women on vacation are displayed. A Rolling Stone article titled \"Meet the Worst Cocaine Smugglers of All Time\" appears on screen. Lagacé laughs while holding the magazine.\n\nThe 60 Minutes logo is displayed, followed by the show's intro sequence. An aerial view of Sydney Harbor, featuring a cruise ship docked, is shown. More social media photos of Lagacé and Roberge are displayed, along with images of confiscated cocaine packages. A couple, Barry and Nerida O’Rowe, are interviewed, and they express surprise at the women's actions.\n\nLagacé, in the interview setting, admits to accepting a trip and having 30 kilograms of cocaine in her luggage. Footage of authorities inspecting luggage containing drugs is shown. News reports from various sources cover the story of the two women's arrest. Lagacé is shown walking in a city setting.\n\nThe narrator describes how Lagacé and Roberge, blinded by the promise of money and a free luxury cruise, agreed to smuggle 95 kilograms of cocaine from England to Australia. They documented their journey on Instagram, believing they could get away with it. However, Border Force arranged a \"special welcome party\" upon their arrival.\n\nLagacé introduces herself in the interview, stating her name, age (34), and country of origin (Canada). She recounts how she accepted the trip in 2016 and got caught with the cocaine. News reports and social media posts related to the case are shown again.\n\nThe narrator highlights Lagacé's audacity in documenting her crime on Instagram. She is shown walking in a city setting. The narrator mentions that Lagacé now realizes she was wrong. She expresses regret in the interview, admitting that the story \"blew up\" due to their exotic photos and their young age. News reports and social media posts are shown once more.\n\nThe narrator emphasizes that Lagacé and Roberge's story serves as a reminder that crime doesn't pay. A border force officer, Superintendent Graeme Campbell, is interviewed, stating that no amount of money is worth losing everything. Lagacé, in the interview, acknowledges her mistake.\n\nThe narrator mentions that Lagacé is likable and self-deprecating. She agreed to the interview for a Canadian documentary, which might explain her involvement in the drug trade. She attributes her actions to simple greed. She recounts how she accepted the trip for the money.\n\nAn animated map shows the cruise ship's journey from Dover to Peru and then to Sydney. The narrator explains the plan: board the ship in Dover, pick up the cocaine in Peru, and transport it to Sydney for a $100,000 reward. Lagacé expresses her naive belief that the plan was easy and wouldn't lead to getting caught.\n\nThe narrator points out that two young women on a cruise ship full of seniors were bound to draw attention. Barry and Nerida O’Rowe are interviewed again, describing their encounter with Lagacé on the ship and their surprise at her age. Lagacé admits that she would have thought twice if she had known the cruise was primarily for senior couples. She regrets not doing more research.\n\nThe narrator mentions that the women's Instagram posts made it easy for authorities to track their activities. Superintendent Campbell explains that they received a tip-off about unusual passenger movements on the Sea Princess, leading them to monitor the women's activities. Social media posts of the women's trip are shown. Campbell notes that their public documentation of the trip made it easy for authorities to track them.\n\nBarry and Nerida O’Rowe are interviewed again, describing how they liked the women at the time, seeing them as just young kids enjoying themselves. Lagacé acknowledges that she was having fun and didn't fully grasp the gravity of the situation. She admits to posting photos because she was on a cruise. Superintendent Campbell calls their attempt brazen, highlighting their belief that they could succeed. The video ends with a final shot of the Sea Princess sailing into Sydney Harbor.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\n* 60 Minutes\n* Princess Cruises\n* Rolling Stone\n* Australian Border Force\n* AFP (Australian Federal Police)\n* ABC (American Broadcasting Company)\n* CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Company)\n* MAXIM\n* Radio-Canada\n* JD Sports\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\n* City street (possibly Montreal)\n* Cruise ship port\n* Interview setting (Lagacé's home)\n* News studio\n* Sydney Harbor\n* Silverwater prison\n* Animated map of the cruise route\n* Inside the cruise ship\n* Cruise ship deck\n* Ocean view from the cruise ship\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\n* Consequences of crime\n* Drug smuggling\n* Social media and crime\n* Greed and naivety\n* Law enforcement and investigation\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\n* Isabelle Lagacé\n* Melina Roberge\n* Barry O’Rowe\n* Nerida O’Rowe\n* Superintendent Graeme Campbell\n* News reporters and anchors from various sources\n* Elisabeth Garber-Paul (author of the Rolling Stone article)\n* 60 Minutes reporters and anchors\n\n\nLet me know if you need any further clarification or have more questions."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.28457657,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15713716},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.44311905,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.44311905},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.29259497,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.21866964},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20689407,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.28696766}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1237,"promptTokenCount":177234,"totalTokenCount":178471}}}

She mentions looking at prices more closely and choosing items based on their cost. The scene transitions to a graphic displaying the UBS logo and the Coles and Woolworths logos. The graphic shows the percentage increase in prices for fresh groceries (9.9%), dry groceries (9.4%), Vegemite and tomatoes (8%), and yogurt (14%) in April compared to the same time last year.\n\nThe video then shows people shopping in a Woolworths store. A man identified as James Hepworth, Woolworths Commercial Director, is interviewed. He states that the cost increase of groceries is beginning to moderate and that price increases are starting to slow. The video shows various sale signs in the store, including \"Prices Dropped,\" \"Special,\" \"30% Off,\" and \"40% Off.\"\n\nThe video transitions back to a graphic, this time showing a conveyor belt with the Woolworths logo. Text on the graphic announces a \"Price Drop\" on 450 winter essentials, including chicken, pasta, potatoes, and ice cream. Images of these items appear on the conveyor belt.\n\nThe video then shows people shopping in a Coles store and exiting an Aldi store. A woman identified as Dr. Eloise Zoppas from ACRS, Monash University, is interviewed. She says that people are looking for low-cost alternatives, changing brands, or looking at different products altogether.\n\nThe scene changes back to a grocery store, where a reporter named Annalise Bolt is standing in front of a pasta aisle. She mentions that supply chain issues caused by COVID and floods are now subsiding, making it easier for supermarkets to get products onto the shelves.\n\nThe video cuts back to the news studio, where the anchor, Peter Overton, introduces the finance report with Chris Kohler. Chris Kohler then presents a finance segment. He mentions that the market is confident that Congress will allow for a US debt deal, helping avoid an immediate recession. However, there is still some nervousness around. The ASX started the week slightly lower. The banks played a big part in the fall, with CBA shares remaining below $100. On the other side, tech and energy companies pushed higher. The Australian dollar was also weak, buying 66.4 US cents. A CBA analyst said it could lose a little bit more. One Aussie is also back to buying $1.05 New Zealand, which is the lowest level it's been so far this year.\n\nPeter Overton returns and presents the petrol prices for Sydney. The average is $1.754 a liter. It can be found cheaper at Condell Park and Revesby. He then introduces a segment about a state memorial service for Barry Humphries, which will be held on December 15th. Thousands are expected to attend the joint New South Wales Victoria occasion, which will take place at the Sydney Opera House. The video shows images of Barry Humphries and a scene from a performance where he is interacting with Prince Charles and Camilla.\n\nPeter Overton then introduces the weather segment with Amber. Amber presents the weather forecast for Sydney. Tonight will be cold and clear, dipping to between 4 and 8 degrees. Right now, it's around 14 degrees in the city and 11 degrees in the west. She then presents the weather forecast for the rest of the country. Tomorrow, Brisbane will be sunny at 23 degrees, Canberra will be cold but fine with a top of 14 degrees, Melbourne and Hobart will be cloudy, heading for 17 degrees with a shower or two, and Perth will have a few showers. Another cold and blue sky day is on the way tomorrow for most of the state with westerly winds adding a wind chill. Many inland areas will dip below freezing once again overnight. Coastal areas will be a little warmer. Sydney can look forward to more beautiful blue skies tomorrow with light winds, but it will be very cold, especially in the morning.

The narrator states that Ariarne Titmus chased her dream of becoming an Olympic swimmer. The youngest daughter, Mia, who was 12 at the time, shares her experience of telling her friends she was leaving in four weeks and how hard it was to leave her friend group. Her older sister, Ariarne, offers her some grass to feed to a horse.\n\nThe father, Steve, explains that when Ariarne wanted to pursue her Olympic dream, it wasn't a matter of waiting around in Tasmania. They had to make a quick decision, so they packed up their lives and moved to Queensland, the state that produces more Olympic swimmers than anywhere else in Australia.\n\nThe mother, Robyn, reflects on the decision, saying it was all good to say it, but they had to consider work opportunities. Looking back, she expresses a sense of taking a chance. A graphic appears on screen with the words \"Will to Win\" superimposed over an image of Ariarne in a pool, adjusting her goggles.\n\nThe scene shifts to the Titmus family home in Brisbane, where Ariarne and Mia are having breakfast. They playfully argue over food. Their father, Steve, gets caught in the crossfire. The narrator explains that eight years after moving from Tasmania, the real fight began for Ariarne in Queensland. She trained alongside her new coach, Dean Boxall, who is described as excitable and unpredictable.\n\nThe scene cuts to Dean Boxall celebrating Ariarne's win at the Olympics. The reporter asks Dean if he had any idea that the 14-year-old he saw in 2015, training alone in a public pool in Launceston, would achieve such success. Dean admits he didn't know at the time, but it became an urban legend, and he heard stories about the Tasmanian girl. He watched her closely and saw something special in her.\n\nDean explains that Ariarne wasn't the most talented, she was far behind in terms of skills and dives, but she was determined and could take critique, which he found coachable. When Dean took her on, he knew there was a lot of work ahead. At 54 kilograms, Ariarne didn't look like a swimmer and had never been to the gym. Dean had to turn her into a warrior, building muscle and strength, transforming her body.\n\nAriarne's father asks what the gym training is doing for him, and Ariarne explains that it helps her legs for kicking and turns. She knew only a warrior could beat five-time Olympic legend, American Katie Ledecky, widely regarded as the greatest female swimmer of all time. But back then, it was an impossible dream because in the 400-meter freestyle, Ariarne was a massive 16 seconds slower.\n\nThe reporter emphasizes the 16-second difference behind Katie Ledecky and asks how Dean found that time. Dean explains that it's as much mental, relationship, and trust as it is just swimming and training. Ariarne adds that Dean describes every athlete as a door, and he has to find the key to that door. She explains that she's different from other people in that she loves being told she can do better and being pushed to the edge. Dean knows exactly how to tap into that and get her agitated or annoyed, which motivates her to fight back and prove him wrong.\n\nThe narrator explains that Dean's style doesn't work for everyone, but it works for Ariarne. Seven years later, his coaching was rewarded. Ariarne Titmus knocked Katie Ledecky from her perch on the second night of the Tokyo Olympic Games, winning the 400-meter freestyle. The reporter asks Ariarne if she can still feel what it was like, even now. She describes the feeling of her legs on the last lap being \"cooked\" but still pushing through.\n\nThe narrator states that these days, Ariarne is more than a swimmer; she's become a brand wanted everywhere, a Victorian Racing Commission ambassador, and the face of Harvey Norman. Katie Page, CEO of Harvey Norman, took a chance on Ariarne three years before she won Olympic gold. She describes Ariarne as curious about the world and business, not just swimming, and predicts that she will be one of the leaders in the country.\n\nAriarne and Dean are shown walking together, and Ariarne jokes that Dean is more stressed than she is. She adds that they joke about him giving speeches at her wedding and being called \"Uncle Dean\" by her future children.\n\nBack at home, Ariarne opens a safe to show her medals and other sporting mementos. Her father mentions that there's no memorabilia or medals hanging up, it's all kept in a bank vault. Ariarne explains that her parents want to display some of her achievements, but she spends so much time at the pool and thinking about swimming that she wants to forget about it all when she's home. She thinks it's hard for her parents to understand that.\n\nThe narrator states that Ariarne is deep in training for Paris 2024. Her world record has just been broken by a 16-year-old Canadian swimmer. The reporter asks how she plans to go faster. Ariarne explains that at this level, the tiniest thing can make the biggest difference.\n\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\n\nNike, Harvey Norman, Speedo, Messina Ice Cream, 60 Minutes, Olympics logo\n\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\n\nGrassy field with a fence line, Titmus family home in Brisbane, swimming pool, gym, Olympic stadium, horse racing track, Harvey Norman store, public speaking event\n\n**KeyThemes**\n\nAriarne Titmus's journey to Olympic gold, the importance of family support, Dean Boxall's coaching style, Ariarne's post-Olympic success and brand endorsements, her focus on Paris 2024\n\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\n\nAriarne Titmus, Mia Titmus, Steve Titmus, Robyn Titmus, Dean Boxall, Katie Ledecky, Katie Page"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.22405581,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1302855},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.10087854,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.31912184},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.25683168,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13117331},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2436427,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.273575}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1304,"promptTokenCount":833612,"totalTokenCount":834916}}}

She is fiddling with a ring on her finger. The camera then pans up to her face as she speaks, saying, \"I came into this for genuine reasons.\" She continues, explaining that she entered the show because she needed to break her cycles and needed help. She states that she is going into a situation hoping to see some effort from Shannon and a sign that he wants to fix things too. However, she asserts that if she doesn't see that effort, she won't \"roll over.\" The scene transitions to a framed wedding photo of the woman and a man in a white suit, surrounded by flowers.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a wide shot of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, followed by a view of the Sydney Opera House and city skyline with a ferry in the foreground. The narrator states that the woman, Caitlin, is preparing to face her husband, Shannon, at a dinner party, unaware that she's not the only one with questions for him.\n\nThe scene cuts to a man, Shannon, in a hotel room, putting on his shoes. Another woman with long brown hair, wearing a green one-shoulder dress, speaks to the camera, recounting an incident where she saw Shannon with his daughter and another woman. She describes Shannon shushing her, which she doesn't appreciate. She expresses her intention to give Shannon a chance to explain himself, but also to speak with Lyndall to see if she witnessed the same thing.\n\nA man with long dark hair, wearing a rust-colored jacket and a black turtleneck, reacts to the woman's story with surprise, wondering if the other woman is Shannon's daughter's mother or his ex, whom he claimed to still be in love with. He expresses that he wouldn't have thought anything of the situation if Shannon hadn't shushed the woman.\n\nThe woman in the green dress is shown sitting at a vanity, applying makeup and talking to her reflection about the encounter with Shannon. She plans to ask Shannon about his weekend and who he was with.\n\nThe scene transitions to a woman with long blonde hair, Lyndall, sitting on a brown leather couch, fiddling with rings on her fingers. The narrator explains that it's been a quiet morning for Lyndall, who has received a frosty reception from her husband, Cam. Cam, wearing a floral shirt and beige pants, is shown in the kitchen area, preparing a drink. He expresses his frustration with Lyndall's involvement in other people's drama, stating that he doesn't want conflict in their relationship. He says he didn't sign up for drama and wants to focus on their relationship.\n\nLyndall confronts Cam about his attitude, arguing that she witnessed something concerning and it's not her fault. Cam insists that he doesn't want to be involved in other people's drama and wants to focus on their relationship. Lyndall retorts that the only conflict she sees is between them, and that she will ask Shannon about the situation tonight. Cam continues to express his frustration, saying he doesn't want to play \"Dr. Phil\" for everyone. Lyndall argues that she came to the show for a relationship and a marriage, not to abandon parts of herself for peace. She believes being honest and calling out wrongdoing is important for good friendships. Cam leaves the room.\n\nLyndall, now crying, expresses her frustration with Cam's lack of support and his refusal to acknowledge the tension between them. She reiterates her intention to address the situation with Shannon.\n\nThe scene transitions to the \"Married at First Sight\" logo. Then, a ferry is shown navigating Sydney Harbour, with the city skyline in the background.\n\nThe scene shifts to various couples in cars on their way to the dinner party. One couple expresses excitement about the evening, hoping the spotlight won't be on them. Another couple anticipates drama at the dinner party. A third couple discusses their nervousness about the potential for conflict.\n\nThe scene cuts to three experts sitting at a table, discussing the upcoming dinner party and the couples' dynamics. They highlight the importance of the commitment ceremony in revealing truths and prompting change. They express curiosity about how certain couples are getting along, particularly Caitlin and Shannon, and Melinda and Layton, given their strong personalities. They also mention the drama surrounding Adam and Claire's relationship at the commitment ceremony. They hope to see more couples united and strong at the dinner party.\n\nThe scene returns to the couples arriving at the dinner party venue. Melinda and Layton enter confidently, holding hands.

In many ways, it's rather surprising Ariane Titmus became an Olympic and world champion swimmer. You see, she's had to jump so many hurdles growing up. Athletics might have been a more appropriate sport. But this golden girl's determination to overcome challenges meant success in whatever she chose to do was almost guaranteed.

He says, \"Has it helped you with your success, do you think, coming from Launceston, Tasmania, an isolated, cold place in Australia, an island state?\" The woman in the blue shirt is shown again, speaking to the camera. She says, \"I think coming from Tassie keeps you grounded. This was actually a really great place to grow up. We had a lot of freedom.

And I think you should never forget where, where it all started.\" An aerial view of a town is shown. The man in the suit is shown again, speaking to the camera.

She says, \"I would come to the pool, pay a public fee entry into the pool twice a day, jump in, not have a lane hired, and do my 7K session around the public swimmers, and have no one time me. I had no clue what times I was doing. I was just there on my own, doing my own thing. And looking back, like, I actually can't believe I did that. I can't believe I had that in myself in grade eight.\" The young girl is shown again, this time standing with a man. The man in the suit is shown again, speaking to the camera.

And I thought, 'Oh, wow, this is actually what it's like on the mainland.' And I don't have any of this down here.

There were some kids behind us who were from Melbourne. And I turned around, and they looked at us, and they were shaking their heads, and they were going, 'You're from Tasmania?' Who is this Tasmanian girl that's come up and beaten a favorite in the last 15 meters? She just meant to win.\" The young girl is shown again, this time diving into a pool. The man in the suit is shown again, speaking to the camera. He says, \"It was a turning point in the life of Ariane Titmus. The little girl from Tassie was suddenly seeing a much bigger picture.

The man in the suit is shown again, speaking to the camera. He says, \"Yeah, training hard, achieving that dream.\" The young woman with braces is shown again, speaking to the camera.
