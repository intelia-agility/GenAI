He texted Becky, asking her to return his dog to his family if they found his lifeless body. He wanted to distance himself from the Falwells, but felt trapped as all doors were closing on him. \\n\\nFrom [00:00:47] to [00:01:04], the narrator explains that the Falwells had threatened to portray Giancarlo as an extortionist if he raised any alarm. However, Giancarlo possessed proof that Becky was the instigator, with Jerry Falwell Jr. also involved. This proof was a FaceTime call recording from January 2019, where Becky boasted about their sexual encounters while Jerry watched. Giancarlo confirms this, stating the recording is the \\\"smoking gun\\\" and evidence backs up his claims. He describes Becky as being naked or topless in the video, holding a glass of white wine, and pointing to the locations in her house where they had sex, including a kitchen island and one of her children's bedrooms. He also confirms having sex with her in the master bedroom. \\n\\nFrom [00:01:04] to [00:01:15], Giancarlo is asked what Becky is saying in the video.

He states that looking back, it is weird to think about, but they had sex in one of her children's rooms and also in the master bedroom. He believes the evidence is undeniable. \\n\\nFrom [00:01:46] to [00:01:51], Giancarlo states that he believes the case is closed if the evidence is analyzed, as it is undeniable. \\n\\nFrom [00:01:51] to [00:02:14], news reports show Jerry Falwell Jr. resigning from Liberty University amid a scandal involving an \\\"inappropriate personal relationship.\\\" The news reports mention Giancarlo Granda and his relationship with Becky Falwell. \\n\\nFrom [00:02:14] to [00:02:21], Mark Ebner, a New York Times bestselling author, describes the scandal as the \\\"drastic fall of an evangelical dynasty.\\\" \\n\\nFrom [00:02:21] to [00:02:31], Mark Ebner, shown reading his book \\\"Off the Deep End,\\\" is introduced as a New York Times bestselling author who has written a book about this political and religious scandal. \\n\\nFrom [00:02:31] to [00:02:36], Mark Ebner states that the Falwells believed they were untouchable. \\n\\nFrom [00:02:36] to [00:02:43], the interviewer asks if the Falwells were drunk on power. \\n\\nFrom [00:02:39] to [00:02:59], Mark Ebner recounts a conversation with Jerry Falwell Jr., where Falwell was being courted by Trump for a position in his cabinet.

He denies any involvement. \\n\\nFrom [00:03:49] to [00:04:01], the interviewer asks Falwell if the three-way tryst happened. Falwell denies it, saying he walked in on it three times and walked out. \\n\\nFrom [00:04:01] to [00:04:07], the interviewer asks Falwell why he would make this up, to which Falwell replies, \\\"Money.\\\" \\n\\nFrom [00:04:07] to [00:04:15], Becky Falwell is contacted and asked for an interview, but she declines, stating she is in bed. \\n\\nFrom [00:04:15] to [00:04:56], Becky admits to the affair and criticizes the hypocrisy of being held to a different standard because her husband was a university president. \\n\\nFrom [00:04:56] to [00:05:04], Mark Ebner comments on Becky's statement, pointing out that she claims Jerry forgives her, but she misses the key point of forgiveness, which is remorse.

A man in a black suit asks Josh why he wouldn't want to stay with his partner, implying that Josh has been saying negative things about her.  A woman in a black dress defends Josh, saying he is a nice, great guy. Another woman adds that he's a great guy, questioning why anyone wouldn't want to stay with him. The man in the suit points out that Josh's words are emotionally charged and heavy, suggesting they are hurting his partner. The camera focuses on Josh, who appears visibly upset, his eyes welling up with tears. The man in the suit addresses Josh, acknowledging his distress and stating that he's going to do something he's never done before in the experiment. He explains that he's never seen a relationship like this before and that there's no coming back for Josh in the experiment. He tells Josh that they won't subject him to this any longer. He then explains that usually if one person writes \\\"stay\\\" and the other writes \\\"leave,\\\" the couple stays in the experiment for another week to see if they can work things out. However, in Josh's case, he is being offered the option to leave. Josh decides to leave, and the man in the suit wishes him and his partner, Melissa, all the best. Melissa, who wrote \\\"stay,\\\" remains seated on the couch, looking disappointed. Josh gets up and walks away, and the other participants applaud.\n\n\nThe next couple called up is Alyssa and Duncan. They sit on the green couch, and the woman in the pink suit asks how they are doing. Alyssa replies that they are doing good, very good. Duncan agrees, saying they are very good. The woman in the pink suit suggests they start with their decision. Alyssa playfully hides her face behind her decision card. Duncan reveals his decision first, which is \\\"stay.\\\" Alyssa then reveals her decision, which is also \\\"stay.\\\" The woman in the pink suit asks about their intimacy week. Alyssa replies that it was a great intimacy week. The woman in the pink suit asks how great it got. Duncan says it was a great balance of dominance and delicacy. The woman in the pink suit laughs, and Alyssa jokingly says they don't have to get into details. The woman in the pink suit tells them to save that for next week. Alyssa says it ended with a bang. The woman in the pink suit laughs and says, \\\"There it is.\\\" The other participants applaud. The woman in the pink suit asks how their relationship changed this week. Alyssa says it made them even closer. The woman in the blue dress says she resonated with Alessandra's workshop, which suggested that the most comfortable way to start talking about sex is just talking about it. Alyssa thanks Alessandra for talking about that. The woman in the blue dress says she owes Alyssa her life. Alyssa says she owes herself for giving herself the opportunity this week to go there. The woman in the blue dress congratulates Alyssa and tells her to keep up the good work. Alyssa thanks her. The woman in the pink suit suggests they move on to the decision. Alyssa says it's going to be a tough one. Duncan reveals his decision, which is \\\"stay.\\\" Alyssa also reveals her decision, which is \\\"stay.\\\" The woman in the pink suit tells them to enjoy the next week. The other participants applaud as Alyssa and Duncan get up and return to their seats.\n\n\nThe next couple called up is Lyndall and Cam. The woman in the pink suit comments that they look very comfortable together on the couch. However, she notes that last night they didn't seem as close and connected. She asks them to catch everyone up on how things have been throughout the week. Lyndall explains that they had a good week with intimacy week, but over the weekend, Lyndall saw Cam with another person, assuming it was his ex and his daughter. Lyndall says that when she told Cam about it, she got a brick wall response from him, meaning he didn't want anything to do with it. Lyndall says she just wanted a bit of support, maybe like a backboard to brainstorm how to approach it. The woman in the pink suit notices Lyndall is smirking. Lyndall explains that it was the blunt way Cam said it that hurt her. Cam says that she is her own person and can say what she wants, and that he can't tell her what she can and can't say, but that he probably could have said it in a nicer tone. He apologizes if that's the message she got. The woman in the pink suit reminds Cam that this is his first relationship and that they understand that, so they're not expecting him to go from zero to 100 in the first three weeks. The woman in the blue dress adds that they have to find that balance where they can each maintain who they are but are able to be their full selves without fear that the other person is going to judge and perhaps leave. The woman in the pink suit says it's a learning process and that there are going to be hurdles along the way, so they should just persevere with it. She suggests they move on to the decision. Cam says there has been a rocky road for them, but he feels pretty confident of getting over it and moving forward, so he wrote \\\"stay.\\\" Lyndall also wrote \\\"stay.\\\" The woman in the pink suit wishes them a great week. The other participants applaud as Lyndall and Cam return to their seats.\n\n\nThe last couple called up is Caitlin and Shannon. The woman in the pink suit comments that it was a big one last night. She asks Shannon for her take on it. Caitlin says that for her, the most hurtful things Shannon said were that he wasn't attracted to her and that there was no attraction there. She adds that after that, he said that if there was someone that walked down the aisle that wowed him, he would have cut it off with his ex then and there. Caitlin says that because she didn't wow him, that is why what happened with his ex happened. The man in the suit asks Shannon how it makes him feel when the person he's in a romantic relationship with floors him with insults. Shannon says he doesn't really even have an answer for it. The man in the suit asks Shannon why he felt the need to say all those things to Caitlin that were insulting and deeply hurtful. Shannon asks if it matters. The man in the suit says it does. He asks Shannon what his motivation was to say those things. Shannon says that Caitlin is her own person and can say what she wants, so he can't tell her what she can and can't say. He adds that he probably could have said it in a nicer tone. The woman in the pink suit reminds Shannon that this is his first relationship and that they understand that, so they're not expecting him to go from zero to 100 in the first three weeks.

The woman who pleaded guilty was sentenced to four and a half years in jail. The judge said that the other woman wanted to be the envy of others and doubted that she was now. The Australian Border Force operation was a success, but there is always another target.\\n\\nThe video then cuts back to the interview with the parents. The father says that the people who came up with the idea should have been sacked. He also says that they should have just got a couple of old grandmothers and they would have got away with it. The mother laughs and agrees.\\n\\nThe video then cuts to an interview with the woman who pleaded guilty. She says that she knew what she was getting herself into and that she wanted the money. She also says that she knew it was illegal and that she would have been a big asshole with a lot of money if she hadn't been caught. She says that this lifestyle is behind her and that she just wants peace and quiet, friends, family, travel, and no luggage full of cocaine.\\n\\nThe video then cuts to a commercial break. After the break, the video cuts to a segment about inflation. The reporter says that there was a small drop in inflation, but that it's still way too high. He says that homeowners with mortgages will suffer even more because interest rates must rise further. In about 48 hours, we will know for sure if the Reserve Bank has the mettle to tame the inflation beast. In the meantime, it might be wise to assume the brace position.\\n\\nA woman named Chantel Schmidt can barely afford a car, let alone a house. After a post of hers on TikTok went viral about her rent being jacked up by $700 a fortnight, the freelance writer has unintentionally become a face for Australia's cost of living crisis. She says that her landlord is trying to increase her rent by $350 a week and that she was told it was not negotiable. The rental crisis is just one of the many knock-on effects of soaring inflation in Australia this last year.\\n\\nThe video then cuts back to the segment about inflation. The reporter says that whether we do this the long way or the short way, there's going to be pain either way. An economist says that there are no easy options and that we either have to choose high inflation or high interest rates. He says that the US went all the way, one and a half percentage points above Australia, because inflation just wasn't coming down as quickly as they wanted it to. He thinks that's about right and that there's a reason the US went all the way. He says that we think it will in Australia and that we're kind of crossing our fingers and hoping everything will be fine. He says that's not a good strategy for macroeconomics. He would be very surprised if rates didn't get above 5%. To get it to the fives, you're not talking one or two interest rate rises, but six or seven more to get inflation under control. He says that the only thing worse than high interest rates is high inflation, that it's very bad, and that it's something we cannot tolerate. As hard as it is for people paying mortgages, it's even harder if you've got rampant inflation. So we've got to keep some perspective about it.\\n\\nThe video then cuts to the economist writing on a whiteboard. He says that if you think an interest rate rise is unpalatable, wait until you hear just how many hikes he thinks Australia needs if it wants to get serious about bringing inflation down. He'd be very surprised if rates didn't get above 5%. To get it to the fives, you're not talking one or two interest rate rises, but six or seven more to get inflation under control.

The camera focuses on a woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a sparkly blue top. She expresses shock about something she's heard, saying, \\\"A bit shocked about that, to be honest.\\\" The camera then shifts to a group of four people sitting on a green couch. A woman with blonde hair and pink eye makeup speaks, questioning someone's actions and motivations. \\n\\nA man in a beige shirt and jeans walks up to the group on the couch, holding a wine glass. He asks if everything is alright and then sits down to join the conversation. He suggests that the issue will resolve itself if left alone. The woman in yellow disagrees, arguing that it won't resolve itself if no one addresses it. The man in beige insists that they should drop it. The woman in black with gold hair clips expresses concern that the situation will negatively impact one person in particular. The man in beige responds that he doesn't want to throw anyone under the bus and clarifies that he didn't tell anyone about the situation. He proposes talking to the person involved himself. The woman in black suggests that he should definitely talk to the person involved, so that the issue doesn't become a case of \\\"he said, she said.\\\" The man in beige agrees, saying that's exactly what he wants to avoid. \\n\\nThe scene cuts to three people sitting at a table, watching the events unfold on a television screen. The woman in red expresses concern, saying, \\\"Harrison's not happy.\\\" The man in black adds, \\\"He's got a problem.\\\" The woman in blue suggests that Harrison is either angry or drawn into the situation. The scene returns to the group on the couch. The woman in black with gold hair clips clarifies that the only thing she mentioned was that she wants to talk to Sandy. The man in beige nods and says, \\\"Sandy.\\\" The scene then cuts back to the three people watching the television. The woman in red comments that Harrison is lying to the group, allowing them to believe that Dan is responsible for the situation. She emphasizes that it wasn't Dan at all, but Harrison. She points out that Harrison is now claiming he deleted something. \\n\\nThe scene shifts back to Harrison and Dan talking. Harrison explains that Janelle overheard him telling Adam about the girls from Saturday night and that he told them he deleted their numbers as soon as they left. He reiterates that there's nothing more to the story and that, for him, deleting the number was the end of it. Dan confirms that he didn't even take the number, so he was fine. The scene cuts back to the three people watching the television. The woman in red expresses disbelief at Harrison's actions, pointing out that he spread the rumor about Dan when it was Harrison who got the number. The woman in blue agrees, adding that Harrison is now claiming he deleted the number, suggesting he might be trying to cover his tracks. \\n\\nThe scene returns to Dan and Sandy at the dinner table. Dan tells Sandy about his conversation with Harrison, explaining that Harrison told him Janelle overheard him talking to Adam about Saturday night. He says that he told Harrison he deleted the girl's number and questions why Harrison is telling Sandy this. Sandy asks if she has anything to be worried about, and Dan assures her that she doesn't. He explains that he didn't give his number to anyone and wouldn't do something so stupid, especially not when he's there for Sandy. Sandy expresses her frustration, saying that she's getting triggered because she likes Dan and is really into him. She questions why Dan is telling her this. Dan explains that Sandy has the right to question him, just as he has the right to question her. He reiterates that he didn't get a girl's number and wouldn't do such a thing. Sandy expresses her concern about trust issues with men, saying that if someone tells her something, her guard immediately goes up. She questions Dan's intentions, asking if he's there for the right reasons. Dan assures her that he is. \\n\\nThe scene cuts to Harrison talking to Bronte. He says that they made it through a dinner party with no issues and expresses pride in them. He adds that everyone, including himself, just wants things to work. Bronte acknowledges that it took them a while to get to a good place and expresses understanding that people are going to find each other attractive. She emphasizes that she's not insecure and accepts that girls will find Harrison attractive, but what he does with that is up to him. She reiterates that she's there and trusts him, and that's all they can do. Harrison thanks her. Bronte adds that she knows most people would find the situation triggering, but she and Harrison are in a good place. \\n\\nThe scene cuts to the three people watching the television. The woman in red expresses amusement at Harrison's story, finding it ridiculous that he claimed he got hit on and gave the girl his number to avoid rejecting her in front of his friends. She points out that Harrison actually said he took the girl's number. The woman in blue laughs and agrees, finding Harrison's story unbelievable. The man in black suggests that Harrison is full of himself and can't take rejection. The woman in red adds that he's so ruggedly handsome that it was inappropriate for him to reject the girl. She points out that Harrison is now saying he deleted the number. The man in black laughs, finding the situation amusing. The woman in red suggests that Harrison is trying to create drama. Bronte, speaking to Harrison, says that she knows most people would find the situation triggering, but she and Harrison are in a good place.

He later reflects that their connection has taken a healthy step in the right direction. Claire throws a crumpled piece of paper at a group of plastic water bottles arranged like bowling pins, knocking them over. She celebrates by dancing and cheering while Jesse covers his face with his hands and laughs. He later reflects that he won't be jumping back into bed with her tonight, but the net outcome of this is positive. He then throws the crumpled paper at the bottles, knocking them over, and Claire cheers. She hugs Jesse. Claire says she's sure he's good at something in life, but bowling isn't one of them. The scene transitions to a shot of the Sydney Opera House at night, followed by a shot of a taxi driving down a city street. The camera then pans up to a sign that reads \\\"SKYE SUITES.\\\" Bronte is shown settling into her new apartment alone. She sits on the bed and says that Harrison sent her a message about the date. She questions what in his pea brain would make him think she wants to spend more than two seconds with him. She adds that she just called him a gaslighter and a liar, and she stormed down and said she's done. She questions why he would still plan a date to make himself look good. She closes her suitcase and says that he literally does not care and does whatever Harrison wants. She says it sucks and she feels awful. She adds that she came into this with high hopes that this person is going to be everything she's been looking for, but so far, she's just been constantly let down by Harrison. She says it's just really disappointing. A producer asks her what she thinks he would've done for her. She says he would've wined and dined her on some coastline. The scene transitions to a shot of a framed photo of Harrison and his wife on their wedding day. Harrison is then shown sitting on a bench by the water, holding the photo. He says that he asked Bronte out, and she said no. He wanted to go last night, but at Bronte's request, he stayed, and he's here doing the work, and she's not here. He made the commitment to stay here another week and work on this relationship, and he's going to do that with or without Bronte. A producer asks him if he feels a bit awkward being on this date on his own. He says he's not on his own, he has his wife with him. People come from all over Sydney to chill here. This honestly has been one of the best dates he's had in a long time. They've done everything he wanted to do. The producer asks if he's hungry, and he says he is. He says he does feel like he and Bronte have shared a lot and been intimate. He had fun tonight. He asks the producer if they had fun, and they say they did. He says let's go get some dinner, babe, and gets up to leave. The scene transitions to Melissa and Josh's apartment. Josh tells Melissa to close her eyes and then open them in three, two, one. He reveals a LEGO set of Thor's hammer. Melissa is excited and says it's the best LEGO ever. Josh says it's just like Thor's hammer. Melissa says there's going to be a lot of Thor's hammer jokes here. She says it's so thoughtful, like something from everyone. Josh, tick. Melissa says that there was feedback yesterday from Alessandra about making an effort. Josh says he's very hopeful that Mel can see the effort that he's trying to show. Melissa asks about his childhood, whether he built growing up. Josh says they were outside kids, and his parents would have dinner parties. They were the cheeky kids that would sneak downstairs to see what the adults were doing. All the kids would come to their house and have snacks because his parents owned a supermarket. Melissa is surprised and says she never knew that. Josh says he doesn't feel like a sex object today. He actually feels that they're bonding. They're talking about their childhoods, which they haven't done the entire time they've been together. Melissa says that being a twin, she's never known what it's like to be lonely because she's always had someone there. Josh says that's really nice. Melissa says when they would get in trouble, she would say it was her sister. Josh asks if they were ever in the same class, and Melissa says they were, but then they had to separate them because they talked too much. Josh says he didn't think Melissa would be that talkative. Melissa says this is intimacy week, and it keeps ongoing the way that it's going. Hopefully, they can whip out their goodie bags and have some fun together. Josh says this was a really good activity, and he thinks it was a great conversation. If he had known that LEGO was going to bring them closer together, he probably would have reached into his LEGO inventory at home a lot sooner in this relationship. He feels like it's starting to take shape. Melissa asks if he's talking about their relationship, and Josh says no. Melissa says she's a little bit blown away. Josh says this is a great first step, and for him to bring this to the table, it shows that they can connect on multiple levels and get to know each other a little bit more. The scene transitions to Claire and Jesse's apartment. Claire knocks on the door and greets Alessandra, who is inside. Alessandra hugs Claire and then calls Jesse on the phone. She tells him that she has Alessandra there and asks if he can come down. Jesse agrees and says he'll be there soon. Claire says she's excited but a little bit nervous. Alessandra says that's good because it means this means something to her. Claire says of course it does. Alessandra says that for Claire and Jesse, the experiment has been very challenging so far. They've had to negotiate a lot of obstacles, but it is encouraging to see they've started to repair their relationship. She really hopes these exercises will help them this week. She tells Claire and Jesse to stand in front of one another, facing each other, and step forward. She tells them to hug each other and get their knees closer together. She tells them to simply feel their heartbeats and see what that's like. Jesse says it was a little bit like, \\\"Oh, this is really, really nice.\\\" He's not used to that, but standing there for a few minutes, he can feel himself becoming more and more relaxed. It was a touching moment. He would like to do more hugging like that with Claire."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.10818888,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.117572024},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.10374877,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1550786},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12085322,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.150029},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"LOW","probabilityScore":0.5418938,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.51415616}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1580,"promptTokenCount":1186763,"totalTokenCount":1188343}}}

The older man says, \\\"As a longstanding friend of the Royal Family, it's no surprise Jaws Brandreth loves the crown. Of course, saying goodbye to any long-term relationship, it would be a wrench, and there would be sadness. But I'm saying that their view, they are there to serve. If people in Australia feel having King Charles as the head of state has some value, is attractive, let's keep going with it. And I love the idea of you having our king as a shared bond between us. But if you don't fancy it, Tom, we're easy about that. We can take it. You're big enough and strong enough.\\\" The older man continues, \\\"We're big enough and strong enough. If I were you, I'd hang on in there. And you may find when you get the substitute, you may think, 'Oh, they were quite nice. They actually were already. He was a decent guy. And that Camilla, she really was.' And William is, and Catherine, and under the law, and George, and Louis, they're also lovely. We've lost them. We don't have them anymore. You may miss them.

The industry regulator, a vital arm of the state government, seems to have given up doing its job. It's called the Victorian Building Authority, or VBA. And its supposed to protect consumers from dodgy construction companies and tradespeople. On assignment for 60 Minutes, The Today Show's Kristina Hurn reports. The VBA's inaction is a crushing hammer blow for people trying to build a roof over their heads.\\\" The video then cuts to a woman and a man in hard hats and safety vests walking through a construction site. The woman says, \\\"This is as bad as it gets.\\\" The man says, \\\"It has to be replaced. It's got to be rebuilt.\\\" The woman says, \\\"This shoddy building by Shangri-La Constructions went up only a decade ago, but is now crumbling before our very eyes.\\\" The man says, \\\"I just think it's so embarrassing for our industry.

But especially in Victoria, because the construction industry is in crisis. By a half-million-dollar apartment, but do you get nothing?

And their own employees say the culture within is dangerously toxic.\\\" The video then cuts to an older man in a light blue shirt and a striped tie. He says, \\\"They are our regulator. They're supposed to look after compliance, and unfortunately, they fail that test completely.\\\" The video then cuts to a woman in a blue suit. She says, \\\"In what way are they not doing their job?\\\" The older man says, \\\"Why we've got, uh, more than 20,000 builders in Victoria, most of them do the right thing. But there's a huge element that are doing the wrong thing because they can get away with it.\\\" The video then cuts back to the woman in the blue suit. She says, \\\"And tragically, they are. Back in 2018, Anne wholeheartedly believed the watchdog had her back and was confident she was doing the right thing with her home builder. How did you go about choosing the builder? We checked the VBA website, uh, to make sure that, um, he didn't have any disciplinary action against him. And that's how we ended up going with him. At what stage did it reach a head with the builder? Well, it reached a head when we wanted a waterproofing specialist to go on site because we were very concerned about those walls. And he refused us access. The builder went even further, locking Anne out.

Singh told police that Tuteru talked about his own experience with witchcraft as a pastor in Africa. Singh also alleged that the pair even searched for a voodoo doll in his car. Instead of recognizing his employee's worrying mental state, Singh told police that Tuteru talked about his own experience with witchcraft as a pastor in Africa. Singh also alleged that the pair even searched for a voodoo doll in his car. The video then cuts to a reenactment of the conversation between Singh and Tuteru. The pair talked for 44 minutes, and Singh told a judge that the bizarre conversation centered around a witch who he believed had cursed him. Instead of recognizing his employee's worrying mental state, Singh told police that Tuteru talked about his own experience with witchcraft as a pastor in Africa. Singh also alleged that the pair even searched for a voodoo doll in his car. The video then cuts back to the news report, which includes an interview with Stuart Schultz, the husband of one of the victims. Schultz says that he is angry that Singh's boss shrugged off the warnings before the truck driver killed his wife. The video then cuts to a series of photos of Lynette Taylor, one of the victims. The video then cuts back to the news report, which includes an interview with an expert on cults. The expert says that the level of brainwashing, manipulation, and mind control that Singh was exposed to played itself out in the most ugly and dangerous way. The video then cuts to a series of images of the Potter's House church. The video then cuts back to the news report, which includes an interview with a former supervisor with Victoria Police. The supervisor says that he would have taken the person who was subject to the text to the side and asked him what was going on and why would somebody make those references. The video then cuts to a series of images of Singh being arrested. The video then ends with a shot of Singh being led away in handcuffs.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Highway\",\n      \"Courtroom\",\n      \"60 Minutes studio\",\n      \"Crash site\",\n      \"Potter's House church\",\n      \"City street\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Crash\",\n      \"Cult\",\n      \"Negligence\",\n      \"Grief\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Mohinder Singh\",\n      \"Richard Pusey\",\n      \"Lynette Taylor\",\n      \"Glenn Humphris\",\n      \"Kevin King\",\n      \"Joshua Prestney\",\n      \"Liz Hayes\",\n      \"Tom Steinfort\",\n      \"Tara Brown\",\n      \"Nick McKenzie\",\n      \"Amelia Adams\",\n      \"Stuart Schultz\",\n      \"Simon Tuteru\",\n      \"Stephen Harrison\",\n      \"Raphael Aron\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2982871,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.29340422},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.36026415,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.35220224},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.41774666,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.276691},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.22678408,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.30486867}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":949,"promptTokenCount":843084,"totalTokenCount":844033}}}

She says she doesn’t think Evelyn likes Rupert and that there’s no chemistry between them. The woman is identified as Melinda, 32, CEO, Fashion & Beauty. She says she doesn’t think it’s love at first sight or a “wow factor” between Evelyn and Rupert. She says it’s awkward for them because they haven’t had a chance to chat with their friends or family.

She is identified as Claire, 31, Kindergarten Assistant, VIC.

She says she doesn’t think it’s going to be a nice conversation, but it’s a conversation that has to happen. Claire pulls Jesse aside at the reception and asks if she can have a quick word with him outside. He agrees. They go outside and sit on a low wall.

He says Adam told him about the kiss. Jesse says he can’t wait to see Adam. He calls Adam a snake. Jesse says he couldn’t have imagined anything worse than what Claire did, and then she said something worse than that. He says he doesn’t know what type of kiss they had, but he’s imagining it was more than they’ve had in three weeks. Claire says she should have told him sooner and that she’s sorry she didn’t.

She is sitting in a dimly lit room with blurred lights in the background. The logo for \\\"60 Minutes\\\" is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen. As the camera angle shifts to a man in a suit and tie, he begins speaking, addressing the woman off-screen. The man's tie has a paisley pattern. He discusses how the TikTok app collects more data than other social media apps, except for those built in Russia.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a blurry shot of a man in a suit walking up a staircase in a building with wooden beams. The \\\"60 Minutes\\\" logo is still visible in the bottom left corner. The narrator states that few people understand the video-sharing juggernaut like Robert Potter, who is the boss of the Australian cybersecurity and intelligence firm, Internet 2.0. Internet 2.0 cracked the source code of TikTok.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to a fast-paced montage of computer code, keyboards, and smartphone screens with app icons, including the TikTok logo. The narrator explains that TikTok claimed not to collect GPS location data, but Internet 2.0 found evidence that they were heavily collecting it. They also claimed not to collect device IDs, which identify each user and their phone, but Internet 2.0 found that they were collecting this as well. Additionally, TikTok stated they didn't have any user data in China, but the investigation revealed that the app regularly connected to Chinese servers.\\n\\nThe woman in the white shirt reappears, asking the man in the suit if TikTok's claim of not having a server in mainland China is true. He confirms that it is definitely not true. The scene shifts to an aerial shot of a woman walking in a park. The narrator describes how TikTok mines a trove of personal information, including location, facial biometrics, voice characteristics, contacts, and information from other apps running on the user's phone.\\n\\nThe scene cuts back to the man in the suit, now wearing a gray hoodie, sitting at a table with the woman in white. He explains that TikTok can collect keystroke patterns, rhythms, body language, face and body features, and access the clipboard, which could contain photos, passwords, or other sensitive information stored in the phone's memory. He points out that the latest version of the app has a super location field that allows them to collect the user's direction, speed, altitude, latitude, and longitude. The woman expresses disbelief, asking if there's anything they don't know about us.\\n\\nA new man with glasses and a suit, Victor Gao, appears in a large, ornate building, possibly a train station, with people walking around. He suggests that the West is being paranoid about data security, and that it's a legitimate concern that government regulators need to address with foolproof arrangements to protect privacy and data sensitivity. He argues that TikTok is an innovative company that deserves to be protected, not demonized.\\n\\nThe woman in the white shirt reappears, now wearing a red blazer, and asks Victor Gao if there are any guarantees that ByteDance or the Chinese government won't access Australian or American personal information. Victor Gao responds that if you follow that logic, no electronic device would be safe, because if you generalize national security concerns, you'll see devils everywhere.\\n\\nThe scene briefly shows the TikTok logo in neon lights in an office setting, then cuts to people working at computers and talking in groups. Lee Hunter, TikTok's boss in Australia, agrees that the backlash is driven by politics, not facts. He insists that TikTok's priority is keeping user data safe, secure, and respecting their privacy.\\n\\nThe woman in the red blazer questions Lee Hunter, asking what would happen if the CCP or Chinese government asked for user data. He replies that they wouldn't give it to them. She counters that they wouldn't ask, they'd just take it. He acknowledges the need to be careful about working with China, but emphasizes that TikTok is an entertainment platform, not China itself.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a crowded room with many people taking photos, possibly a government hearing. A man in a suit, Mr. Shou Chew, is sitting at a table. A woman is holding a sign that reads \\\"downplay the parent company ByteDance, downplay the China association, downplay AI. From a leaked internal TikTok memo to company spokespersons.\\\" The narrator states that the US is leading the charge in this digital showdown, with lawmakers pushing for an outright ban on the app unless ByteDance sells off TikTok. The narrator suggests that what happens next could have far-reaching implications.\\n\\nVictor Gao reappears, stating that banning TikTok and forcing a fire sale is not a sign of strength, but the opposite. He urges the Australian government to treat China as an equal, arguing that they don't need to love each other, just get along. He says that creating an enemy with 1.4 billion people is a nightmare to avoid.\\n\\nThe woman in the red blazer concludes the program, thanking the viewers and inviting them to share their thoughts on the show via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. She directs viewers to 9Now to catch up on missed stories. She signs off and the 60 Minutes logo appears on screen with the Nine Production copyright notice.\\n\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08509916,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16667561},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14608715,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.21601154},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12592298,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17328803},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.04742599,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.06097524}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1224,"promptTokenCount":801788,"totalTokenCount":803012}}}

The scene transitions to a montage of Hugh in various acting roles, including one where he appears distressed and crumples sheet music. The narrator states that actors are often experts at hiding who they really are, and Hugh has been no exception. However, intense speculation about his personal life has caused him to rethink and pull back the curtain on the real Hugh.\\n\\nThe scene shifts to Hugh walking down a staircase with journalist Tara Brown. He reminisces about his time at NIDA, Sydney's famed acting school, and how he enjoyed hearing past students talk about their experiences in the industry. Tara reveals that during Hugh's time at NIDA, he was attracted to both women and men, but was advised to keep it quiet to protect his career. Hugh confirms this, recounting how two teachers at NIDA told him he would never get work if he came out. He points out that both of those teachers were openly gay themselves.\\n\\nTara explains that Hugh's sexuality was more fluid than people thought. After his first male relationship ended, he began dating a woman again. Hugh asserts that everyone who knows him knows who he is, acknowledging his relationships with both men and women. He expresses a desire to tell his story, leading to the reveal of a Stellar magazine cover featuring Hugh with the headline \\\"Packed To The Rafters' Hugh Sheridan addresses rumours about sexuality.\\\" The cover also includes quotes from Hugh: \\\"People assumed I was ashamed. I'm here to say I'm happy… and just working it out.\\\" and \\\"Hugh Sheridan's most honest interview yet.\\\"\\n\\nTara notes that Hugh began by writing it all down in a heartfelt essay, explaining the difficulty even he had in labeling himself. Hugh states that the confusion may not have lessened, but writing the essay was a liberating experience. Tara asks what he was declaring in the essay, and Hugh replies that he was declaring that people don't need to know all the answers. He admits that he still doesn't have all the answers himself, but that's okay with him. Tara points out that in his writings, he did put a label on himself. Hugh confirms this, but clarifies that he didn't use the label \\\"non-binary\\\" himself. It was a label given to him by others, and he decided to let them call him whatever they wanted. He was overseas at the time and woke up to headlines saying he was non-binary and using the pronouns \\\"they/them.\\\" Hugh clarifies that he identifies as \\\"he/him\\\" and never said he was non-binary.\\n\\nTara then asks why it was important for him to say he was bisexual in the article. Hugh explains that he felt it was important to be honest, as he likes both men and women. He acknowledges that there are many new labels now, but he didn't feel any of them fit him perfectly. He believes that one of the things that makes humans special is the ability to change their minds.\\n\\nDespite his openness now, Tara mentions that Hugh has always believed in his right to privacy, including keeping his long-term marriage to Rafael Dela Fuente private. Tara asks if he was married, and Hugh confirms that he was, for nine years. He finds it funny that the story broke when he got engaged to someone else. He was on the front page of a magazine, and people were surprised by the news. Hugh points out that he was married, and he had been engaged before that as well. He didn't feel like it was something that needed to be public. He also clarifies that his decision to keep his marriage private wasn't due to shame, but rather to protect the privacy of his partner.\\n\\nTara asks Hugh if it's ever acceptable to sacrifice someone by having them canceled for a bigger political point. Hugh responds that there are things people do that are not acceptable, specifically going out of their way to hurt someone or segregate people. He believes the question of who should be allowed to tell a story goes further in acting, as actors often portray characters different from themselves. He uses examples like Adolf Hitler and terrorists to illustrate this point. He argues that actors have to play these roles to tell the story, but it doesn't mean they are those people. He would like to see more transgender people playing transgender characters.\\n\\nTara asks if Tick, Tick… Boom! was his silver lining to being canceled from Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Hugh says that Tick, Tick… Boom! is a joy for him. He loves that the story is about determination and courage to keep going. He gets to tell that story every day, even though it can be tough and people might try to bring him down.\\n\\nThe program concludes with Tara Brown saying goodnight and providing information on where to find 60 Minutes on social media and Nine Now. The Lifeline number, 13 11 14, is displayed for anyone who needs support.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08509916,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1623801},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07477004,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.08389048},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.13296436,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.12506537},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20307489,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1968261}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1122,"promptTokenCount":843088,"totalTokenCount":844210}}}

Dan, a 42-year-old digital business owner from Queensland, is on a date with Sandy at an Italian restaurant. He says that Alessandra threw the challenge out to all the grooms to bring their A-game on date night, and that he wanted to choose a fun and intimate location where they could enjoy each other’s company. He says that one of the things they talked about on their honeymoon was cuisines, and that Italian was one that they spoke quite a lot about. He says that he wants to peel back the layers and see what they can learn about each other. Sandy says that she thinks Dan is intelligent and intellectual, which is very important to her. She also thinks he is well-spoken and open-minded, which are also important to her. Dan says that he picked up on Sandy’s loyalty in the experiment, and that he felt safe with her. Sandy says that she really liked that. She says that the date went really well, much better than she was anticipating. She says that she has never had a serious relationship, so talking about really deep things with a partner is something she is not used to. She says that she was really impressed with a lot of the stuff Dan was saying, and that she feels like Dan is becoming emotionally invested in her, and that she feels safe in his energy. She says that she feels like she is getting to know him a lot better. Dan thanks her for opening up with him, and she says that she really appreciates it. She says that she is interested to see what the rest of the week is going to bring for both of them. She thanks Dan and says that it felt good. \\n\\nThe scene changes to Harrison, a 32-year-old builder from New South Wales, sitting at a table with his laptop. He is planning a date for Bronte. He says that Bronte stormed off and made communication impossible, but that he has to focus on the fact that they were set a task by Alessandro to organize a date for their partner. He is planning a nice stroll around Barangaroo Reserve, with beautiful views of the harbour. He says that it is a really nice spot to have a picnic and relax. He says that he would love to be taken out on this date if it was him, and that he thinks the guy was really special. He sends Bronte a text asking her on the date, and she replies “No thanks.” Harrison says that it is obvious he is putting in the effort, that he planned the date and asked her out, which was the task. He says that Bronte said that she wants to be there and work on their relationship, but right now he does not see Bronte trying. He says that for him, it is just more evidence that what Bronte says and what Bronte does are two separate things. He says that he does not know what they are doing there. He says that whether she likes it or not, they are still going to go on this date. \\n\\nThe scene changes to Adam, a 35-year-old entrepreneur from Queensland, setting up a romantic date for Janelle in their apartment. He has flowers, chocolates, nail polish, and champagne. He says that it has been a tough time for Janelle, and that the commitment ceremony was pretty much bang out of order.

Adam removes her blindfold and gives her flowers. She says that they are beautiful. Adam says that the plan for the night is to give her a pamper night and let her know that he is there for her. He says that it has been a bit of a hard slog, and that he wants to apologize for putting her through what he has put her through and dragging her through it. He says that he wants to let her know that he appreciates her and is happy to get to know her. He says that he knows some of the outside stuff has really messed with him, but he cannot imagine how it has messed with her as well. He hopes that this will show her that he is there and is committed to her. Janelle thanks him for saying that, and says that she really appreciates it. She says that if they can get through this week together, she thinks they will be stronger. Adam says that enough talking, this is for her to enjoy. He gives her a foot massage. Janelle says that he has good hands, that they are very firm and big. Adam is glad that she is enjoying it. \\n\\nThe scene changes to Jesse, a 30-year-old marriage celebrant from Western Australia, knocking on Claire’s door. He has a bottle of champagne and a charcuterie board. He says that he did not want to do a date that was over the top, and that he wanted to keep something closer to home and get a bit of a boost towards a better place. Claire opens the door and says hello. Jesse says hello back. Claire asks if they are going, and Jesse says yes. Claire goes to get her bag. Jesse says that what he is going to do is try to show Claire that he is trying, and hopefully they can have a good time. Claire comes back and they leave. Jesse says that he is glad that Claire thinks his date idea is creative. Claire says that she was in a bit of a mood from the last night’s commitment ceremony. She asks Jesse if he is annoyed at her for writing “stay” and if he feels forced to be there. Jesse says that he does not feel like he is stuck there after she wrote “stay.” He says that he feels like he is there for a reason, although it is uncomfortable having to talk about some of this stuff. He says that part of him is grateful that he is still there because he wants to learn more about her. He says that he has to come to terms with his inner demons, and that he has a jealousy thing. Claire says that she will be conscious of that moving forward and do things like checking in with him and letting him know and keeping him in the loop, because she understands how it makes him feel. Jesse says that it was a hard thing to say that he is a jealous person, because it is not the best trait. He says that last night Claire said that this has not brought out the best in him. It is a hard realization to have. Claire says that she thinks it was really nice to see Jesse open up a little bit more. She says that whenever he is ready to express himself and be vulnerable, she will be there. She says that she feels so much better after this conversation.

He expresses regret for his role in a global scheme that has harmed many investors. He describes himself as arrogant, stupid, and up himself, claiming he believed he could fix the situation. \\n\\nA man in a white t-shirt sits at a table with a woman in a black jacket, discussing Ridgeway's integral role in the scheme. The woman mentions that one of Ridgeway's furious clients, Jason Herman, informed Ridgeway's bosses at Shaw and Partners about the senior advisor's actions. Shaw and Partners acted swiftly, questioning and subsequently sacking Ridgeway.\\n\\nThe woman in the red jacket asks if anyone at Shaw knew what was happening, and Ridgeway denies any knowledge on their part. She then questions how he managed to deceive the compliance system for seven years. Ridgeway explains that he relayed information he was given to clients, creating a false sense of prosperity and concealing the truth about their investments. He claims he didn't inform compliance, his state manager, or the CEO.\\n\\nThe scene shifts to a park where Carolyn Ridgeway, Chris's wife and mother of his three children, sits on a bench. The narrator explains that Carolyn was unaware of the deception until Shaw and Partners sent her a text message informing her of her husband's dismissal. She describes the situation as a nightmare, the worst thing that has ever happened to her, highlighting the decades of lies and betrayal by the person she trusted most. Carolyn learned about the forgery of her signature on financial documents when Shaw and Partners sent her the text message. She was completely blindsided by the news.\\n\\nCarolyn's eldest daughter was upset and questioned her father's actions. Ridgeway's response was that they didn't understand his business model. He then walked out. He admits feeling ashamed and wanting to run away to fix the situation before returning, prioritizing himself over his family's well-being. He acknowledges the devastating impact on his children and wife.\\n\\nThe scene shows a photo of Chris and Carolyn Ridgeway on their wedding day. The narrator mentions they were married for 35 years. Carolyn expresses her mortification at her husband's actions, revealing that he had forged her signature on financial documents for years, possibly hundreds of times. She points out that some of these forged signatures were on documents related to companies where she was listed as a sole director, companies she had never heard of.\\n\\nRidgeway admits to forging his wife's signature, claiming he was too stupid to tell her about it. He also admits putting her name on company documents as a director without her knowledge. He knew it was illegal but did it anyway.\\n\\nA montage of newspaper headlines and articles about the scandal follows. The headlines include \\\"Sacked stockbroker told wife to lie about alleged forged signatures,\\\" \\\"Broker forged my signature: wife,\\\" \\\"Fired broker accused of forging signature,\\\" and \\\"Broker urged wife to mislead regulators.\\\"\\n\\nStephen Helberg, a trained auditor with 40 years of experience and senior roles at corporate giants like Rio Tinto, Orica, and Ernst & Young, is introduced. He explains how he was approached by David Sutton and Andy Turner, the alleged masterminds of the scheme, to run a company called Aus Streaming Investments, a proposed mining venture. Initially, the venture seemed promising on paper, but Helberg soon discovered the company had no cash and couldn't trace the assets listed on the balance sheet. The asset value reported was $138 million Australian dollars. Six months later, he realized the assets didn't exist and contacted the external auditors, who confirmed they relied on independent valuations provided by David Sutton. These valuations were not independent and didn't comply with accounting standards. Helberg quit in 2017 and called in his lawyers. He was owed $250,000 in salary and millions of dollars in shares. He is still waiting for the money.\\n\\nThe woman in the black jacket reveals a report by Price Waterhouse Coopers, which details how they were appointed as liquidators to find Aus Streaming Limited's assets. After a year of searching, they found nothing of value. However, the report confirmed David Sutton and Andrew Turner's central role in the scheme. The report also urged ASIC to investigate potential misleading and deceptive conduct. Helberg believes ASIC needs to do more to stop the ongoing scam. He believes over 2000 people have been scammed, possibly more. He describes it as a well-planned, sophisticated global scheme to defraud investors. Ridgeway acknowledges the possibility of facing fraud charges and going to jail.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"City street\",\n      \"Meeting room\",\n      \"Park\",\n      \"Wedding\",\n      \"City street\",\n      \"City park\",\n      \"Office\",\n      \"City street\",\n      \"Parking lot\",\n      \"Shopping mall\",\n      \"Parking garage\",\n      \"City street\",\n      \"Office\",\n      \"ASIC building\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Financial fraud\",\n      \"Deception\",\n      \"Betrayal\",\n      \"Forgery\",\n      \"Investigation\",\n      \"Consequences\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Chris Ridgeway\",\n      \"Jason Herman\",\n      \"Carolyn Ridgeway\",\n      \"Stephen Helberg\",\n      \"David Sutton\",\n      \"Andy Turner\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21601154,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18832432},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19072437,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.26284194},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.36206627,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20689407},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.0685376,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13753287}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1269,"promptTokenCount":801788,"totalTokenCount":803057}}}

A news anchor introduces the bulletin with breaking news about a man in his 20s shot dead in Elizabeth Hills, Sydney. Police were called to the property just after 4 pm. Firefighters were also called to deal with two burnt-out cars in nearby Bonnyrigg Heights and Green Valley. \\n\\nThe news anchor then reports on the State Police Commissioner, Karen Webb, facing questions about the tasering of a 95-year-old woman. Webb defended her decision not to watch the bodycam footage or check in on the officer involved. The first police media release issued on Wednesday made no mention of a taser being used. The police commissioner said it took 36 hours to establish how the taser was used. The police officer who fired the weapon has been stood down pending the investigation, which could see him thrown out of the force or criminally charged. The family of Clare Nowland has maintained their silence and a bedside vigil at Cooma Hospital.\\n\\nThe news anchor then reports on an Australian man, Jason Kennison, who died on Mount Everest. Kennison had previously been told he might never walk again after a car crash, but he fought his way back from paraplegia to climb Mount Everest. The 40-year-old took on the world's tallest peak for charity but sadly died during the descent. He is remembered for his tenacity and resilience. Kennison and his team successfully reached the summit on Friday. On the way down, his team ran out of oxygen, and Kennison struggled. He had reached a ledge called The Balcony, just 450 meters below the peak, an area known to climbers as the death zone, and it's where Kennison died. His mother, Gill Kennison, said he was on top of the world, literally, and that's what he wanted to achieve, and he achieved that.\\n\\nThe news anchor then reports on a police officer, Ryan Barlow, found guilty of assault after footage of him forcefully arresting an Indigenous teenager at Surrey Hills was widely shared on social media. The footage, captured by the young Indigenous man's friends at Ward Park, shows Barlow subduing the teenager. Barlow claimed self-defense, saying that he subdued the teenager because he was starting to kick. The court heard that the leg sweep is not a technique police are trained to use, but it's not prohibited. The magistrate wasn't convinced by Barlow's claim that he was under threat in the moment he used such force. Barlow could serve time, but it's unlikely he'll again serve the public as an officer on Sydney streets.\\n\\nThe news anchor then returns to the developing story out of Elizabeth Hills. A man has been shot dead, and two cars were found on fire in nearby suburbs. Reporter Bianca Balzer is at the scene. The victim is aged in his 20s but is yet to be formally identified. Liverpool police were called to Hartford Shire Street at around 4 pm. When they arrived, they found the man sitting in his car with multiple gunshot wounds, including to his head. He could not be saved. The back window of the car has been shattered. Police are swarming the street, and crime scene tape is up. Police are yet to confirm whether these incidents are linked, but it does appear that there may be some connection.\\n\\nThe news anchor then reports on a cram timetable aimed at increasing services being blamed as the root cause of Sydney's serious rail failings. The State Government has vowed a maintenance blitz to get on top of issues but can't say when it will happen.\\n\\nThe news anchor then reports on a stabbing at Burwood last night. The 61-year-old victim was treated by paramedics for wounds to the stomach before being taken to Westmead Hospital in a serious condition. A 38-year-old was arrested and is being questioned by police.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Elizabeth Hills, Sydney\",\n      \"Bonnyrigg Heights\",\n      \"Green Valley\",\n      \"Cooma Hospital\",\n      \"Mount Everest\",\n      \"Surrey Hills\",\n      \"Ward Park\",\n      \"Burwood\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Breaking news\",\n      \"Shooting\",\n      \"Tasering of elderly woman\",\n      \"Mount Everest death\",\n      \"Police assault\",\n      \"Rail failings\",\n      \"Stabbing\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Peter Overton\",\n      \"Karen Webb\",\n      \"Clare Nowland\",\n      \"Jason Kennison\",\n      \"Ryan Barlow\",\n      \"Emma Partridge\",\n      \"Bianca Balzer\",\n      \"Adrian Kennison\",\n      \"Gill Kennison\",\n      \"Ruth Wynn-Williams\",\n      \"Rami Attia\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08632375,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1510279},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21469133,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.28219676},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14128152,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13568978},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.10818888,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15921786}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1135,"promptTokenCount":801194,"totalTokenCount":802329}}}

The scene takes place in a dimly lit room with a group of people sitting on couches. The focus is on a couple, Shannon and Caitlin, who are having a difficult conversation with a relationship expert. The expert asks Shannon why he said certain things to Caitlin, and Shannon admits that he said them to hurt her. The expert then asks Shannon to explain himself. Shannon apologizes for his actions and words, saying that they were disgusting and repulsive. He says that he is deeply sorry to Caitlin and the other people in the room. The expert then asks Shannon what his decision is: stay or leave. Shannon says that he wants to stay. The expert then turns to Caitlin and asks her what her decision is. Caitlin says that she wants to stay. The expert expresses surprise at Shannon's decision to stay, given his previous behavior. Shannon says that he has a gut feeling that tells him to stay. The expert then asks Shannon how he is going to change his behavior. Shannon says that he will buy Caitlin flowers and try to have a conversation with her where he shows her even the slightest bit of respect. The expert asks Shannon why he thinks he is a monster. Shannon says that it seems like in every relationship he has, he puts people down to make himself feel better. The expert asks Shannon where this behavior comes from. Shannon shrugs his shoulders and says he doesn't know. The expert says that this is the problem. When they hold Shannon's feet to the fire and need accountability, he shrugs his shoulders and says he doesn't know. The expert tells Caitlin that it is up to her what she wants to do from this point forward. If she wants to stay, then she stays. But if she decides that Shannon is not for her and not worth sticking around for, then she can leave. Caitlin says that she deserves to be respected and treated like a human being. She says that she came into the experiment hoping to meet someone she could love and who would love her, someone she could be proud of being with, someone who would appreciate her. She says that Shannon doesn't deserve her. Caitlin says that last time they sat there, Shannon said he needed to do better and would own it, but there has been no action, just an apology followed by anger, aggression, and defensiveness, not an apology that has been acted upon. Caitlin says that for her, she wanted someone to be proud of being with her, someone to appreciate her. The expert tells Caitlin that it's entirely up to her what she wants to do from this point forward. If she wants to stay, then she stays.

The vaccine is manufactured in France and is being tested in Australia. It is considered potent, with the potential to protect the body for years with just one dose. A nationwide trial is being led by Dr. Paul Griffin at Queensland's Mater Hospital. Dr. Griffin states that the protection from this vaccine will likely last longer than a traditional vaccine, and there won't be a need to match it to each flu season. Researchers are looking for 600 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 who haven't received their flu shot this year. The trial will be conducted in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. The reporter mentions a worrying statistic of over 40,000 influenza cases detected across the country this year, with 44 deaths. Dr. Paul Griffin warns that this year could potentially be the worst flu season he's ever seen. He emphasizes the need to change people's thinking and make them understand that the flu is a significant viral infection. Registration information for the trial is available on the Mater Hospital Brisbane website. The news segment then transitions to a report on Qantas, the Australian airline. The CEO, Alan Joyce, has announced his departure from the company with record-breaking profits. However, shareholders weren't pleased, and the share price dropped 2% today. Qantas forecasts almost $2.5 billion in full-year pre-tax profit, a record high. Despite this, the share price fell after strong gains in the past year. Overall, it was a flat day for the share market. Afterpay owner Block jumped 10% in four days as the government announced plans for more regulation on buy now, pay later companies. Banks rose, but miners fell. Wall Street futures point to a positive night in New York. The Australian dollar was mostly higher today, buying 66.6 US cents and 61.6 Euro cents. The news then transitions to a report on petrol prices in Sydney. The average price of unleaded petrol is $1.757 per liter, but it can be found cheaper at Concord and Revesby. The advice is to fill up now, as the price cycle is currently at its bottom. The segment then transitions to a report on a life-size Ferrari Monza SP1 model made from Lego, unveiled at Legoland in Denmark. The model, complete with a Ferrari steering wheel, was built in the Czech Republic with help from Ferrari designers. It took 339 days to build, using almost 400,000 Lego pieces. Finally, the news segment concludes with the weather forecast for Sydney. Tonight, the temperature will dip to between 1 and 7 degrees. Currently, it's around 14 degrees in the city and 11 degrees in the west. Today was a gorgeous Sydney day with clear skies, sunshine, and light winds. A beautiful sunset was observed. After a freezing start this morning for some suburbs, the temperature reached a top of 20 degrees in Richmond and Penrith, 21 in Kellyville, Blacktown, and Liverpool, 19 in Gosford and Terry Hills, and 20 degrees in the city. It was a freezing night across most of inland New South Wales, with temperatures 4 to 8 degrees below average. Today, it was mostly sunny, ranging from a top of 5 degrees in Thredbo to 19 degrees in Wollongong and Newcastle, and 24 degrees in Moree. The chilly weather will continue tomorrow as a high-pressure system remains over much of the country. However, a cold front is approaching over the next few days. Brisbane will be sunny and 24 degrees tomorrow, cold and clear for Canberra at 15 degrees, and partly cloudy for Melbourne at 17 degrees. Another freezing morning is expected across inland areas, dipping to -3 degrees in Mudgee and Bathurst, -1 in Dubbo, Griffith, and Wagga Wagga. Then it will be mostly sunny again across the state. Southern New South Wales is heading for tops in the mid to high teens, while northern New South Wales will mostly see tops in the low 20s. After possible fog and frost in the west, Sydney can look forward to another beautiful sunny day tomorrow with light winds. Some suburbs will be even colder tonight, dipping to between 1 and 7 degrees, before reaching a top of 20 to 21 degrees across the western suburbs, including Parramatta and Liverpool. Terry Hills will reach a top of 18 degrees, Gosford and the city will reach 20 degrees, and Cronulla will reach 19 degrees. Looking ahead, Thursday will be sunny, warming up to 22 degrees. Friday will see a shower or two and a cooler top of 19 degrees. The weekend will be cool but clear, reaching 18 degrees on Saturday and 19 degrees on Sunday. Overnight lows will range from 7 degrees tonight to 12 degrees on Friday morning. In the west, it will be mostly sunny and 22 degrees on Thursday. A cool change will move through on Friday, bringing a shower or two and a top of 19 degrees. Saturday will be sunny and 19 degrees, and Sunday will be partly cloudy and 20 degrees, with overnight lows of 3 to 11 degrees.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"France\",\n      \"Australia\",\n      \"Queensland\",\n      \"Mater Hospital\",\n      \"Brisbane\",\n      \"New South Wales\",\n      \"South Australia\",\n      \"Victoria\",\n      \"New York\",\n      \"Sydney\",\n      \"Concord\",\n      \"Revesby\",\n      \"Legoland\",\n      \"Denmark\",\n      \"Czech Republic\",\n      \"Richmond\",\n      \"Penrith\",\n      \"Kellyville\",\n      \"Blacktown\",\n      \"Liverpool\",\n      \"Gosford\",\n      \"Terry Hills\",\n      \"Moree\",\n      \"Canberra\",\n      \"Melbourne\",\n      \"Mudgee\",\n      \"Bathurst\",\n      \"Dubbo\",\n      \"Griffith\",\n      \"Wagga Wagga\",\n      \"Wollongong\",\n      \"Newcastle\",\n      \"Thredbo\",\n      \"Parramatta\",\n      \"Cronulla\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"New universal flu vaccine trial\",\n      \"Qantas CEO departure and record profits\",\n      \"Petrol prices in Sydney\",\n      \"Lego Ferrari model\",\n      \"Sydney weather forecast\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Dr. Paul Griffin\",\n      \"Alan Joyce\",\n      \"Chris Kohler\",\n      \"Peter Overton\",\n      \"Amber Sherlock\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.03904833,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.08509916},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21601154,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.31658104},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.05749323,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.09947014},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.04813668,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.08882041}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1498,"promptTokenCount":807098,"totalTokenCount":808596}}}

The segment opens with a woman walking through her kitchen, carrying a cup of coffee. The scene transitions to an interview setting, where the woman recounts how Shaw and Partners presented a seemingly lucrative investment opportunity, almost too good to be true. She mentions receiving reports on the increasing value of the shares, which kept her and other investors quiet. Another woman in the interview asks what Ridgeway was promising, and the first woman responds that he claimed a $40,000 investment would turn into $1.6 or $1.5 million at its peak.\n\n\nThe scene shifts to someone flipping through documents, highlighting their high quality and detail. The narrator explains that unsuspecting clients were deceived and their investments became worthless. The documents, presented by Andy Turner and David Sutton, were part of a sophisticated scheme. In an interview, Chris Ridgeway claims he initially believed the scheme was legitimate but realized it was too late when doubts arose. He describes feeling trapped and clinging to the hope that things would work out. The interviewer asks if he understands the harm he caused to many people, and Ridgeway expresses remorse.\n\n\nA transition occurs, showing a family arriving home and greeting each other warmly. The narrator states that the monetary damage caused by Ridgeway amounts to millions, but the emotional harm is immeasurable. The scene focuses on Darren and Kim Walker, a formerly happily married couple whose lives were put on hold for years due to Ridgeway’s actions. The impact on their marriage and children was devastating, leading to their divorce. However, they remain united in their determination to expose Ridgeway.\n\n\nThe scene changes to Chris Ridgeway walking down a city street, then entering Exchange Square, home to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The narrator explains that trust is paramount in financial services, and Ridgeway breached that trust by selling worthless products to investors and stringing them along for years. Now, before authorities investigate, he offers a confession.\n\n\nThe segment returns to the interview with Ridgeway, where the interviewer asks if he understands the extent of the harm he caused. Ridgeway confirms and apologizes. The scene shifts back to the Walker family, now divorced but united in their pursuit of justice. The narrator explains that their ordeal began eight years ago when they invested $200,000 in financial products recommended by Ridgeway. He promised them significant returns, claiming an imminent listing on an international exchange. They trusted him due to his employment at Shaw and Partners. However, eight years later, the stock hasn't been listed.\n\n\nDarren Walker describes feeling like his life was on hold for years, constantly waiting for the promised returns and making plans based on them. He expresses disbelief and disappointment. The scene shows Darren working on his computer, investigating the situation. The narrator explains that his work was complicated and exhaustive, leading him to become an expert on shell companies, overseas tax havens, and compliance failures. He discovered that one of the companies he invested in, Australian registered Alt Financial Group, which was supposed to list but didn’t, had been making extraordinary boasts without any evidence. Darren states that the company, with a supposed value of four or five billion dollars, had two directors, no central office, and hadn’t held an annual general meeting since 2017.\n\n\nThe scene shifts to Darren driving his car, then to Jason Hermann in an interview. Jason describes the immense suffering he and his family endured due to the scam, emphasizing that no amount of money can compensate for the emotional stress and family breakdown. The scene shows Jason at home with his young son, playing in the backyard. The narrator explains that Jason’s financial future was destroyed by Ridgeway. Back in 2015, Jason made the decision to give up motorcycle racing to spend more time with his family. He sought advice from his racing mate, Ridgeway, about wealth creation. Ridgeway offered to buy shares at a discounted price before the stock was listed. Jason invested $200,000. Initially, things seemed positive, but as time passed, he realized his shares were worthless because the stock was never listed on any exchange.\n\n\nJason describes feeling like something wasn't right and started investigating further. The more he dug, the more he found. By early last year, he was so fed up with Ridgeway’s lies and excuses that he gave him an ultimatum: pay back the money or he would complain to Ridgeway’s bosses at Shaw and Partners. Ridgeway panicked and tried to convince Jason not to complain due to fear of the consequences. Jason, however, ran out of patience and filed an official complaint. He describes the process as starting from scratch, going back to 2015, and realizing the magnitude of the crime. He felt compelled to seek help from the police.\n\n\nThe segment concludes with Ridgeway’s scam being exposed, along with the true extent of his greed. His wife and children were also involved. The final scene shows Ridgeway walking in a park, his face etched with concern. The segment ends with Ridgeway’s wife expressing her desire for him to stop hiding and lying.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.17328803,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16776322},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20561528,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.29098046},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20181336,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1510279},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08632375,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13386764}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1338,"promptTokenCount":801787,"totalTokenCount":803125}}}

She then reports on a paparazzi clash involving Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who demanded a photo agency hand over its images after an alleged paparazzi chase in New York. The agency refused, stating that the images are their property. Next, the news anchor introduces a segment on luxury living, featuring a family mansion in Middle Dural. The segment shows the exterior and interior of the mansion, including the pool, tennis court, bedrooms, bathrooms, wellness retreat, cinema, and kitchen. The homeowner, Martina Jutrisa, is interviewed about the design of the home. A real estate agent, William Brush, is also interviewed about the property's value and potential to break records. The news anchor then reports on the promising results of a new drug for alopecia, a hair loss condition. The drug is shown to have positive results in a trial of 700 patients. Finally, the news anchor reports on the future of Campbelltown, a bustling southwest city. Stakeholders are meeting to map out a plan for more jobs and high rises to meet the demands of a booming population. The report identifies manufacturing and healthcare as major growth industries. Several major projects are set to boost employment and housing, including the derelict Brands on Sale mall in the CBD, an eight-story commercial building in the heart of the CBD, and the $42 million Billabong Parklands. Construction will begin on MacArthur Gardens in the next few months. The news anchor then introduces a segment on winter savings, followed by a segment on cheaper airfares. Finally, the news anchor reports on the son of former New South Wales Liberal leader Kerry Chikarovski being charged over an alleged multi-million dollar drug operation. The son, Mark Chikarovski, is accused of running a dark web marketplace where he sold drugs and delivered them through Australia Post post boxes. He was arrested and released on bail for half a million dollars.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Street with police officers investigating a car accident\",\n      \"News studio\",\n      \"Soccer stadium in the Netherlands\",\n      \"Street in New York City\",\n      \"Family mansion in Middle Dural, Australia\",\n      \"House in Logan, Australia\",\n      \"Waverley Court House, Australia\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Crime\",\n      \"Real estate\",\n      \"Health\",\n      \"Urban development\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"James Wilson (reporter)\",\n      \"Wilson (arrested man)\",\n      \"Prince Harry\",\n      \"Meghan Markle\",\n      \"Martina Jutrisa (homeowner)\",\n      \"William Brush (real estate agent)\",\n      \"Kerry Chikarovski (former New South Wales Liberal leader)\",\n      \"Mark Chikarovski (son of Kerry Chikarovski)\",\n      \"Brett Huxstep (witness)\",\n      \"Josh Bavas (reporter)\",\n      \"Sophie Upcroft (reporter)\",\n      \"Tim Lawless (CoreLogic)\",\n      \"Kate Berger (alopecia patient)\",\n      \"Elizabeth Bryan (reporter)\",\n      \"Alexander Wendler (Landcom CEO)\",\n      \"George Greiss (Campbelltown Mayor)\",\n      \"Bianca Balzer (reporter)\",\n      \"Matt Craft (NSW Police State Command Cybercrime)\"\n    ],\n    \"BrandsCompanyNamesLogos\": [\n      \"GANT\",\n      \"West Ham\",\n      \"9 News\",\n      \"LJ Hooker\",\n      \"CoreLogic\",\n      \"Qantas\",\n      \"NSW Police Force\",\n      \"Crime Stoppers\",\n      \"Australia Post\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.122523345,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1623801},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.32509217,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.39094135},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.16885665,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18713295},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12085322,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15817478}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1029,"promptTokenCount":799723,"totalTokenCount":800752}}}

She dives into the pool and swims underwater. \\n\\nThe narrator says, \\\"Even as a little girl, Ariarne Titmus had an uncanny understanding of her true destiny. On top of that, she had the maturity to realize the only way to reach it was to leave the place she loved.\\\"\\n\\nThe woman is shown swimming in a pool, then swimming in a competition with a yellow swim cap.

Just ask Giancarlo Granda. He was only 20 years old, working as a hotel pool attendant, when a woman invited him back to her room to attend to her. Giancarlo didn't know it at first, but this was to be a three-way tryst. He also didn't realize his new friends, a married couple, were two of the biggest names in America's evangelical movement. In fact, the husband, Jerry Falwell Jr., was also a political kingmaker who helped Donald Trump win the presidency in 2016. But the biggest surprise was the god-awful mess created when this humble hotel employee tried to expose the rank hypocrisy of these religious zealots.\\\"\\n\\nFootage of a pool party at a hotel is shown. \\n\\nA man in a blue polo shirt is speaking in an interview setting. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Miami Beach, Florida, is a renowned party playground, and smack bang in the middle of the action is the luxury Fontainebleau Hotel.

People are, you know, people are there for a reason.\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Giancarlo Granda knows all about the atmosphere poolside at the thousand-dollar-a-night hotel. He worked there as an attendant, setting up cabanas and bringing guests drinks. It was a fun and flirtatious workplace.\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the blue polo shirt is shown again in the interview setting. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Was there a sense that a lot of people had eyed you off and said, 'He's not a bad-looking boy'?\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Yeah, especially when I was 20 years old. I was in pretty good shape. You know, I, yeah, I'd get some compliments. And there was one woman who really took things to the next level.\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the blue polo shirt is shown again in the interview setting. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"So, yeah, I mean, this woman, she did stand out because she was just eyeing me down.\\\"\\n\\nFootage of a man running in front of the US Capitol building is shown. \\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"It was poolside at Miami's Fontainebleau Hotel in 2012 where it all began. When Giancarlo was being hit on by a hotel guest called Becky. And I noticed that she was taking pictures of me, which is kind of unusual. We started chatting. She told me, you know, 'Don't waste your time with the younger ones. They don't know what they're doing.'\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the blue polo shirt is shown again in the interview setting. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"What did you take that to mean?\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"You know, as a 20-year-old, I'm like, 'Huh, you know, that caught my attention there.' And I realized that, you know, she was obviously flirting with me, and we just started talking from there. And so I, I think things escalated pretty quickly. Didn't they?\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the blue polo shirt is shown again in the interview setting. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Yeah, it did escalate pretty quickly. Um, so towards the end of the shift, um, after we were flirting for a few hours, she made a proposition. She's like, 'Do you want to go back to my hotel room?' And obviously, as a 20-year-old, you know, single 20-year-old, I'm like, 'Yeah, let's, I would love to.'\\\"\\n\\nFootage of a hotel room is shown. \\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Becky hired a new hotel room for the catch-up. But it turned out there was more to this steamy rendezvous than a nervous Giancarlo had bargained for.\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the blue polo shirt is shown again in the interview setting. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Well, caught me off guard was that she told me her husband wanted to watch. And immediately, I just, I kind of pulled back. I was about to say no. Internally, I was telling myself, 'This is weird, definitely not.' But she told me that, you know, 'Don't worry about it. He's not going to, he's not going to do anything. He's just going to sit in the corner and just watch.'\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"And just so it's clear, when he was there, what was he doing?\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the blue polo shirt is shown again in the interview setting. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Uh, when he was there, obviously, the audience is wondering what was he doing in the corner. And, so he was, he was masturbating, you know. He was masturbating in the corner.\\\"\\n\\nFootage of a hotel room is shown. \\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"At first, Giancarlo wrote the night off as some wild one-off experience for a 20-year-old. Yet, he was shocked when Becky followed up, wanting more action, and suggested the hotel worker go on a holiday with she and her husband. This is where Becky just dropped a love bomb on me. You know, she's like, 'I love you.' And this is just a couple of weeks after meeting her, and I thought that was unusual. And at that point, I'm like, 'How many people do you do this with?' But an even bigger shock came when Giancarlo Googled the names of the husband and wife he was tangled up with. He was Jerry Falwell Jr., high-profile president of Liberty University, America's largest evangelical college. All of a sudden, this humble pool attendant realized the moral hypocrisy of the married couple he'd been hooking up with. Not only was Jerry a prominent voice in conservative politics, he was also the son of famous televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr. The patriarch was the founder of Liberty University, but better known for outrageous religious proclamations, including blaming the September 11 terror attacks on minority groups.\\\"\\n\\nA man with a beard, wearing a black turtleneck and blue jeans, is sitting in a chair in a room. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"How would you describe the moral compass of Liberty University?\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Liberty University's moral compass, you know, spins like a, like a top. What Liberty's leaders have done is, is sort of hijack, um, key parts of, of the Christian faith and use them, uh, to, to validate a political agenda and to make themselves rich. And nothing could be more offensive to Christianity than that.\\\"\\n\\nFootage of a man running in front of the US Capitol building is shown. \\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Dustin Wald is a former student at Liberty University who founded a group trying to reform the college's hardline agenda, both in terms of morality on campus and external political influence.\\\"\\n\\nThe man with a beard is shown again in the room. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Seems like it's almost impossible not to link Liberty University with the Falwell family, and then in turn almost impossible to not associate the Falwells with politics.\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"That's exactly right. The, the Falwells are, are inseparable from the school. Both Falwells, uh, saw their, uh, role at Liberty as a, um, as a largely political one, if not primarily political.\\\"\\n\\nFootage of a man driving a car is shown. \\n\\nThe man in the suit is shown again in the studio. \\n\\nHe says, \\\"Now fully aware of who he was cavorting with, Giancarlo Granda was feeling increasingly uncomfortable about his ongoing tryst with Becky and Jerry Falwell Jr. Not only that, he now had a girlfriend his own age. Yet, Giancarlo claims that when he broke the news to Becky that he wanted out of their unusual relationship, he felt she tried to blackmail him.\\\"\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.123365745,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15203233},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14033636,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.22270027},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.23510863,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19436789},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.30239138,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3876911}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":2596,"promptTokenCount":833648,"totalTokenCount":836244}}}

Fleming's rampage was described as terrifying, but not the work of a terrorist. The Supreme Court ruled that Fleming's actions were those of a man who belongs in a hospital, not prison. Fleming's solicitor, Aaron Kernaghan, stated that Fleming felt heard for the first time. The incident occurred 18 months prior when Fleming, dressed in combat black and armed with a rifle, gel blaster, and fake bomb, took two men hostage inside a Windang dive shop. A USB drive found after Fleming's surrender contained plans for a similar outburst, threatening to make the Cronulla riots look like a kindergarten field trip. Fleming, 41, pleaded not guilty, arguing he had no understanding of his actions due to schizophrenia. The crown case collapsed after evidence from a right-wing extremist expert was thrown out. The judge ordered the jury to clear Fleming of the terrorism charge. Eleven other firearm and kidnap offenses will be dealt with on mental health grounds. Fleming's family will take action against the DPP to cover their legal bill.\\n\\nThe next news segment reports on a car and motorcycle collision on Warringah Road at Forestville, causing chaos during morning peak hour. Two of three westbound lanes were shut down, but no one was seriously injured.\\n\\nThe following segment focuses on the fallout from the tasering of 95-year-old great-grandmother Clare Nowland. The police officer who tasered her inside her Cooma nursing home has been suspended with full pay. Nowland's family remains by her side in the hospital. A worker at Yallambee Lodge, where the incident occurred, has received death threats. Senior Constable Christian White, the officer involved, has been suspended with full pay. He is a local officer with 12 years of experience. Police initially withheld crucial details but later stated that Nowland was approaching police with a knife. Nowland's family released a statement expressing their profound love and affection for her and thanking Cooma and the world for the outpouring of support.\\n\\nThe next segment discusses Premier Chris Minns being accused of class warfare over his stamp duty reforms for first home buyers. Buyers entering the market will pay no stamp duty on homes up to $800,000 under legislation put before state parliament. The legislation will also scrap a scheme offering a choice of paying an upfront lump sum or a lower annual fee on homes up to $1.5 million.\\n\\nThe next segment reports on Qantas announcing a record underlying profit of close to $2.5 billion for this financial year, almost $1 billion higher than its previous record in 2018. The Transport Workers Union is unimpressed, calling on the airline to pay back the $2.7 billion in taxpayer support received during the pandemic. Michael Kaine, of the Transport Workers Union, criticizes the profit, attributing it to corporate welfare, illegal sacking of 1,700 workers, high airfares, and low service standards.\\n\\nThe next segment focuses on Australian athletes preparing for the Paris Olympics. They road-tested uniforms, hoping to propel them to gold medal glory. Cycling legend Anna Meares will be Australia's Chef de Mission in Paris. The Nine Network has added the Paralympics to its Olympics broadcast. Ellie Cole, Paralympic champion, emphasizes the importance of inclusivity in sports.\\n\\nThe final segment reports on a miracle on the M4 where two police officers escaped injury after a truck slammed into the back of their patrol car at Merrylands. The officers were talking to the driver of a Toyota Land Cruiser they had just pulled over when the semi-trailer crashed into their vehicle. The 29-year-old truck driver has been fined for negligent driving.\\n\\nThe segment also covers a water main explosion on the Northern Beaches at Manly Vale, which did not cause any traffic problems.\\n\\nA senior investigator in the Bruce Lehrmann case said police were worried about bringing him before the court due to a perceived lack of evidence.

Law enforcement officers all around the world see very similar traits in the crooks they arrest. Greed, arrogance, and more often than not, high levels of stupidity. It's certainly the case for Isabelle Lagace and Melina Roberge. Blinded by the promise of a small fortune along with a free luxury cruise from England to Australia, they agreed to help smuggle 95 kilograms of cocaine in their luggage. And as they happily or idiotically revealed on Instagram, they thought being a drug mule was as easy as getting a South Pacific suntan. But then, Border Force arranged a special welcome party for their arrival.\\\" The scene changes to the woman in the room.

She says, \\\"She's also very open, which goes some way to understanding why she's agreed to this interview for a Canadian documentary. It might also explain how she got caught up in the drug trade in the first place, although she puts it down to simple greed.\\\" The scene changes to the woman walking down a city street at night. She says, \\\"It was purely financial. I accepted the trip because there was money in the end for me if the plan was well executed.\\\" The scene changes to a map showing the route of the cruise ship. The scene changes to the cruise ship docked in Sydney Harbor. The scene changes to the woman in the room. She says, \\\"The plan seemed simple enough.

The scene changes to the inside of the cruise ship. The scene changes to an older couple sitting in a room. The man says, \\\"Barry and Nerida Rowe also got on the Sea Princess in Dover. They'd booked the 49-day round-the-world trip to celebrate Barry's retirement. Despite being avid cruisers, they had no idea they were about to get caught up in a scandal on the high seas. But they did know something wasn't quite right when they first came across Isabelle Lagace. We were on level five. Coffee shop's on level five. The girls were on level five. So I would go out, have a cup of tea around 11:00 and that's where I bumped into Isabelle. I said, 'What are you doing on this cruise?' And she said, 'I did not do my research.' And I said, 'No, you didn't.'\\\" The scene changes to the woman in the room. She says, \\\"If anyone knows how to spot a drug smuggler, it's Superintendent Graeme Campbell. Over a 36-year career with the Australian Border Force, he's tracked down all kinds of crooks in the process of protecting our country. And back in 2016, he was put in charge when a tip-off came through about the Sea Princess. We received some information from overseas sources that there was some unusual passenger movement on board that vessel. We had reason to believe that they presented a threat and we were monitoring their movements.\\\" The scene changes to a montage of Instagram photos of the two women. The scene changes to the man in the police uniform speaking in a dark room. He says, \\\"Not that it was particularly difficult. Isabelle and Melina did nothing to hide their presence on the cruise. They didn't even attempt a low profile. And every time the cruise stopped at a new port, there was a new opportunity to boast about their trip. Using social media as an online travel journal, they posted photos of their adventures everywhere from Ireland to Columbia.\\\" The scene changes to the woman in the room.

The scene then shifts to a montage of Sheridan in various roles, including a distressed scene where he is tearing up sheet music. The narrative shifts to Sheridan's personal life, discussing intense speculation about his private life. The scene changes to Sheridan walking down a staircase with a woman in a red top and white pants. They are at NIDA, Sydney's famed acting school, where Sheridan was a student. The narrator mentions that Sheridan was attracted to both men and women during his time at NIDA but was advised to keep his sexuality quiet for the sake of his career. Sheridan recalls being told by two teachers that if he revealed his sexuality, he would never get any work. He notes the irony that both teachers were openly gay themselves. The video then shows a collage of images of Sheridan, highlighting his public image. The narrator states that Sheridan's sexuality was more fluid than people thought. After his first male relationship ended, he started dating a woman again. The video returns to Sheridan's interview, where he discusses his decision to publicly address rumors about his sexuality. He explains that he always enjoyed hearing from past NIDA students about their experiences in the industry. He felt it was time to share his own story. The video shows a Stellar magazine cover featuring Sheridan with the headline \\\"Packed to the Rafters' Hugh Sheridan addresses rumors about sexuality.\\\" The narrator says that Sheridan wrote a heartfelt essay explaining the difficulty he had in labeling himself. The interview resumes, and Sheridan is asked what he declared in his essay. He responds that he doesn't need to know all the answers and that he still doesn't have answers to a lot of things. He adds that he is fine with that. The interviewer asks if Sheridan put a label on himself in his writing. He replies that he did, \\\"human,\\\" but that if she is referring to other labels, he was too scared to clarify at the time. He explains that when he was overseas, headlines labeled him as non-binary and gave him they/them pronouns, which he never used for himself. He identifies as he/him and clarifies that he never said he was non-binary, but he let people call him whatever they wanted. The interviewer asks why Sheridan labeled himself bisexual in his essay. He responds that it was another label and that he likes both men and women. He felt it was important to be honest in the article and say how he felt. He acknowledges that there are many new labels now and that he hasn't found one that fits him perfectly. The video then shows a collage of photos of Rafael De La Fuente, Sheridan's former husband. The interviewer asks if Sheridan was married. He confirms that he was, for nine years. The interviewer expresses surprise that the marriage was kept secret. Sheridan explains that the story broke when he got engaged to someone else. He says that some people expressed disbelief about the rumors, but he confirms that he was married. He adds that he had been engaged before as well. He didn't feel like his marriage was something that needed to be discussed publicly, and he didn't feel like he was lying or being secretive. He also wanted to protect his former partner's privacy. The interviewer asks Sheridan if it's ever acceptable to sacrifice someone for a bigger political point. Sheridan replies that there are things people do that are not acceptable, specifically going out of one's way to hurt or segregate others. He shifts the conversation back to acting, saying that people play different characters and that doesn't mean they are those people in real life. He adds that he would like to see more transgender people playing roles that align with their transitioned gender. The narrator says that Sheridan believed he had won and was then cruelly denied a once-in-a-lifetime role. He thought he would never again be offered such a demanding part. However, he was wrong. The video shows Sheridan in the play \\\"Tick, Tick... Boom!\\\" and highlights his performance. The interviewer asks if \\\"Tick, Tick... Boom!\\\" is Sheridan's silver lining to being canceled. He responds that the play is a joy for him and that he loves the story because it's about determination and courage. He gets to tell that story every day, even though it can be tough and people might try to bring him down. He concludes by saying, \\\"What a way to spend the day.\\\" The video ends with the 60 Minutes logo and contact information for Lifeline, a crisis support service. The 60 Minutes team is shown, and the program concludes.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Stage performance\",\n      \"NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art)\",\n      \"Interview setting\",\n      \"Theater stage\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Sexuality\",\n      \"Privacy\",\n      \"Career\",\n      \"Cancel culture\",\n      \"Representation\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Hugh Sheridan\",\n      \"Rafael De La Fuente\",\n      \"Tara Brown\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12852527,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19314747},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.10970578,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.11920304599999999},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1968261,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18594724},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.26740846,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20055786}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1135,"promptTokenCount":843088,"totalTokenCount":844223}}}

He is wearing the same dark blue polo shirt. He says that the woman texted him a still image from a video of him in a hotel room. He didn't know he was being recorded and didn't consent to it.

I think we know.\\\" The man in the suit continues, \\\"Yes, so there's that one, but he said so many things about other minority groups as well. Were their eyebrows raised that this was the kind of man that an evangelical church wanted to endorse as the president?\\\" The man in the black turtleneck replies, \\\"There were some eyebrows raised, but not enough. Falwell Jr. stood by Trump's side all throughout that and said that there was nothing Trump could say that would keep him from getting Falwell Jr.'s support.\\\" The man in the suit asks, \\\"Did Donald Trump align with Christian values in your mind?\\\" The man in the black turtleneck replies, \\\"There's nothing about Donald Trump or Trumpism that is reflected in Christianity.\\\" \\n\\nThe scene changes to show Donald Trump walking down a staircase, followed by his family.

Text messages between the two appear on the screen, saying, \\\"That's yesterday's news\\\" and \\\"When you came over to me at the hotel…\\\" \\n\\nTom Arnold continues speaking, saying, \\\"There's a bunch of photographs, you know, personal photographs that somehow the guy ended up getting. Whether it was off Jerry's phone or somehow maybe it got air dropped or whatever the hell the whole thing was. Even though she's a very nice figure, um, you know, nobody wants that. You know, they're private photos.\\\" He continues, \\\"And Michael Cohen went to him and said, 'Hey, Jerry, the naked pictures of your wife, etcetera. Well, I still got one of the pictures. And I need you to do me a favor for my boss. It'll really make me look good if you support him, support Donald Trump.' And that's the reason, you know, it was payback for the naked pictures.\\\" \\n\\nThe reporter asks if he ever saw them himself. Tom Arnold replies, \\\"Yes. The picture was very, very, very, very intimate post-lovemaking picture. And whatever you take that as. That's all I can say on your network.\\\" \\n\\nThe scene changes to show Tom Arnold driving a car. The reporter says that, critically at the time, Tom Arnold also became aware the Falwells had struck an unusual business deal with a young man they met at a hotel in Miami by the name of Giancarlo Granda. \\n\\nThe scene changes to aerial views of Miami Beach, showing hotels and the ocean. The scene then changes to show Giancarlo Granda walking down a sidewalk in front of a building.

So immediately he was turned off by him. He doesn't think Trump should be the representative of the United States. He doesn't think Trump should have the nuclear codes. \\n\\nThe scene changes to show a crowd of people waving American flags and cheering. Donald Trump is speaking at a podium in front of them. The scene then changes back to Giancarlo Granda, who says that the Falwells definitely manipulated him. He feels like he was used. It was a very dark chapter in his life. \\n\\nThe man in the suit appears again, speaking to someone off-camera. He says that dark is almost a kind way of describing it.

The scene then transitions to the \\\"In Too Deep\\\" graphic again. \\n\\nThe scene changes to a close-up of the \\\"60 Minutes\\\" clock. The scene then changes to show Giancarlo Granda boxing with a trainer in a ring.

Nowadays, keeping active is critical in him staying in control of his mental health. But four years ago, he was spiraling, living in a seemingly inescapable nightmare of a controlling sexual and business relationship with Becki and Jerry Falwell Jr. \\n\\nThe scene changes to show a photograph of Jerry and Becki Falwell on a dock with another person. The reporter asks Giancarlo Granda if he thinks the Falwells are predators. Giancarlo Granda replies, \\\"Right, so like, you know, groom… whenever someone says 'groom' me, you think of like, oh, it has to be like a kid or something. But no, I believe anyone could be groomed for anything, right? Especially if you hold power over them.\\\" He believes that they manipulated him. He feels like he was used. \\n\\nThe scene changes to show Jerry and Becki Falwell on stage again, this time with another man. Jerry is speaking into a microphone.

The woman asks if they can turn things around or if it's toast. The man is unsure. The scene shifts to a cityscape, then to a shirtless man ironing clothes. A narrator says Caitlin and Shannon remain in separate apartments after an eye-gazing task during intimacy week. Shannon realizes Caitlin is not the woman he envisioned. Shannon tells Caitlin he thought she would blow him away, but she didn't. He says he wouldn't have even contemplated saying what she said; he would have just cut it off. Caitlin is seen crying in an elevator. She says the past week with Shannon has been horrendous. The person she has seen this past week is not someone she wants to be in a relationship with, and it has taken her by surprise. She feels she has been nothing but awkward to him and couldn't have done anything more. She says she needs to be assertive and hold him to accountability because he has not treated her like a human, let alone a human he is married to. She is appalled and disgusted and will not sit down and take it anymore. She is going to show him that she is a strong woman and is not there to play games because she deserves better. The scene transitions to the commitment ceremony set. Three experts are seated on a brown leather couch. The men and women enter separately and take their seats on couches facing the experts. The expert in the middle welcomes everyone to the second commitment ceremony. He emphasizes the importance of these moments for their overall progress and says the questions will get harder and they will dig deeper to get to the bottom of what is going on in their relationships. He says no one will get away from this commitment ceremony without taking accountability. He mentions the dinner party the previous night was very polarizing and tonight they will get to the bottom of things and look at their behavior in great detail. The first couple called up is Jesse and Claire. One of the female experts comments that this is a very different couple and asks if they have actually met this pair. Claire introduces herself and her husband, Jesse. The expert says she really liked what Jesse said earlier in the experiment, that he needed to take charge so Claire could take to the stage and be her full self. But then he said he resented her for that. Jesse says he normally wouldn't have said anything, but he forced himself to contribute. The expert says they are now seeing his true, authentic self with her. The female expert asks Jesse how he would describe the feelings he is starting to develop for Claire. Jesse laughs and says he likes her. Claire says she is really enjoying being in Jesse's company, their humor, and the connection they have built. She is hoping to explore that with more challenges and as they progress. The female expert asks if they have kissed. Claire says not yet. The expert asks why not. Claire says she is physically attracted to Jesse. The expert asks Jesse if he is physically attracted to Claire. Jesse laughs and says yes. The expert says she loves the enthusiasm and anticipation. Claire says she hopes they can have their first kiss sometime this week. The experts say they won't be complaining if that happens. The experts wish them a great week. Claire says she is proud of the progress they have made, that they have taken the experts' advice, put it into motion, and is excited for the week ahead. Jesse agrees. The female expert says this week is all about that connection, going deeper, and if the first kiss happens this week, they won't be complaining. The next couple called up is Bronte and Harrison. Bronte says it has been an interesting week, a bit of a 180 from both of them. Harrison says that on the back of the last commitment ceremony, things weren't great for them. At the time, he felt he wasn't seeing the best side of Bronte. To Bronte's credit, she came and apologized and made amends, which was an opportunity for him to show acceptance and forgiveness. The female expert asks what changed for Bronte.

The officer has been charged with recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault. The officer will appear at the Cooma Local Court on Wednesday, July 5th. Webb confirms that the Nowland family has been informed of the charges, and their thoughts and prayers are with Mrs. Nowland and her family. Webb thanks the detectives who worked around the clock on the case. A reporter asks Webb how hard the past week has been for her, given accusations that the police were covering up the incident. Webb reiterates that it has been a proper process and that the investigation has been fair and not prejudiced. She is confident that the matter is now before the court without interference. Another reporter asks about the decision to suspend the officer. Webb explains that in New South Wales, a person is innocent until proven guilty, and the officer is afforded the same opportunity as any other resident. His employment will continue to be reviewed, but he remains suspended. A reporter asks if the charges could be upgraded. Webb says it is possible, depending on what happens. Another reporter asks about the morale of the force. Webb acknowledges that the incident has been traumatic for everyone in the police force, but the rest of the force continues to do their job protecting and looking after the citizens of New South Wales. A reporter asks why bodycam footage has not been released. Webb says she is not the investigator. Another reporter asks how the police force will move forward regarding its reputation. Webb states that thousands of officers do the right thing every day, and it only takes one incident to make the news. \\n\\nThe news segment ends, and the weather forecast begins.

She mentions that marrying a stranger wouldn't surprise her family and friends because finding a partner is a driving force for her. She then reveals some personal information to Hugo, stating that she can be explosive and her biggest trigger is the thought of her partner not defending her in public, even if they don't agree with her words and actions. She clarifies that she's happy to have private discussions if there are disagreements, but she needs her partner to stand by her publicly. She also mentions her issue with authority and dislike of being told what to do, expressing her hope that, as her husband, Hugo won't presume to tell her what to do.

He promises to make her smile every day, be in her corner no matter what (unless she does something super sketchy), pick her up when she falls over (or maybe fall down with her), order something different for her when they eat out so they can swap if they don't like their own dishes, hate whoever they need to hate that week, and dance with her even when the music is over. Joking aside, he tells Tayla that he believes people are the product of their relationships, be it family, friends, or partners, and he hopes to make her feel safe, special, and desired, and most importantly, loved.\n\n\nTayla, listening to Hugo's vows, smiles and laughs. The guests also react positively, with some laughing and others smiling. After Hugo finishes his vows, Tayla says they were really sweet and what she wanted to hear, especially his promise to be in her corner. She admits it was strange but nice to hear. The officiant then pronounces them husband and wife. The guests applaud and cheer as Tayla and Hugo kiss. They walk down the aisle together, hand in hand, smiling at the cheering guests.\n\n\nThe scene changes to the wedding reception, where Tayla and Hugo are seated at the head table. The guests are seated at round tables decorated with flowers and candles. The newlyweds are introduced, and the guests applaud. In a separate interview, a guest expresses her feelings about the wedding, saying she feels like she wants to sink into her chair and feels like she has let Jesse down, but she has no one to blame but herself. She expresses her uncertainty about how Jesse will react but thinks he will be gutted.\n\n\nThe scene shifts to another wedding, where Evelyn and Rupert are about to get married. Rupert is shown getting ready in a hotel room, buttoning his suit jacket and looking at the wedding ring in its box. Evelyn is shown getting ready in her apartment, showing her wedding dress to her mother and sister. They compliment her on how beautiful she looks. Evelyn asks her mother if the dress is too sexy, and her mother replies that it looks good on her. Evelyn then steps out onto the balcony.\n\n\nThe scene transitions to the wedding venue, where guests are arriving and taking their seats. The venue is decorated with flowers and candles. Rupert arrives in a car and walks nervously toward the venue. He expresses his nervousness about delivering his vows and speech, hoping he won't crack under pressure. He enters the venue and walks down the aisle.\n\n\nThe scene cuts to the guests seated at tables, waiting for the ceremony to begin. Evelyn's mother asks if the man walking down the aisle is the best man, and someone corrects her, saying it's the groom. Evelyn's mother then drops the rings, causing some amusement among the guests. Rupert retrieves the rings and continues down the aisle. The officiant begins the ceremony.\n\n\nThe scene then shifts to another couple, Tahnee and Ollie, who are sitting outside at night, surrounded by twinkling lights. They are introduced as a couple. The scene then returns to Rupert's wedding, where he drops the rings again, causing more laughter among the guests. He retrieves the rings and the ceremony continues.\n\n\nThe final scenes show highlights of the various weddings, including the couples walking down the aisle, guests applauding, and the couples kissing.\n\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Rooftop with buildings\",\n      \"Wedding ceremony venue\",\n      \"Rooftop with cityscape\",\n      \"Wedding reception venue\",\n      \"Hotel room\",\n      \"Apartment\",\n      \"Wedding venue\",\n      \"Outdoor setting with twinkling lights\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Wedding\",\n      \"Relationships\",\n      \"Vows\",\n      \"Nerves\",\n      \"Humor\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Hugo\",\n      \"Tayla\",\n      \"Taylor\",\n      \"Evelyn\",\n      \"Rupert\",\n      \"Tahnee\",\n      \"Ollie\",\n      \"Jesse\",\n      \"Adam\",\n      \"Janelle\",\n      \"Claire\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09401007,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.105210766},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.10374877,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16132025},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12852527,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16451685},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.4082763,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.37113687}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1428,"promptTokenCount":1225703,"totalTokenCount":1227131}}}

A male reporter asks her what it's like playing for the royals. The woman responds that they are great and wonderful. She has played for King Charles many times and was invited to St. James's Palace to play for his dinner parties. The reporter jokes that King Charles can call her up and put on a big show, unlike the reporter, who would put on a Spotify playlist. The woman laughs and says that King Charles loves live music. She reveals that King Charles is a big classical music fan and that he needs it in his life. He once told her at Buckingham Palace that classical music keeps him sane, calms him, and grounds him. The reporter jokingly suggests that the woman is the key to the king's sanity, which she humorously accepts. The scene shifts to a choir singing in a church, with the woman playing the violin alongside them. The reporter describes the music as a beautiful soundtrack to a day the king will never forget. \\n\\nThe scene changes to the woman walking in a park, expressing her joy at having one of the best days of her life. She excitedly recounts seeing various celebrities, including Joanna Lumley, Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry, and Boris Johnson. She reflects on how the music transcended the occasion itself, making her proud to be there. The scene then shows a procession of horses and carriages, with flags from various Commonwealth countries lining the route. King Charles and Camilla are seen in the golden carriage, waving to the crowds. \\n\\nThe scene cuts to an interview between the reporter and a man named Charles Brandreth, sitting at a table with tea and pastries. Brandreth states that no one in the history of the British monarchy has come to the throne better prepared than King Charles. The scene briefly shows a man, Scott Furssedonn-Wood, getting ready and receiving an invitation to the coronation. He expresses his privilege at being part of history and acknowledges the significance of the event. He mentions telling his father, who watched Queen Elizabeth II's coronation on a tiny rented television screen, about his invitation. He adds that his father never expected his son to be in Westminster Abbey for a coronation. \\n\\nThe scene returns to the interview with Scott Furssedonn-Wood, who describes his role as King Charles's representative as Britain's High Commissioner designate to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. He recalls spending four years traveling the world with Charles when he was his deputy private secretary. He shares a story about King Charles sending a long, handwritten letter and flowers to his mother in the hospital when she was ill with cancer, highlighting the king's thoughtful nature. He emphasizes that this is just one small example of the king's kindness. He also mentions that his mother never met King Charles. The reporter points out that many people see the king's stoic public face, but Furssedonn-Wood has seen his big heart. Furssedonn-Wood agrees, adding that the king is genuine and believes that connection is crucial for the monarchy's relevance. \\n\\nThe scene cuts back to Brandreth, who describes King Charles as a workaholic, recalling an instance where the Queen took him to Charles's study, which was piled high with paperwork. He says that Charles and Camilla are infatuated with each other, unlike Elizabeth and Philip, who were not. He quotes Duveen, who said that love consists not necessarily in gazing into one another's eyes, but in looking in the same direction. He emphasizes that Charles and Camilla complement each other and work tremendously well as a team. The reporter asks Brandreth about the significance of the coronation being scaled back. Brandreth explains that it was partly due to the king's sensitivity to the cost of living crisis and the desire to avoid extravagance. He mentions a tension between the public's desire for a spectacle and the king's wish to be thrifty. \\n\\nThe scene shifts to a protest with people holding signs saying \\\"Not My King\\\". The reporter notes that not everyone is celebrating the new king, particularly in Australia, where the republican movement is pushing to scrap the monarchy. Craig Foster, the new co-chair of the Australian Republican Movement, is introduced. He expresses excitement about seeing how Australia responds to the coronation and suggests that it's time for Australia to become a republic. Brandreth acknowledges the changing times and the growing movement for a republic within the Commonwealth. He concludes by reiterating that King Charles is the most prepared monarch in British history.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07055965,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.123365745},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06278917,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13477601},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.111241356,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.150029},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.124212936,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16559348}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1170,"promptTokenCount":823027,"totalTokenCount":824197}}}

The news transitions to a segment showing the lions being sedated and examined by zoo staff in a caged enclosure. A female zookeeper, Judy Wilson, is interviewed, explaining that lions hide pain in the wild to avoid showing weakness. The segment shows the lions receiving injections, having their teeth cleaned, and undergoing radiography using milk crates and 4x2 timber as makeshift equipment. The reporter interviews Dr. Kresen Pillay, a veterinarian at the Sydney Zoo, who explains the procedure and the challenges of moving the heavy lions. The lions are shown recovering from the anesthetic in their cages.

Tara Brown introduces the show and says that tonight, in a joint investigation with The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, they are going to expose a dubious global financial scheme that is happening right now. She says that hundreds of Australian families and thousands around the world are caught up in it, and that many victims don't know their life savings are missing. She says that the total losses could be in the millions of dollars. She says that one of the key players involved has decided to confess, and that after authorities hear what Chris Ridgeway has to say to reporter Adele Ferguson, a prison cell might be his next home.\\n\\nThe video then cuts to a man, Chris Ridgeway, getting into a black Porsche with the license plate \\\"RIDGYS.\\\" He drives off down a winding road through a forest. The video then cuts to an aerial shot of the road, with the Porsche driving along it. The video then cuts back to Chris Ridgeway driving the Porsche. The video then cuts to Chris Ridgeway sitting in a chair in a room. He is talking to Adele Ferguson. He says that he doesn't want to think of himself as a crook, but that some of his actions in recent times have been terribly unlawful. He says that he is ashamed and sorry. He says that he has no self-respect or self-worth and that he struggles to look at himself in the mirror.\\n\\nThe video then cuts to Chris Ridgeway walking down a set of stairs. He is wearing a suit. The video then cuts to an aerial shot of a city at night. The video then cuts back to Chris Ridgeway walking down a street. He is still wearing a suit. The video then cuts to Chris Ridgeway sitting in a chair in a room. He is talking to Adele Ferguson. He says that for years, he was employed at one of Australia's biggest and most reputable financial broking houses, Shaw and Partners. He says that he was a respected and trusted senior advisor, which made it easy for him to cheat his clients and friends out of their savings. He says that he wants people to believe he is a con with a conscience. He says that he hasn't done too much to make him a trustworthy person, but that he is here today because his life is at rock bottom. He says that he is trying to tell people he is sorry and that he is trying to be honest with himself.\\n\\nThe video then cuts to Adele Ferguson talking to the camera. She is standing in front of a blurry city background. She says that to prove his remorse, Chris Ridgeway has agreed to expose a global financial scheme that is still operating right now. She says that he has promised to tell the truth about his role in it, how his clients were impacted, and how many of them were left destitute. The video then cuts to a group of people sitting at a table in a room. Adele Ferguson is talking to them. One of the people says that it is catastrophic and that it affects what you can do, what you can't do, and the time you spend with your family. Another person says that it has had a massive impact on their overall life and that it has lost them their trust of the financial system. Adele Ferguson asks how big the scheme is, and one of the people says that they are looking at about $5.5 billion US. Adele Ferguson says that as viewers will see, people all around the world have been lured into the scheme, and that it's not only the loss of their savings that hurts, but also the embarrassment they feel because the truth was so simple. The video then cuts to Chris Ridgeway walking away from the camera. He is wearing a suit. The video then cuts back to Chris Ridgeway sitting in a chair in a room. He is talking to Adele Ferguson. He says that he knows that now, but that he didn't think that was the case when he started. Adele Ferguson asks if he honestly thinks he is a con now, and Chris Ridgeway says that he is pretty sure he is a con now. The video then cuts to Chris Ridgeway looking at a stock ticker. The video then cuts to two men, Andy Turner and David Sutton, standing next to each other. The video then cuts to David Sutton walking across a street. He is carrying a shopping bag.

The video then cuts back to Chris Ridgeway sitting in a chair in a room. He is talking to Adele Ferguson. He says that those two people are the ones they need to find out where the money has gone from. He says that they tried desperately to avoid phone calls and any contact with shareholders or anybody else. The video then cuts to Chris Ridgeway driving the Porsche down a winding road through a forest. The video then cuts to Chris Ridgeway sitting in a chair in a room. He is talking to Adele Ferguson. He says that Ridgeway says his role was as a middleman. He says that if he signed up investors to Turner and Sutton's scheme, he would be rewarded with lucrative secret kickbacks. He says that by pushing the lie that his employer, Shaw and Partners, endorsed the deals, his unsuspecting clients couldn't wait to sign up. The video then cuts to a montage of pictures of Chris Ridgeway and his family on vacation. Adele Ferguson says that it is illegal for financial advisors to take secret commissions, but that Ridgeway did it anyway. She says that he admits to taking $1.6 million in kickbacks, which he spent on flash cars and lavish overseas holidays. She says that his clients had no idea their savings were supporting his extravagant lifestyle. The video then cuts to a woman, Leeth Reynolds, sitting in a chair in a room. She is talking to Adele Ferguson. She says that Chris Ridgeway never said he was getting a commission. She says that it was never divulged and that it's not just a standard commission, but a massive commission that he was pocketing. She says that she guesses he gets paid well to do dodgy stuff. The video then cuts to Leeth Reynolds getting into a black Mazda. She drives off down a street. The video then cuts to Adele Ferguson talking to Leeth Reynolds. Leeth Reynolds says that unlike Chris Ridgeway's wheels, her car isn't about showing off. She says that she is supposed to be retired, but that thanks to her once trusted financial advisor, she needs it for work. Adele Ferguson asks if she anticipated that she would be couriering at this time, and Leeth Reynolds says no, that it definitely wasn't in her plan. The video then cuts to a picture of Chris Ridgeway at a funeral. Leeth Reynolds says that he was a close friend of her husband, Mark, and even a pallbearer when he died. She says that at that stage, he was very much a trusted member of their friendship group. She says that it's horrible to think he was grooming her from then, but that he would have been aware that she would have some sort of insurance payout. She says that he rang her and said, \\\"Are you sure you haven't got any more money? This is just such a good deal.\\\" She says that he told her he had invested his whole inheritance in it, and that he convinced her to transfer about $20,000 out of her super fund as well. She says that it wasn't full of money because being a stay-at-home mom, she mostly hadn't and wasn't exactly flush with money. Adele Ferguson says that he plundered it, and Leeth Reynolds says yes. The video then cuts to Leeth Reynolds making coffee in her kitchen. Adele Ferguson says that for a while, Leeth believed her investment was a winner. She says that regular communication, seemingly sent from Shaw and Partners, gave her that impression. The video then cuts to Leeth Reynolds walking down a street. She is wearing a red dress. The video then cuts back to Leeth Reynolds talking to Adele Ferguson. She says that Chris Ridgeway rang her and said, \\\"Are you sure you haven't got any more money? This is just such a good deal.\\\" She says that he told her he had invested his whole inheritance in it, and that he convinced her to transfer about $20,000 out of her super fund as well. She says that it wasn't full of money because being a stay-at-home mom, she mostly hadn't and wasn't exactly flush with money. Adele Ferguson says that he plundered it, and Leeth Reynolds says yes. The video then cuts to Leeth Reynolds looking at the buildings of Shaw and Partners. Adele Ferguson says that money was short, but Leeth handed over the last $20,000 from her late husband's life insurance. She says that that wasn't enough, however, for Ridgeway. She says that he told her he knew a stock that was about to list on an overseas exchange, and that if she got in early, she'd make a fortune. The video then cuts back to Leeth Reynolds talking to Adele Ferguson. She says that it wasn't like they'd met at a hotel somewhere over a beer, and he had said, \\\"Hey, I've got a good deal here.\\\" She says that she was in the office of a huge national company, a respected company, and that he was a senior advisor. She says that if you can't trust a senior advisor in a national company to help you with your finances, then who can you? She says that she clearly needed help.

He says that mice might be sneaky, persistent little devils, but fortunately, we humans are smarter. Australian scientists have come up with a clever way to beat the mouse plagues that have devastated so many farms across the country.\\n\\nThe video then shows footage of a farm. Two years ago, this wheat and canola farm southwest of Wagga was teeming with mice. The plague that ravaged eastern states costing grain growers $1 billion in New South Wales alone was devastating Peter Rayner's crops. Sydney University scientists carried out a world-first trial on Peter's wheat crop, warding off the rodents by manipulating their minds. Mice find their food through smell, sniffing and digging out seeds sown around 2 centimeters below the ground. By spraying the crop with an oil derived from wheat germ, scientists found they could camouflage the scent of the seeds. The results were startling, reducing the damage to crops by up to 74%. Mice eat around 100 seeds a day. So if you've got hundreds, if not thousands of them on a property, it's not hard to see how an entire crop can be wiped out. A similar treatment could be used on other crops, reducing the need for toxic pesticides. And with the oil made from a byproduct of the milling process, it's a safer and cheaper way to protect our precious food bowl.

The major report led by Sydney researchers found that the condition is more common among older people rather than working-age adults, and cases are higher among women compared to men. Low back pain is the leading cause of disability in the world.\\n\\nThe video then shows footage of a major search for Madeleine McCann. A big development in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. A major search is underway tonight at a dam in Portugal, not far from where the toddler went missing.

Portuguese and German police establishing a major operation at a reservoir, 50 kilometers from where Madeleine McCann went missing. The development in one of the world's most infamous missing persons cases driven by German investigators. They've previously named Christian Brueckner as their sole suspect, a man investigators claim frequented the reservoir and is currently in jail for raping a woman in Praia da Luz, where the British toddler vanished in 2007. UK detectives have traveled to Portugal to watch over the two-day search, the most significant operation in this case in nearly a decade. British police leading the last major search like this in 2014. Unofficial searches of the Barragem do Arade reservoir in 2008 uncovered nothing. This formal operation will focus on a two-kilometer stretch of water and woodland. A search for answers for Madeleine's parents, who this month marked what would have been her 20th birthday, saying they'll never give up.

It begins with an interview featuring Robert Potter, the boss of Australian cybersecurity and intelligence firm Internet 2.0. Potter reveals that TikTok collects more data than other social media apps, except for those built in Russia. He points out that TikTok’s claims about not collecting GPS location data or device IDs are false, as their analysis shows the app heavily collects both. Furthermore, TikTok stated they don't have any user data in China, but the analysis revealed regular connections to Chinese servers.\n\n\nThe segment then shifts to a visual representation of TikTok's data collection. A young woman walks in a park while using the app. Graphics illustrate how TikTok pinpoints her location, gathers biometric data from her face and voice, accesses her contacts, and monitors other apps running on her phone. The narrator emphasizes that this is only a small part of the data TikTok collects.\n\n\nThe segment returns to the interview, now with Potter in a different setting. He explains that TikTok can also collect keystroke patterns, body language, facial features, and access clipboard content, potentially including photos and passwords stored in the phone's memory. He notes that TikTok has expanded its data collection over time and now includes a super location field that tracks direction, speed, altitude, and precise coordinates.\n\n\nThe discussion then turns to the implications of TikTok’s data collection, particularly regarding China's national security laws. The segment includes an interview with Victor Gao, who argues that the West is being paranoid about TikTok and that data security is a legitimate concern that should be addressed through regulations rather than demonizing the company. He suggests that TikTok is an innovative company that deserves protection.\n\n\nThe segment then features an interview with Lee Hunter, TikTok’s boss in Australia. Hunter insists that the backlash against TikTok is politically motivated, not based on facts. He emphasizes TikTok’s commitment to user data safety, security, and privacy. However, the interviewer questions whether TikTok would comply if the Chinese government or intelligence agencies requested user data. Hunter asserts that they would not provide the data, but the interviewer counters that they would likely take it without asking. Hunter acknowledges the need for caution in working with China but maintains that TikTok is an entertainment platform, not a representative of China.\n\n\nThe segment concludes with a brief overview of the US government's efforts to address TikTok’s data collection practices, including the possibility of a ban unless ByteDance sells off TikTok. The segment highlights the potential far-reaching implications of this digital showdown. The host, Amelia Adams, then provides information on how to engage with the show on social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, before signing off.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Interview setting with dark background and bokeh\",\n      \"Park with paved path and trees\",\n      \"Interview setting with wooden wall and mirrors\",\n      \"Grand hall with staircase and people walking\",\n      \"Interview setting with dark background and light panels\",\n      \"TikTok office with neon sign and employees\",\n      \"US Congress hearing room\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"TikTok data collection practices\",\n      \"Concerns about Chinese government access to user data\",\n      \"National security implications\",\n      \"Debate over banning TikTok\",\n      \"TikTok's response to criticism\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Robert Potter\",\n      \"Victor Gao\",\n      \"Lee Hunter\",\n      \"Amelia Adams\",\n      \"Shou Chew\",\n      \"Mr. Joyce\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.111241356,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19193311},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.150029,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.26894155},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14608715,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1755382},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06954183,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.06097524}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":834,"promptTokenCount":801788,"totalTokenCount":802622}}}

Caitlin is surprised and delighted. Shannon presents her with a card and explains that he accidentally wrote the name Caitlin with an \\\"m\\\" instead of an \\\"n.\\\" Caitlin reads the card, which expresses Shannon's feelings and hopes for their relationship. Shannon then reveals the meal, which is a chicken parmigiana with chips and garlic bread. Caitlin expresses her excitement and appreciation for the gesture. They both enjoy the meal. After dinner, Shannon gives Caitlin another surprise, a small potted plant. He explains that the plant symbolizes their relationship, and he hopes it will blossom and flourish like their love. Caitlin is touched by the gesture. The scene shifts to another couple, Alessandro and Melinda. They are sitting on a couch and discussing their relationship.

The background is white and blue with curved lines.\\n\\nThe news anchor, Georgie Gardner, introduces the first story about a 95-year-old woman who was tasered by police in a nursing home. The woman was alone and carrying a knife at the time. She is now fighting for her life. Senior officers faced questions about the incident. Footage of the woman skydiving and celebrating with her family is shown. The nursing home, Yallambee Lodge, is shown. A man is interviewed and says that the incident is the talk of the town. A woman is interviewed and says that the police's course of action was unheard of. The NSW Police logo is shown. A police officer, Assistant Commissioner Peter Cotter, speaks at a press conference and says that police are very concerned about what occurred. He says that the woman was approaching police at a slow pace and had a walking frame, but she had a knife. He says that he has seen the footage and it is confronting. Another man is interviewed and says that it's a bit how you go how police can't disengage a 95-year-old lady. A woman, Nicole Lee, President of People with Disability Australia, is interviewed and says that there is no situation where using a taser on someone of this age and in this situation is ever going to be warranted. The news anchor says that the woman's family is bound to agree. \\n\\nEmma Partridge, Senior Crime Editor, joins the news anchor in the studio and gives more details about the officer involved. She says that the officer is a senior constable with 12 years of experience and his employment is under review. The Homicide Squad is leading a critical incident investigation. She says that Assistant Commissioner Peter Cotter was very forthcoming today when asked if the officer could face criminal charges. He said no one in the force is above the law and the senior constable's actions will be robustly scrutinized. She says that the woman remains in a critical condition with her family by her side at Cooma Hospital.\\n\\nThe news anchor introduces the next story about three schoolboys who were hit by a driver allegedly running a red light at Crows Nest. Dashcam footage of the incident is shown. The driver is seen stopping at a red light as school children with the green light begin to cross. The impact is too disturbing to show, but the reaction says it all. The silver Honda Accord drives away as people rush to the three children left badly injured on the roadway. One was 13, the other two 14 years old from nearby North Sydney Boys. The alleged hit-and-run driver, 18-year-old Vansh Khanna, an international student from India, is shown. He was arrested a short time after the incident at his home in nearby Lane Cove. He faced Manly Court today on seven charges, including failing to stop after an accident. Police opposed bail, fearing Khanna could flee the country, but the magistrate disagreed, noting it's likely he'll face a custodial sentence if convicted. Khanna was forced to hand over his passport and will have to report to police daily. The three boys he allegedly hit are in a stable condition and should fully recover from their injuries.\\n\\nThe news anchor introduces the next story about Anthony Albanese being in Japan for a high-stakes gathering of world leaders. The host city of Hiroshima is a symbolic choice for the G7, held against the backdrop of Russia's war in Ukraine. The hollowed-out dome of an industrial hall is shown, striking and somber. It is one of the few things still standing in Hiroshima from the atomic blast that helped end World War II. Anthony Albanese says that Australia is deeply committed to a world without nuclear weapons and he is personally very committed to that task. G7 leaders earlier handed wreaths at the Peace Park, a united front against recent nuclear threats from Russia. Anthony Albanese joined the expanded club of democracies for this weekend's summit. China was not invited as Xi Jinping hosts a summit of his own. But Beijing's assertiveness in the region is still front of mind in Japan. Charles Croucher, Political Editor, reports live from Hiroshima and says that in the last few hours, there have been reports that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on his way to the G7 Summit. It is a rare trip for the Ukrainian leader outside his country's borders. It is a message to Moscow. It all comes on the same day that Australia announced new sanctions on Russia, in particular on oil, on gold, and on steel producers in the country. Anthony Albanese tonight is saying that the Ukrainian people's struggle is the struggle for international law and that the world should stand with Ukraine.\\n\\nThe news anchor introduces the next story about police believing they have found the mother of a newborn baby found abandoned at Blacktown last month. Police have confirmed a woman has come forward and DNA testing is now underway. The baby girl was between one and three hours old when she was left on a chair on the patio of a stranger's home.\\n\\nThe news anchor introduces the next story about Justin Stein pleading not guilty to the murder of Charlise Mutten. Stein allegedly shot dead the nine-year-old and dumped her body in a barrel on the banks of the Colo River.

The narrator states that Ann is legally responsible for the mess. She sought help from the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) but received no assistance. Ann provided evidence, including photos, to the VBA, but they did not respond. In an interview, Ann expresses her frustration with the VBA's inaction, questioning their purpose and highlighting the cost to taxpayers. She states that she has lodged 14 complaints with the VBA over three years, but they have stonewalled her. The VBA considers the case closed, leaving Ann financially and emotionally devastated. \\n\\nThe video then transitions to Tamara Ralton-Stewart's story. Her seemingly complete home required demolition and rebuilding due to shoddy workmanship. The initial construction was a disaster, with no hope of repair. A new builder had to be hired, leaving Tamara financially crippled. She recalls signing the sale contract, believing she was achieving the Australian dream of homeownership. However, six weeks later, her dream turned into despair as her apartment flooded due to a missing drain pipe. This was just the beginning of numerous defects. The builder, Shangri-La Constructions, threatened Tamara when she confronted them about the issues. The worst defects were water damage, leading to toxic black mold, and flammable cladding, which made the building dangerous. Tamara had to pay for alternative accommodation while the building was demolished and rebuilt. She also had to take out a $2.1 million strata loan, costing her $200,000 a year in interest. Tamara, along with other owners in her block, refused to give up and paid for independent reports to prove the building's defects to the VBA. The VBA confirmed receiving these reports, which cost over $100,000. After Tamara repeatedly questioned why Shangri-La was still operating, the VBA admitted incompetence. They had lost all but one of the reports. Tamara expresses her devastation and the health problems her daughter experienced due to the mold, including an asthma diagnosis. She feels heartbroken and questions why no one is doing their job. The builder, Shangri-La, received a small fine and a three-month suspension, which was quashed on appeal. The company later went into liquidation, but some family members continued building under a different name, SLC Bayside. \\n\\nThe video shifts to the story of Rob Carcutt, a VBA inspector who took his own life 12 months prior. His widow, Andrea Holden, describes the stress he experienced due to his work. Rob loved his job and didn't want to be anything else. He was concerned about the unrealistic and unfair inspection targets set by the VBA. The inspectors were pressured to complete around 60 inspections a month, regardless of the defects found. This pressure led to Rob's stress and ultimately his suicide. Andrea feels that the situation is unforgivable and unfair. The video concludes with a discussion of the Victorian government ordering the VBA to increase inspections of new buildings in 2020. The Premier, Daniel Andrews, expresses confidence in the VBA's ability to do their job.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Construction site\",\n      \"Victorian Building Authority (VBA) office\",\n      \"Tamara Ralton-Stewart's home\",\n      \"Milla Apartments\",\n      \"Playground\",\n      \"Apartment with mold damage\",\n      \"Apartment under construction\",\n      \"Apartment building with scaffolding\",\n      \"Construction site with crane\",\n      \"Construction site with excavation\",\n      \"Another construction site\",\n      \"Tamara's home with reports on a bulletin board\",\n      \"Construction site with flammable cladding\",\n      \"Grocery store\",\n      \"Beach\",\n      \"Swimming pool\",\n      \"Construction site with wooden frame house\",\n      \"Construction site with excavator\",\n      \"Another construction site with workers\",\n      \"Press conference with Daniel Andrews\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"VBA inaction and incompetence\",\n      \"Shoddy workmanship in construction\",\n      \"Financial and emotional distress of homeowners\",\n      \"Pressure on VBA inspectors\",\n      \"Suicide of VBA inspector\",\n      \"Need for increased building inspections\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Ann\",\n      \"Tamara Ralton-Stewart\",\n      \"Rob Carcutt\",\n      \"Andrea Holden\",\n      \"Daniel Andrews\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.18713295,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16667561},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20055786,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.27591002},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.25982565,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16132025},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08509916,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1602664}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1099,"promptTokenCount":823028,"totalTokenCount":824127}}}

It shows Harris in his younger days, receiving accolades and honors, including an OBE, MBE, and Commander of the British Empire. He was a favorite of the Queen and painted her portrait. However, in 2014, his world collapsed when his victims came forward, and he was convicted of being a pedophile. He was stripped of his honors and reputation. The report shows footage of Harris being escorted by security and leaving court with his family. The segment concludes with a photo of Harris in his later years, bedridden with cancer, showing no remorse for his crimes.\\n\\nThe next news segment is about Rolf Harris's fortune. Nine News Europe Correspondent Carrie-Anne Greenbank reports live from outside Harris's home in Berkshire, UK. She mentions that Harris lived in a $9 million waterfront property and that his estate is estimated to be worth up to $28 million. His death may trigger an influx of civil cases against his estate. Harris's death was kept secret for almost two weeks, and the cause of death was neck cancer. He never apologized to his victims.\\n\\nThe following news segment reports on a house fire in Holsworthy, Australia. The fire started from an electric blanket and engulfed the family home of a recently retired couple. Their daughter and her partner were home at the time and escaped the flames. Neighbors tried to help extinguish the fire with garden hoses, but their attempts were futile. Firefighters arrived and used a ladder truck to put out the fire. The young couple said they had only had the electric blanket on for 20 minutes when it sparked. The fire spread rapidly through their bedroom.\\n\\nThe next news segment reports on four police officers injured in a crash while responding to a stolen truck incident in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane. One officer was airlifted to the hospital in serious condition after the truck rammed into his patrol car.

Garside's lawyers told a court that video footage shows his ex-partner, who accused him of assault, as the aggressor. The 25-year-old boxer was arrested upon arrival at Sydney Airport earlier this month and charged with an alleged physical altercation. He will appear in court next month. Garside was a representative for the state's diverse communities.\\n\\nThe next news segment reports on a racist comment made by former Multiculturalism Minister Mark Coure in state parliament. Coure allegedly said of new member for Cabramatta, Tri Vo, \\\"I thought he was from catering.\\\" Coure apologized to Vo, who is of Vietnamese descent. Many MPs say jokes are often used to belittle new faces in parliament, but Vo labeled the comment \\\"poor taste.\\\"\\n\\nThe final news segment is about rental reforms in New South Wales. The legislation would force real estate agents to tell other interested parties about a prospective tenant's bid if they offer more money to secure a lease, potentially creating \\\"rental auctions.\\\" Renters will have to wait longer for changes as an inquiry looks into how to implement the reforms.\\n\\nThe news segment concludes with a report on police collecting evidence from a dam in Portugal in the Madeleine McCann disappearance case. Nine's Europe Correspondent Edward Godfrey reports live from the Arade Dam, where police are conducting a search. They have collected several bags of evidence.

The narrator states that Ariarne Titmus moved to Queensland to chase her dream of becoming an Olympic swimmer. Her younger sister, Mia, who was 12 at the time, recalls telling her friends she was leaving in four weeks. She says it was hard to leave her friends. Ariarne is shown feeding horses. Her father, Steve, explains that the family had to make a quick decision to move to Queensland, the state that produces more Olympic swimmers than anywhere else in Australia, so Ariarne could pursue her dream. Ariarne and Mia are shown feeding horses again. The family moved to Queensland eight years ago. The mother says it was a chance they took, considering work opportunities. Ariarne is shown putting on her goggles at the edge of a pool. The narrator asks if the father had any idea that the 14-year-old he saw in 2015, training by herself in a public pool in Launceston, would become an Olympic champion. Dean Boxall, Ariarne's coach, says he didn't know at the time, but it became an urban legend. He says he heard stories about the Tasmanian girl because she beat one of his swimmers to make the junior team. He watched her closely and saw something in her, even though she wasn't the most talented and was behind in turns and dives. He says she was dogged and could take critique, which was coachable. Dean took her on, knowing there was a lot of work ahead. At 54 kilograms, Ariarne didn't look like a swimmer and had never been to the gym. Dean turned her into a warrior, building muscle and strength. Ariarne says Dean likes to describe every athlete as a door, and he has to find the key to the door. She says she's different in that she loves being told she can do better and being pushed to the edge. She thrives on being told she's not good enough and wanting to fight back and prove him wrong. She says she swims better when she's not getting compliments. Dean's style was considered unorthodox by many, but he decided it was the way to transform Ariarne into a champion. In the 400-meter freestyle, Ariarne was 16 seconds slower than Katie Ledecky, the greatest female swimmer of all time. But back then, it was an impossible dream because in the 400-meter freestyle, Ariarne was a massive 16 seconds slower. Seven years later, Dean's coaching was rewarded. Ariarne Titmus knocked Katie Ledecky from her perch, winning the 400-meter freestyle on the second night of the Tokyo Olympic Games. Ariarne is asked if she can still feel what it was like, even now. She says she got jets out of her backside and that her legs were cooked on the last lap, but she could feel them doing something. She got a boost and knew she was about to do it. She says it was the best feeling she's ever had in her life. Dean says he couldn't control his reaction, which went around the globe. He says it was everything they had done, the years of hard work, executing the race to the plan. He says he literally couldn't control it, it was a phenomenal feeling. Ariarne says that beyond swimming, Dean is more protective of her than her dad sometimes. She jokes about him giving speeches at her wedding and her kids going over to see Uncle Dean. Ariarne has opened up the safe to show her medals and other sporting mementos. Her father says there's no memorabilia or medals hanging up, it's all kept in a bank vault. Ariarne says her mom and dad nag her to have some stuff on display, but she spent so much time at the pool and thinking about swimming that she just wants to forget about it all. She thinks it's hard for them to understand that. Ariarne is deep in training for Paris 2024. Her world record has just been broken by a 16-year-old Canadian swimmer. She says when you get to this level, the tiniest thing can make the biggest difference. Ariarne and Dean now find themselves sought after as a public speaking duo, her as an Olympic champion, Dean for his Olympic reaction. Katie Page, CEO of Harvey Norman, took a punt on Ariarne three years ago, before she'd even won Olympic gold. She says Ariarne has a huge future in front of her, she's curious about the world, about business, and about other things, not just swimming. She guarantees Ariarne will be one of the leaders in the country. Ariarne and Dean are shown walking together. Ariarne says Dean is more protective of her than her dad sometimes. She jokes about him giving speeches at her wedding and her kids going over to see Uncle Dean. The narrator asks how to go faster. Ariarne says that when you get to this level, the tiniest thing can make the biggest difference.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2436427,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1302855},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.123365745,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.35667086},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.27591002,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14903527},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.29340422,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.34598845}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1172,"promptTokenCount":833647,"totalTokenCount":834819}}}

Then, the scene changes to a rocky cliff overlooking the ocean, with waves crashing against the rocks. A seagull is seen flying in the blue sky. The scene then shifts to a brick building with green leaves in the foreground. A gold sign on a wall reads \\\"ALYSSA & DUNCAN.\\\" Inside the room, Alyssa and Duncan are lying in bed, covered by a yellow blanket. They look at each other and smile. Alyssa says, \\\"It's got a bit of a glow to you.\\\" Duncan laughs and closes his eyes. Alyssa laughs and they snuggle under the blanket. Alyssa, 35, an executive assistant from New South Wales, says in an interview, \\\"Duncan and I have been intimate.\\\" Back in bed, Alyssa and Duncan continue to cuddle and laugh. Duncan says, \\\"It was very relaxing.\\\" Alyssa says, \\\"It was very relaxing, very intimate and romantic.\\\" Alyssa says in an interview, \\\"I can tell that he was definitely in his element.

The scene then shifts to a tall building with arched windows. Alessandra is taking a picture of Adam's backside with a Polaroid camera. Adam is wearing black underwear with the word \\\"Tradie\\\" written in neon green. The scene then changes to a kitchen, where a man with tattoos is wearing handcuffs and holding two red balls. He laughs and raises his arms in the air. A list of \\\"Something to try\\\" is shown, with options like \\\"Masturbation, solo\\\" and \\\"A penis ring.\\\" A couple, Harrison and Bronte, are sitting on a couch, discussing the list. Harrison says, \\\"Role playing. Yes.\\\" Bronte says, \\\"I'd do it.\\\" Harrison says, \\\"Yes. What type of costumes?\\\" Bronte says, \\\"That depends, doesn't it?\\\" They both laugh.

A sign on a wall reads \\\"CAITLIN & SHANNON.\\\" Shannon is walking into the room, reading a letter. He says, \\\"Often the most intimate experiences can come from the simplest acts like looking deep into someone's eyes.\\\" Caitlin is sitting on a couch, covered by a pink blanket. Shannon sits down next to her and they hold hands. Caitlin, 27, a makeup artist from Queensland, says in an interview, \\\"Shannon and I are in a good place after our cute little date the other night.

A couple is seen embracing in a doorway on the upper level. The camera then cuts to a woman, Claire, 31, a kindergarten assistant from Victoria, who is being interviewed. She wears clear glasses perched on her head, a black tank top, and has long brown hair. She talks about Jesse coming to her door to say goodnight, a gesture she found sweet. She expresses feeling positive about the day and their relationship, noting that Jesse seems to have taken advice from the previous day's session. She mentions feeling more connected to him and looks forward to sharing their space harmoniously. She plans to charge her crystals under the full moon and return with positive energy for the next day. The scene returns to the hallway, where Claire and Jesse are seen hugging goodnight at her door. The door has a sign that reads \\\"CLAIRE & JESSE\\\". The camera then pans up to show the exterior of the building at night, with the name \\\"SKYE\\\" illuminated on the top.\n\n\nThe scene transitions to a different apartment, where a sign on the door reads \\\"MELISSA & JOSH\\\". A framed wedding photo of Melissa and Josh is shown on a nightstand next to a bed with yellow sheets. The scene then cuts to Melissa and Josh sitting on a couch, having a serious conversation. Melissa, 41, a hairdresser from New South Wales, expresses concern about their lack of intimacy. She feels it's a crucial part of how she loves and is scared by its absence in their relationship. She questions Josh about how he can show intimacy without sex, emphasizing the importance of non-sexual intimacy. She points out his avoidance of physical touch like kissing and cuddling, expressing frustration and uncertainty about how to address the issue. Josh, 40, an advertising client director from New South Wales, listens with a concerned expression. He wears a purple v-neck t-shirt and black pants. Melissa becomes increasingly emotional, raising her voice and gesturing with her hands as she explains that she's uncomfortable with the lack of affection. She accuses Josh of having a problem with intimacy and of running away when things get tough. Josh puts his face in his hands, overwhelmed by the conversation. Melissa continues, saying she's speaking her truth for every woman and that Josh has a problem with getting close to someone. She accuses him of locking up or walking away when she tries to get close.\n\n\nJosh sits at a round table, looking distressed. He says he doesn't think he has a problem with intimacy and that the conversation is horrible. He feels that Melissa only sees their relationship as physical. He says all he's wanted is a deep conversation to get to know her better. He accuses Melissa of not having the depth to understand anything beyond sex. Melissa, sitting on the couch, retorts that he's wrong and that she does have depth. She accuses Josh of saying hurtful things and never apologizing. Josh leans back in his chair, looking defeated. He says he doesn't know what to do and questions why he's even participating in the experiment. Melissa says maybe her girlfriends were right and that perhaps Josh isn't enough for her. Josh says maybe they saw the writing on the wall. Melissa says she feels like Josh is intimidated by her desire for intimacy and that it bothers him because he can't keep up. She questions if it demasculinizes him and challenges his self-proclaimed \\\"big man\\\" persona. She points out that a wife likes intimacy with her husband. Josh looks away, covering his mouth with his hand. Melissa continues, saying she's giving so much to be there but doesn't know what she's doing it for.\n\n\nThe scene shifts to a montage of intimate moments between other couples. Harrison and Bronte are seen kissing in bed. Harrison is shirtless and wearing white Calvin Klein underwear. Bronte wears a white sweatshirt and black shorts. Alyssa and Duncan are seen drinking wine and kissing. Duncan is shirtless, and Alyssa wears a white robe. Duncan sets up a romantic candlelit dinner for Alyssa, arranging the candles in a heart shape with a note that reads \\\"CAILIN\\\" with a heart drawn next to it. Caitlin and Shannon are seen holding hands on a couch, then kissing on a bed with a yellow comforter. Melinda and Layton are seen holding hands and gazing at each other on a couch. The scene ends with Lyndall telling Cameron that when the relationship becomes a priority for him, he should let her know. Cameron covers his face with his hand, looking upset. Lyndall is seen lying on the couch, crying, while Cameron sits at the table. Lyndall says they're heading off the edge. The \\\"Married at First Sight\\\" logo appears, followed by the \\\"Endemol Shine Australia\\\" logo.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Hallway of a modern building\",\n        \"scene\": \"Claire and Jesse hug goodnight.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Claire's apartment\",\n        \"scene\": \"Claire talks about Jesse's sweet gesture.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Exterior of Skye building\",\n        \"scene\": \"Night view of the building.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Melissa and Josh's apartment\",\n        \"scene\": \"Melissa and Josh argue about intimacy.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Harrison and Bronte's bedroom\",\n        \"scene\": \"Intimate moments between Harrison and Bronte.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Alyssa and Duncan's apartment\",\n        \"scene\": \"Alyssa and Duncan share intimate moments, including a romantic dinner.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Caitlin and Shannon's apartment\",\n        \"scene\": \"Caitlin and Shannon hold hands and kiss.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Melinda and Layton's apartment\",\n        \"scene\": \"Melinda and Layton hold hands and gaze at each other.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Lyndall and Cameron's apartment\",\n        \"scene\": \"Lyndall expresses frustration with Cameron's lack of prioritization of their relationship.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Intimacy\",\n      \"Communication\",\n      \"Relationship challenges\",\n      \"Emotional connection\",\n      \"Physical affection\",\n      \"Vulnerability\",\n      \"Frustration\",\n      \"Commitment\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Claire\",\n        \"age\": 31,\n        \"occupation\": \"Kindergarten Assistant\",\n        \"location\": \"Victoria\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Jesse\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Melissa\",\n        \"age\": 41,\n        \"occupation\": \"Hairdresser\",\n        \"location\": \"New South Wales\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Josh\",\n        \"age\": 40,\n        \"occupation\": \"Advertising Client Director\",\n        \"location\": \"New South Wales\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Harrison\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Bronte\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Alyssa\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Duncan\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Caitlin\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Shannon\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Melinda\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Layton\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Lyndall\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Cameron\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08509916,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.09947014},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08632375,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16776322},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09534948,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1431879},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"LOW","probabilityScore":0.50683594,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.4600465}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1729,"promptTokenCount":1186763,"totalTokenCount":1188492}}}

\"FLIGHTS BOOST QANTAS ADDS MORE FLIGHTS ON INTERNATIONAL ROUTES\"\n    ],\n    \"Category\": \"News\",\n    \"DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations\": \"The video starts with a news segment about cheaper airfares. Then, the news anchors discuss the upcoming sports segment, which will feature the Rabbitohs chasing their seventh straight win. The next segment is about Brooks' future, followed by a segment on Rafael Nadal's retirement plans. The next segment is about a golfer getting dirty at the PGA Championship, and the final segment is about the Sydney weather forecast.\\n\\nThe sports segment begins with a live report from Allianz Stadium, where the Rabbitohs are playing the Eels. The reporter, Danika Mason, interviews commentator Brad Fittler about the game. Fittler says that the Eels are desperate for a win, as they are currently in fourteenth place on the ladder. He says that the return of Mitchell Moses will give them a chance to win, but they will need more than that to beat the Rabbitohs, who are in terrific form. The Rabbitohs have won this game five years in a row, and they are playing extremely well in Indigenous Round. Fittler says that the Eels started the season well, but they have had some bad injuries and have not really recovered. The reporter then thanks Fittler for his comments.\\n\\nThe next sports segment is about Jerome Luai, who is available for Origin selection after avoiding suspension for contrary conduct. Luai touched a match official after a try and has been fined $1800. The Panthers moved back to the top of the ladder after an 11-point win over the Broncos.\\n\\nThe next sports segment is about Tim Sheens, who has dropped a bombshell on the eve of Luke Brooks' 200th game. Sheens revealed that the West Tigers will table a multi-year deal to the off-contract halfback. Brooks will need to take a pay cut to remain a Tiger, as his current deal is worth around $1 million a season. Sheens, who signed Brooks as a teenager, is prepared for blowback, as the club puts its faith in one of the game's most scrutinized number sevens. Sheens said that he has always had his eye on keeping Brooks, and he does not care what external people say. He said that most people have no clue. Sheens will meet with Brooks' manager next week. At Tigers training today, despite undergoing a medical with Parramatta yesterday, Joe Ofahengaue's mid-season switch to the Eels is on hold for now. Sheens said that Ofahengaue is fine and will be starting tomorrow. He said that the club has not released him and that he is playing this weekend. Sheens said that he will decide on Ofahengaue's future next week and will let him know then. He said that he is not saying that Ofahengaue will be released next week, but he will decide then. Sheens said that he will let Ofahengaue know next week. The reporter said that the Rabbitohs have been the in-form side and that Indigenous Round is also important. She said that history shows that the Rabbitohs play extremely well in this round. Sheens said that the Rabbitohs have won this game five years in a row, and they are in terrific form. He said that they will be very hard to beat tonight. The reporter said that she is looking forward to all the action and that the game will be broadcast live on Nine from 7:30. Sheens thanked her for her comments.\\n\\nThe next sports segment is about an honest conversation with Wallabies coach Eddie Jones, which is the reason behind Jake Gordon's form reversal. The Waratahs skipper was overlooked by the new national coach for his first mid-season camp. Gordon said that he had a chat with Jones over the phone, and Jones gave him a few pointers. Gordon said that the main one was that he plays better when he is aggressive. The Waratahs are aiming to make it four wins in a row against the Fijian Drua tomorrow night.\\n\\nThe next sports segment is about Newcastle United securing a place in the Champions League for the first time in 20 years. The Magpies thrashed Brighton 4-1. There was still something for the Seagulls to cheer about, as 20-year-old Australian Cameron Peupion made his Premier League debut. His family on the Northern Beaches woke up early to watch the moment. Those celebrations had nothing on what happened at Hillsborough, where Sheffield Wednesday overturned a 4-0 first leg deficit before beating Peterborough in a penalty shootout to move into the League One playoff final. The win keeps their hopes of promotion to the Championship alive. Fans streamed onto the pitch to party with the players.\\n\\nThe next sports segment is about Rafael Nadal, who has ruled himself out of next week's tournament. The French Open is Nadal's second home, but we may have seen the last of the 14-time champion at Roland Garros. The 36-year-old is still struggling with a hip injury sustained at the Australian Open, admitting he is very close to retiring. He has competed in Paris every year since 2005, but at a press conference near his home in Mallorca, he confirmed he is pulling out of the French Open. Plagued by a hip injury he suffered during his Australian Open third round loss to Mackenzie McDonald in January, he initially believed he would be out for six to eight weeks. Fast forward four months, and the Spanish tennis star says he has still failed to regain full fitness. He is now taking a break for a number of months to prepare for what may well be the final year of his career. Todd Woodbridge said that without Nadal, we may not have had Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, and this era of incredible tennis that we have been able to witness.\\n\\nThe next segment is about Adam Scott, who is the best of the Australians after the opening day of the US PGA Championship in New York. He is two under par, three shots behind leader Eric Cole, but it could have been so much better if it wasn't for a double bogey at the last. If Scott was feeling dirty after his poor finish, spare a thought for Korea's Tom Kim, who took a mud bath while searching for his ball in a hazard. To clean himself off, he took a dunk in a freshwater creek running through the course. With the mud washed off, he played on like a true professional, with $15 million on the line.\\n\\nThe next segment is about a giant fine for AMP. As winter approaches and electricity prices soar, many of us are looking for ways to save without having to switch off the heater. One man says he has discovered the key to beat the chill and cut down on power bills. As a dedicated Salvation Army volunteer, David Slape spends his life helping others, but he also helps himself, slashing his energy bills by more than 30%. He rugs up, is vigilant about turning off everything not in use, and he also times his showers. He uses a cheap egg timer and puts it on for four minutes. He said that he doesn't even have to be home when it happens. He said that the target is not zero usage, but 10% less than your average. Canstar's research shows that Australians should brace for a big shock this winter, with average bills set to climb anywhere between $100 and $340. Customers are notified ahead of expected periods of high usage on the grid. They are then encouraged to switch off in return for bill credits. As a general rule, try not to set your heating on a split cycle too far above 20 degrees. Every degree above that mark can increase your energy usage by 10%. It also pays to be across available government rebates and assistance programs.\\n\\nThe next segment is about Qantas boosting its number of international flights. The carrier will add one million seats over the next 12 months on flights to Asia, the US, and the Pacific. Alan Joyce, Qantas CEO, said that the more supply you put in, the more capacity that is available to meet the demand, and the lower the airfares go.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.18952143,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17441037},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.111241356,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.24653345},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1623801,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.21601154},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08632375,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.21337745}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":4897,"promptTokenCount":799723,"totalTokenCount":804620}}}

A reporter asks her about playing for the royals. She describes King Charles as wonderful and mentions playing for him many times, including at dinner parties at St. James's Palace. The reporter jokingly remarks that King Charles can call her up for a performance instead of using a Spotify playlist. Madeleine reveals that King Charles is a huge classical music fan and relies on it to stay grounded. She recalls him saying that classical music keeps him sane, calms him, and grounds him. The reporter playfully suggests that Madeleine is the key to the King's sanity, to which she humorously agrees for a moment. The scene shifts to a choir and orchestra performing in a grand hall with red-shaded candles. The narrator describes the music as a beautiful soundtrack to a day the King will never forget. Madeleine expresses her joy at having one of the best days of her life, feeling like she was floating and not wanting the day to end. She mentions seeing various celebrities, including Joanna Lumley, Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry, and Boris Johnson. A procession of soldiers on horseback and a golden carriage carrying King Charles and Camilla follows. The narrator asks what can be expected from the new King and Queen. Charles Brandreth, a writer and broadcaster, comments that no one in the history of the British monarchy has come to the throne better prepared than Charles. The video then shows Scott Furssedonn-Wood getting ready in a hotel room, putting on a tie and jacket. He expresses the privilege of being part of history and describes receiving an invitation to the coronation. He shares the invitation with his father, who recalls watching Queen Elizabeth II's coronation on a rented television, the only one on their street. Scott's role is revealed as the King's High Commissioner designate to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. Prior to this, he served as Charles's deputy private secretary, accompanying him on royal tours from 2017 to 2021. The reporter asks Scott about his observations of Charles. He shares a story of Charles sending a long, handwritten letter and flowers to Scott's mother in the hospital when she was battling cancer, even though they had never met. The reporter notes that this reveals Charles's compassion, contrasting with the public's perception of him as stoic. Scott agrees, emphasizing that this is Charles's genuine nature. He adds that Charles believes in the importance of the monarchy's connection with people. The scene shifts to Charles interacting with schoolchildren and then with people at a train station. Charles Brandreth describes Charles as a workaholic, recalling an instance where the Queen showed him Charles's study piled high with paperwork. He mentions that Charles and Camilla are deeply in love and work well together as a team. Giles believes Charles aims to connect with everyday people, as evidenced by his choice of a relatively modest coronation. The narrator points out that this coronation was smaller in scale compared to previous ones, possibly due to the King's sensitivity to the cost-of-living crisis. Charles Brandreth agrees, noting the tension between the public's desire for spectacle and the King's frugality. The video shows scenes of crowds lining the streets of London, some celebrating and others protesting the new King. The narrator then introduces Craig Foster, co-chair of the Australian Republican Movement, who discusses the movement's long game and the changing attitudes towards the monarchy in Australia, especially since Queen Elizabeth II's reign. He expresses excitement about seeing Australia's response to the changing dynamics within the Commonwealth and the opportunity to question the Crown's role.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07055965,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.12085322},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06371513,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14903527},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1066907,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1530423},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.117572024,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16132025}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1012,"promptTokenCount":823027,"totalTokenCount":824039}}}

The camera then pans to a wider shot of the man walking away from the camera on a city street. The narrator states that the man, Chris Ridgeway, profited from a questionable global financial scheme to the tune of $1.6 million, while millions more invested by his clients are now missing. Ridgeway claims he doesn't know what happened to the money, although he says others likely do. The video then cuts to a shot of an older man in a parking garage, who is identified as David Sutton. Ridgeway claims that Sutton would know where the money went. The video then cuts to a shot of Ridgeway sitting in a chair, being interviewed. He says that he thinks it's a good question for the interviewer to ask Sutton if they ever get the opportunity.

Turner doesn't answer the door, but he later sends a statement denying any wrongdoing. The video then cuts back to Ridgeway, who is walking in a park. He says that he's been hung out to dry and that Sutton and Turner have done nothing to help him. The video then cuts to a group of people sitting around a table, being interviewed. They are the clients who lost their money in the scheme. They say that they have no sympathy for Ridgeway and that they want answers about how the scheme was allowed to happen and where the money went. The video then cuts back to Ridgeway, who is walking on a city street. He says that he may not be able to be a financial advisor again and that he may end up being charged with fraud and going to jail.

I avoid getting involved in drama and other people's situations.\\\" Lyndall is shown again, talking to Cam. She says, \\\"I need to die, but I saw it, Cam. That's not my fault.\\\" Cam says, \\\"Well, especially with us, like, the last commitment ceremony, Lyndall brought up something...\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"I may have missed her, and it might have been a joke, but I did hear...\\\" The scene briefly shows a group of people sitting on a couch, then returns to Lyndall and Cam. Lyndall says, \\\"When I picked up my things to go, Adam turned to me, he said, 'Don't go. You know that if you go, I'm going to go home with Claire.'\\\" The scene again shows the group of people, then returns to Lyndall and Cam. Cam says, \\\"What?\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"It's going to cause conflict, Lyndall.\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"Well, the only conflict I see right now is between you and me.\\\" Cam says, \\\"Exactly, and that's...\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"And I promise you tonight there will not be, and you will be feeling pretty silly for having this entire fight with me over pretty much nothing.\\\" Cam says, \\\"No, I don't feel silly at all. I'm not Dr. Phil. I just want to worry about us, you and me. I'm not here to impress anyone else but Lyndall. And I just feel like it's...\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"I came here for a relationship. I came here for a marriage, and I came here to get to know someone and build that relationship with somebody. But I did not come here to abandon parts of myself for peace and letting bad things happen to good people. I didn't get married to every man and his dog here.\\\" Cam says, \\\"Well, I got married to you.\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"No, but I'm friends with everyone here.\\\" Cam says, \\\"Yeah.\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"And I plan on being friends with everyone here for the whole experiment because I actually really like everybody here.\\\" Cam says, \\\"Well, that's good. So you're worried about...\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"And I also want to learn it.\\\" Cam says, \\\"What problem?\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"I should be silent and pretty and nice to everybody? That's not real. That's not honesty. That's not good friendship. That's not who I am.\\\" Cam says, \\\"No, you're not here for everyone else.

It's just I'm not here to play Dr. Phil for every man and his dog.\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"But you don't think I'm able to handle this?\\\" Cam says, \\\"It's not backing you. It's just I'm not here to play Dr. Phil for every man and his dog.\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"You can say what you want. I'm not saying you can and can't say anything. I just don't want it to bring conflict because now there's tension between us.\\\" Cam says, \\\"There is tension. You can't tell me there's not.\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"There's tension because you don't back me, Cam.\\\" Cam says, \\\"It's not backing you. It's just I'm not here to play Dr. Phil for every man and his dog.\\\" Lyndall says, \\\"You don't think I'm able to handle this?\\\" Cam says, \\\"I just don't really see...

He emphasizes the importance of taking necessary actions to achieve desired outcomes.\\n\\nThe scene shifts to a man in a suit standing in a park with a city skyline in the background. He talks about Australia's inflation rate, which ideally should be between 2% and 3%. However, the latest quarterly figures reveal a worrying 7% inflation rate. Although the rate is starting to decline, it took ten interest rate hikes to reach this point, indicating a persistent problem.\\n\\nThe video then shows a warehouse scene with workers handling produce. A forklift operator moves pallets of boxes labeled \\\"Gazzola Farms.\\\" The scene cuts to a person chopping carrots and placing them in a green container. The reporter mentions that the price of lettuce soared to over $10 last year. While salad is back on the menu, things are far from predictable in the fresh food market.\\n\\nThe reporter interviews Steven Biviano, a fresh food provider, in a warehouse. Biviano discusses the price of tomatoes, which has increased from $25-$30 a box to over $50. He highlights the devastating impact of inflation on businesses, mentioning that his nearest competitor recently went into administration. He emphasizes the challenging nature of running a business in the current economic climate, noting fluctuations in spending and a downturn across the board.\\n\\nThe video cuts back to a woman with long, curly brown hair, wearing a maroon shirt, speaking in a dimly lit room. She expresses her excitement about being an economist during these times, calling them the most interesting for her generation. The reporter points out that this is awful, unpredictable, and uncertain for the average consumer. The woman agrees, acknowledging the difficult situation.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to a woman working at a computer in an office at night. A sign on her desk reads, \\\"Heaven will protect the working girl.\\\" The narrator states that it's a good time to be an economist. The woman, identified as Gigi Foster from the University of New South Wales, believes that people need to prepare for a long road out of the current crisis. She warns of \\\"sticky inflation,\\\" meaning high prices will persist for years, not just months. She explains that \\\"sticky prices\\\" are resistant to change even when there are economic reasons for them to adjust. She predicts high prices and uncertainty will continue for at least a couple of years before returning to pre-COVID levels.\\n\\nThe video shows Foster walking through the university campus at night. She previously declared that lockdowns were doing more harm than good. She now claims that Australia's sluggish economy can be partly blamed on laziness and complacency among Australians, issuing an urgent call to action to avoid a recession.\\n\\nThe video cuts back to Foster in the interview room. She encourages Australians to take responsibility and work harder to improve the situation, even if the current economic problems aren't entirely their fault. She argues that the government can't solve the crisis alone and that individuals need to take initiative. \\n\\nA timelapse of a city street in Switzerland is shown, with people crossing the street and vehicles moving quickly. The narrator mentions Switzerland's low inflation rate, a stark contrast to Australia's. The video shows scenic views of the Swiss Alps, chocolate being stirred, and cheese wheels in a storage facility. The narrator highlights Switzerland's low inflation rate of 3%, which is the lowest in the Western world.\\n\\nThe video cuts to an interview with Professor George Sheldon from the University of Basel. He assesses the Swiss economy as being in very good shape, except for the 3% inflation rate, which is higher than their target of between 0% and 2%. He acknowledges that the cost of living in Switzerland is also high. The reporter points out that Switzerland's economy seems \\\"bomb-proof.\\\" Sheldon agrees, attributing it to their specialized, high-end industries, such as Swiss Army knives and watches, which other nations can't replicate. He also mentions Switzerland's low-cost electricity market as a contributing factor. He emphasizes that Switzerland, with its population of nine million, has a different business model compared to larger countries like the US and Australia, which focus on large-scale production.\\n\\nThe video returns to Australia, showing a Salvation Army store. A woman in a white shirt interviews a Salvation Army employee. The employee expresses concern about seeing working people, those with jobs, coming to the store due to the cost of living crisis. The scene shifts to a Senate committee meeting chaired by Senator Jane Hume, who is investigating the cost of living crisis. Hume emphasizes that Australians consider this the most important issue and expect the government to address it. She warns that if the government fails to tackle the crisis, it will be a grim winter for thousands of Australians. \\n\\nEconomist Steven Hamilton, sitting at his desk with two computer monitors, agrees that the time for avoiding the issue of inflation is over. He believes the Reserve Bank must raise interest rates and the treasurer needs to slash spending in the May budget. He argues that providing more government support would be counterproductive, as it would increase demand and worsen inflation. He concludes that lowering inflation takes time and requires difficult choices, such as potential job losses. \\n\\nThe video ends with the reporter summarizing the situation, highlighting the need for government action and the potential for a prolonged period of economic hardship.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09807943,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18832432},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.115960866,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.24798764},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19806427,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.21206883},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06097524,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.11920304599999999}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1396,"promptTokenCount":743673,"totalTokenCount":745069}}}

He reveals a past heartbreak but affirms his readiness to find love again. Rupert mentions his parents' disapproval of his participation in the show due to their religious beliefs.\\n\\nThe scene shifts to a discussion among three people about Evelyn and Rupert. The man in the center, wearing a black suit, talks about Evelyn's past heartbreak and suggests that Rupert, a reliable and dependable man, might be a suitable match for her. He believes Rupert can bring out different aspects of Evelyn's personality that she doesn't usually show with \\\"alpha\\\" guys. The woman in the pink dress adds that Rupert is an interesting choice, considering he's not Evelyn's typical type. The woman in the purple suit questions whether Evelyn has ever experienced a relationship with someone like Rupert. The man in the black suit emphasizes Rupert's openness and honesty as potential strengths in their relationship.\\n\\nThe video then transitions to the morning of two weddings. Taylor, a self-confessed control freak, is shown getting ready and expressing her anxieties about the unconventional nature of the marriage. She questions her decision to participate in the show and expresses a desire to have control over the situation. Taylor's bridesmaids attempt to calm her down, assuring her that everything will be okay and expressing excitement about meeting her groom. Taylor, however, continues to experience a meltdown, questioning her decision and feeling overwhelmed by the situation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Hugo, the groom, is shown getting ready and expressing his excitement about meeting Taylor. He acknowledges his nervousness but emphasizes his desire to get married and get to know Taylor. He expresses hope that she will be beautiful and shares his anticipation for their first meeting. Hugo's friends offer words of encouragement and express their excitement for him. He shares that he's a Capricorn, which is a goat, and jokes about the possibility of two \\\"goats\\\" named Hugo hanging out. Taylor's bridesmaids express concern about her potential reaction to Hugo, speculating that she might not be happy. Taylor, on the other hand, expresses her excitement and anticipation for meeting Hugo, hoping he's tall and good-looking. She acknowledges her nervousness and the daunting nature of the situation, but also her desire to give it her all. \\n\\nThe scene shifts to the wedding venue, where guests have arrived and are waiting for the ceremony to begin.

He suggests that the Reserve Bank must raise interest rates and the treasurer needs to slash spending in the May budget. He argues that providing financial support to people during inflationary periods can be counterproductive, as it increases demand and further fuels inflation.\\n\\nThe reporter then shifts the focus to the impact of inflation on consumers. He mentions that Australia's consumer price index is at a worrying 7%, despite ten interest rate hikes. He highlights the drastic increase in the price of lettuce last year, which soared to over $10 a head. While prices have come down somewhat, the situation remains unpredictable. A fresh food provider, Steven Biviano, shares his experience, stating that the price of tomatoes has risen from $25-$30 a box to over $50. He also notes a significant drop in spending across his client base, making it incredibly challenging to run a business.\\n\\nAn economist, Gigi Foster from the University of New South Wales, describes the current economic climate as the most interesting for her generation. She acknowledges the difficulties faced by consumers, describing the situation as awful, unpredictable, and uncertain. However, she also points out that it's a good time to be an economist. Foster believes Australians need to brace themselves for a long recovery from this crisis, as high prices and uncertainty are likely to persist for years. She attributes part of the economic sluggishness to what she perceives as laziness and complacency among Australians, urging them to work harder and take action to improve their situation.\\n\\nThe segment then explores how other countries have managed inflation. It highlights Switzerland, which has maintained a relatively low inflation rate of 3% despite global economic pressures. Professor George Sheldon from Switzerland's Basel University expresses disappointment with this figure, as the country aims for an inflation rate between 0% and 2%. The segment notes that Switzerland's success can be attributed to a low-cost electricity market and strong niche industries. However, it also acknowledges that Switzerland is a small, specialized country with a population of nine million, making its model difficult to replicate in larger, more diverse economies like Australia or the US.\\n\\nReturning to the Australian context, the segment features Liberal Senator Jane Hume, who is chairing a Senate committee investigating the cost of living crisis. She emphasizes the widespread concern among Australians about rising prices and their expectation for government action. Hume warns that the government needs to tighten its belt, as failing to address the cost of living crisis will have dire consequences for many Australians. She stresses the importance of government intervention, arguing that leaving people to their own devices will lead to a grim winter for thousands.\\n\\nThe segment concludes with Stephen Hamilton reiterating the need for the treasurer to slash spending in the May budget. He argues that providing more financial support to people will only exacerbate inflation, highlighting the need for fiscal responsibility and long-term solutions.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Indoor interview setting\",\n      \"Outdoor park with city skyline\",\n      \"Warehouse with produce and workers\",\n      \"Office setting\",\n      \"City street at night\",\n      \"City street during the day\",\n      \"Swiss Alps\",\n      \"Chocolate factory\",\n      \"Cheese cellar\",\n      \"Aerial view of Swiss city\",\n      \"Library or study\",\n      \"Salvation Army store\",\n      \"Senate committee hearing room\",\n      \"Black and white footage of post-World War II Australia\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Inflation\",\n      \"Economic crisis\",\n      \"Cost of living\",\n      \"Government policy\",\n      \"Business challenges\",\n      \"Consumer struggles\",\n      \"International comparisons\",\n      \"Potential solutions\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Stephen Hamilton (economist)\",\n      \"Steven Biviano (fresh food provider)\",\n      \"Gigi Foster (economist, University of New South Wales)\",\n      \"Jane Hume (Liberal Senator)\",\n      \"George Sheldon (Professor, Basel University)\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09947014,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19806427},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09268759,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.2553434},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19193311,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.21866964},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06465353,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.112795524}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1121,"promptTokenCount":743673,"totalTokenCount":744794}}}

But one of the things that particularly came out was that we heard that Harrison had gone out with some people within the group here, and Harrison got the number of a girl.\\\" The scene cuts back to the man and woman on the green couch. The man says, \\\"Harrison, as a married man, why did you take a girl's number in the first place?\\\" The man on the green couch says, \\\"I just wanted the conversation over and done with. I just wanted to navigate away from that without any conflict, and I felt like, in the moment, I felt like I was just being sympathetic to her feelings.\\\" A woman in a floral dress says, \\\"How lovely of you.\\\" The man in the black suit says, \\\"Was there any part of you that thought, 'I'm going to say no, I'm in a relationship. That would be inappropriate'?\\\" The man on the green couch says, \\\"Yes.\\\" The woman on the green couch says, \\\"Look, I'm a very secure woman. I know that women are going to hit on him. I get it. It's human nature. It happens. He's a good-looking guy.\\\" The woman in the floral dress says, \\\"I don't get it. I actually don't get it.\\\" The woman in the blue dress says, \\\"At the end of the day, I've got to build that trust, and that's why I'm here. And I'm choosing to trust him. I'm choosing to do that. And if I keep having doubts, there's no point me being here.\\\" The woman in the floral dress says, \\\"I don't like it one bit. I commend Bronte for being so secure in herself, but it just doesn't sit well with me at all. It actually makes me sick to my stomach.\\\" The man on the green couch says, \\\"I think it's a really simple thing to say, 'Sorry, I'm married.'\\\" The woman in the floral dress says, \\\"Thank you. No, thank you. There's intent behind taking someone's number, and that speaks louder than, yeah, it just doesn't sit well with me.\\\" The man in the black suit says, \\\"Do you think you would have told her if the group hadn't started talking about it?\\\" The man on the green couch says, \\\"At this stage, probably not.\\\" The woman in the blue dress says, \\\"I didn't think anything good would come from it. Under normal circumstances, I would have told her exactly what happened as soon as it happened. But we're not there yet.\\\" The man in the black suit says, \\\"Bronte, do you trust Harrison at this very moment?\\\" The woman in the blue dress says, \\\"Yeah, I do.\\\" The woman in the floral dress says, \\\"Harrison and I have been through a lot, and it's been a lot worse than a number. And I'm here to learn to trust, and yes, he's testing my limits 100%. But I want him to want to be better and to want to be able to communicate those sort of things with me.\\\" The man on the green couch says, \\\"Yeah, I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm taking every day as it comes because I feel like I'm seeing, now, for the first time in a long time, the girl that I met at the wedding. Now that girl came back this week, and I want more of that. And I'll do whatever it takes to earn your trust.\\\" The man in the black suit says, \\\"We're going to hold you to that. You have got to do better. There is a pattern there, and you can make a choice tonight to do it different, and that's what we want for you.\\\" The man on the green couch says, \\\"I'm not going out anymore. I'm just staying home from now on.\\\" The woman in the yellow dress says, \\\"That's not how you deal with it.\\\" The man in the black suit says, \\\"All right, decision time. You two, stay or leave. We'll go with you first, Bronte.\\\" The woman in the blue dress says, \\\"Well, obviously, I feel like Harrison and I have a long way to go, and we've made some really good progress. So, I write 'stay'.\\\" The man in the black suit says, \\\"Now, Harrison, over to you.\\\" The man on the green couch says, \\\"Um, yeah, I feel like I got Bronte back this week, and I like that. So, I'm going to stay.\\\" The woman in the blue dress says, \\\"You can go back to your seats.\\\" The woman in the purple dress says, \\\"Up next, we'd like to invite Sandy and Dan to come up to the couch.\\\" The woman in the purple dress says, \\\"When we saw you last night, there was so much going on. And the last that we saw of you last night, the vibes were very different from when I last saw you a few days ago. So, Daniel, I wonder if you can tell me what it was like for you.\\\" The man in the gray shirt says, \\\"Uh, so, dinner party was going great last night, and Harrison grabbed me and called me aside and said, 'Hey, can we have a chat?' And he said, 'I just had a conversation with Janelle and Adam about the night that we were out.' And part of that conversation was that I would got a number as well and did the same thing. And I said straight up, like, I didn't get a number, anything like that. I felt, at that point in time, my integrity was under question. And I wanted to make it very, very clear that the accusations that were thrown around weren't accurate at all whatsoever.\\\" The woman in the purple dress says, \\\"Tell me, Sandy, this is your first relationship, and the trusting and the feeling that you can really trust somebody has been a huge issue for you entering this relationship. I'd like for you to explain to me what was going through your mind.\\\" The woman in the yellow dress says, \\\"Well, because, obviously, I'm opening up more to Dan and being more vulnerable, so with that comes, obviously, my trust as well. So, I was upset because, yeah, if he has taken a number, that doesn't sit well with me.\\\" The woman in the blue dress says, \\\"You know, Harrison and I have been through a lot, and it's been a lot worse than a number. And I'm here to learn to trust, and yes, he's testing my limits 100%. But I want him to want to be better and to want to be able to communicate those sort of things with me. Hopefully, the positives just start to outweigh the negatives.\\\" The man on the green couch says, \\\"Yeah, I'm trying. I'm trying.

A white motorboat is seen moving on the water. The sun is shining brightly in the sky. The scene then shifts to a boat with a person steering it. The Sydney skyline, including the Opera House, is visible through the boat's window. A man in a dark uniform with yellow stripes on the shoulders is seen standing on the boat. The words \\\"Australian Border Force\\\" are written on the uniform. The boat has a sticker that reads \\\"Australian Border Force.\\\" An Australian flag with the words \\\"Australian Border Force\\\" written on it is shown waving in the wind. \\n\\nTwo men are sitting on the boat, having a conversation. The man in uniform is identified as Superintendent Graeme Campbell of the Australian Border Force. The other man asks him about the threat posed by the cruise ship industry in Australia. Campbell replies that it's a real threat for the importation of narcotics. He clarifies that most passengers and crew are legitimate travelers, but a small element tries to use the industry to import narcotics. The other man points out that Australia is a big island and a big target. Campbell agrees, adding that it's a big coastline and an attractive target for organized crime. He admits that policing it is very hard, but they are good at it. \\n\\nThe scene shifts to a cruise ship sailing on the sea. A collage of photos of two women is shown. The women are identified as Isabelle Lagace and Melina Roberge. They were identified as passengers of interest, and one of the destinations on their itinerary was a major concern. Campbell explains that certain ports in South America are associated with cocaine production and distribution, and the ship visited some of those ports. This escalated the risk, as it gave the passengers access to organized crime entities in high-risk countries. The other man asks at what point they had eyes on the passengers. Campbell says they were monitoring their movements. \\n\\nA close-up shot of the cruise ship is shown, followed by a shot of a lush green forest. A woman with long blonde hair is sitting in a chair in a room. She says the plan was to bring cocaine from Peru to Sydney on the cruise ship. She thought it might or might not work, and she wasn't thinking about the consequences. \\n\\nIsabelle and Melina were two of nearly 2,000 passengers on board the Sea Princess as it approached Peru. A couple, Barry and Nerida Rowe, are shown in photos taken during their cruise. They were making the most of their port days, taking in the sights. They didn't see much of Isabelle or Melina in Peru. On their day trips, Isabelle and Melina were never on the bus with Barry and Nerida. There was nothing to indicate that they were up to mischief. However, they were certainly up to something. \\n\\nSomeone is shown unpacking a suitcase, revealing packages wrapped in plastic and tape. The narrator says this was the most crucial part of their mission: the cocaine pickup. A mountainous landscape is shown. The woman with long blonde hair says they were aware that Peru was the destination for the drugs, but they weren't going to be in their cabin yet. So, they continued the trip, enjoying the streets of Peru. She had way too much to drink and remembers doing a lot of Snapchat stories, laughing, and living her best life. \\n\\nScenes of people partying on the cruise ship are shown. The plan couldn't have been more straightforward. While the party girls partied, a mystery man collected the drugs. He loaded them into a suitcase, smuggled it on board the Sea Princess, and later, after getting the key from Isabelle, placed it under the bed in their cabin. A diagram of the cruise ship is shown, with a suitcase icon moving to a specific cabin. The narrator says it seems like an extraordinary lapse of security. Barry and Nerida are seen walking on a dock. They weren't exactly surprised. Barry says he can't fathom how anyone could think they could smuggle something on board a vessel. Nerida says they would never smuggle anything. Barry jokes about smuggling a bottle of wine. They had no idea that other stuff was being loaded on. \\n\\nThe Sea Princess now had new cargo: more than $20 million worth of cocaine. The party girls are shown in various locations, enjoying their free holiday. The woman with long blonde hair says it was beginning to be stressful after Peru, but she tried to enjoy the cruise as much as she could. She got a hand tattoo in Tahiti, which was the most beautiful destination. She says that's the only thing she doesn't regret about the trip. \\n\\nThe Sea Princess is shown arriving in Sydney. No one on board could have imagined what was about to unfold. Passengers are seen disembarking the ship. For Isabelle and Melina, it was the final stop on a mission to import cocaine into Australia. Police cars are shown driving on a dock. The Australian Border Force logo is shown. Campbell is seen on a boat. The narrator says that as the Sea Princess sailed closer to Australia, the operation to close in intensified, and the Australian Border Force was ready and waiting. \\n\\nCollages of photos of Isabelle and Melina are shown. Campbell says they were looking to break laws and do bad things. He and his officers were tasked with finding the two women on board. Most passengers were in observation areas or on the open deck when they entered Sydney Harbour. It was highly likely that Isabelle and Melina would be in those areas, but there was no guarantee. The boarding team engaged with the security team on board, identified where the women were, and radioed that information. The boarding teams entered and spoke to the individuals, saying they wanted to conduct an examination of their cabin and asked them to accompany them. \\n\\nThe woman with long blonde hair says that in the morning, people were starting to disembark the ship. She went upstairs to the buffet to eat breakfast, and that's when the Border Force entered the restaurant. She knew it was over. They were almost the only ones in the restaurant. The Border Force asked if it was her bed and luggage, and she said yes. She didn't know the combination. They cut it open to find about 30 kilograms of cocaine. Campbell says the drugs weren't hidden. \\n\\nBarry and Nerida were sitting in the cafe when they saw a dog and a uniformed man. There were a few of them. Barry's friend told him the police and dogs had the girls on the floor. Nerida thought it was normal at the end of a cruise, but then she saw them walk past and go down the corridor. Her friend told her they had the girls, police, and dogs. Barry says that answered a lot of questions. \\n\\nThe woman with long blonde hair says the Border Force asked if it was her bed and luggage, and she said yes. She didn't know the combination. They cut it open. Campbell says it was obvious the drugs weren't hidden. He says they were just under a blanket. He says the girls' reaction was that they were very nervous and quiet. \\n\\nThe video ends with a shot of the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Sydney Opera House\",\n      \"Sydney Harbour Bridge\",\n      \"Sydney Harbour\",\n      \"South America\",\n      \"Peru\",\n      \"Sydney\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Drug smuggling\",\n      \"Cruise ship security\",\n      \"Organized crime\",\n      \"Australian Border Force\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Graeme Campbell\",\n      \"Isabelle Lagace\",\n      \"Melina Roberge\",\n      \"Barry Rowe\",\n      \"Nerida Rowe\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21866964,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13477601},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"LOW","probabilityScore":0.57081026,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.4455295},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19314747,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1835935},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20946948,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3424617}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1724,"promptTokenCount":743672,"totalTokenCount":745396}}}

The words \\\"As Queen of Australia, I have always felt a\\\" are displayed above the images.\\n\\nThe scene changes to the same building from a wider angle. The entire building is now covered in images of the Queen. The Australian flag is flying from a flagpole on top of the building.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a man with gray hair wearing the same black t-shirt as before. He is sitting in a chair and talking to someone off-screen.\\n\\nA man in a blue suit appears on screen. He is talking to the man in the black t-shirt.\\n\\nThe man in the black t-shirt says, \\\"You've got a lot of passion for our country. Could you be our head of state?\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the blue suit laughs and says, \\\"No, no, listen, this is enough, this is enough for me.\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the black t-shirt says, \\\"Because I was thinking, you know, it's quite a step from King Charles to President Craig.\\\"\\n\\nBoth men laugh.\\n\\nThe man in the black t-shirt says, \\\"Craig's a good Australian name.\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the black t-shirt says, \\\"Well, you know what, so is Ashrif, you know, and Hakeem, you know, and Mostafa.\\\"\\n\\nThe man in the blue suit says, \\\"Yeah, this is the nuts and bolts of it.

So, perhaps you should ask that to all the First Nations leaders who are talking about what colonization means to them, you know. Perhaps we should talk to the multicultural communities who might say that, well, we've been here for decades and decades and decades, but we're still not represented in all the institutions across the country. And so it is important to big sections of Australia. It's incredibly important.

The industry regulator, a vital arm of the state government, seems to have given up doing its job. It's called the Victorian Building Authority, or VBA, and it's supposed to protect consumers from dodgy construction companies and tradespeople. On assignment for 60 Minutes, The Today Show's Kristina Hurn reports. The VBA's inaction is a crushing hammer blow for people trying to build a roof over their heads.\\\"\\n\\nThe scene changes to a woman in a hard hat and safety vest walking through a construction site with a man in a hard hat and safety vest.

Seven and a half years later, and millions and millions of dollars spent fighting.\\\"\\n\\nThe scene changes to a woman in a blue suit standing in front of a building with a sign that says \\\"VBA.\\\"\\n\\nThe woman says, \\\"Anger is growing over the collapse of residential construction giant Porter Davis. But especially in Victoria, because the construction industry is in crisis. By a half-million-dollar apartment, but you get nothing. By reputation, he's a super bloke, but he's not superhuman. Today, though, using only his bare hands, Phil wants to show how easy it is to demolish a modern residential apartment block in Melbourne southeast. Look at that. It just came off. With his bare hands. I find that staggering. By reputation, he's a super bloke, but he's not superhuman. Today, though, using only his bare hands, Phil wants to show how easy it is to demolish a modern residential apartment block in Melbourne southeast. Look at that. It just came off. With his bare hands. I find that staggering. This shoddy building by Shangri-La Constructions went up only a decade ago, but is now crumbling before our very eyes. I just think it's so embarrassing for our industry. Clearly, we've got an issue. Phil says there are buildings like this all over the country. If anyone understands that devastation, it's Anne. She'd hoped these townhouses would one day be home for her entire family. But 15 months after construction, what she uncovered crushed that dream. 50 defects, a direct result of shoddy workmanship, including significant water damage, dangerous cladding, and walls that weren't fireproofed, which could have been catastrophic. How much has it impacted your? Um, it's impacted our health. It's um taken away from time that I should be spending with my children. So it has devastated us. What about the builder? He's continuing to build. He's still out there. How did you go about choosing the builder? We checked the VBA website uh to make sure that um he didn't have any disciplinary action against him, and that's how we ended up going with him. At what stage did it reach a head with the builder? Well, it reached a head when we wanted a waterproofing specialist to go on site, because we were very concerned about those walls, and he refused us access. The builder went even further, locking Anne out. Her only option, terminate the contract to regain access, which back in 2018, Anne wholeheartedly believed the watchdog had her back and was confident she was doing the right thing with her home builder. The one place Anne should have been able to turn to is a bigger mess than our worst construction sites. In Victoria, the buck should stop here. It's called the Victorian Building Authority, or the VBA. It's the government watchdog set up to rid the industry of dodgy builders and plumbers. But it's simply not doing its job, and their own employees say the culture within is dangerously toxic. They are our regulator. They're supposed to look after compliance, and unfortunately, they fail that test completely. In what way are they not doing their job? Why we've got more than 20,000 builders in Victoria. Most of them do the right thing, but there's a huge element that are doing the wrong thing because they can get away with it. And tragically, they are.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.117572024,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18126312},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.122523345,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.22000723},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21337745,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17667185},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07807837,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13117331}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":2535,"promptTokenCount":823028,"totalTokenCount":825563}}}

She expresses her distress over Harrison's actions, claiming she has supported him through everything and hasn't said a bad word to him, yet she feels like he is walking all over her and treating her poorly. She says she came on the show to find love and be loved, and apologizes for the situation. The scene transitions to the show's logo, \\\"Married at First Sight,\\\" followed by a panoramic view of the Sydney skyline at dusk, and then a close-up of the \\\"SKYE\\\" sign on a building. The narrator states that Caitlin has separated herself to regroup after Shannon's devastating blows.\n\n\nCaitlin is then shown wiping her face in a room with wooden doors and wall-mounted lights. She is wearing a tan, ribbed cardigan over a black shirt and has black sunglasses perched on her head. She then washes her face in a bathroom sink, with various beauty products visible on the counter. She expresses her belief that Harrison must think she's an idiot, especially after everything that has happened in the past few weeks.\n\n\nA flashback shows Caitlin and Harrison sitting on a brown leather couch, having a serious conversation. Caitlin, wearing a tank top with celestial patterns, expresses her ongoing feelings for her ex. Harrison, in a green long-sleeved shirt and ripped jeans, admits that he still loves his ex, which visibly upsets Caitlin. In another flashback, Caitlin, wrapped in a pink blanket, confronts Harrison about talking to his ex about her. Harrison, sitting on the couch in a gray tank top and jeans, confirms that he did keep his ex on the fence in case things didn't work out with Caitlin. Caitlin expresses her desire to run away but chooses to stay.\n\n\nBack in the present, Caitlin is applying makeup in the bathroom mirror. She reiterates her support for Harrison and her confusion about his treatment of her. She mentions her vows about being taken for a ride too many times and feels like Harrison is doing the same to her. She then walks through their apartment, expressing her anger at Harrison and herself for letting him treat her this way.\n\n\nCaitlin confronts Harrison on the couch, expressing her need to gather her thoughts and accusing him of talking to his ex about her. Harrison denies it, but Caitlin says she feels like she has the right to be upset. She accuses him of saying degrading things to her, like calling her a good-looking girl but not for him. She criticizes him for saying he wanted to be blown away when she walked down the aisle, implying that if he had been, things with her ex wouldn't have happened. Caitlin expresses her frustration at being treated poorly despite being kind and strong. She asserts that she deserves better and that while Harrison doesn't need to love or even like her, he does need to respect her. She declares that she is a brilliant and amazing person and won't tolerate being treated this way anymore. Harrison listens, looking downcast and putting his hand to his face. Caitlin gathers her belongings, a leopard-print duffel bag and a smaller black bag, and leaves the apartment. Harrison sits on the couch, looking distraught.\n\n\nThe scene shifts to a preview for the next episode, showing a brick building during the day and then at night. The narrator announces the experiment's second dinner party. Lyndall, in a green one-shoulder dress, says she has some things to say. Harrison is shown in a car, looking thoughtful. Lyndall reveals that she saw Shannon with his daughter and another woman. Claire, sitting on a brown leather couch in a white halter top and skirt, expresses her concerns. The narrator mentions that both Claire and Lyndall are key witnesses. The scene cuts to a group of women sitting on a couch, including Caitlin, Lyndall, and Claire, discussing the situation. Caitlin says she will always do the right thing to stop people from getting hurt, even if it means hurting herself. Lyndall whispers something to Claire, who reacts with shock. The narrator reveals a brand new accusation, involving a most unlikely group. Selina asks, \\\"Dan, as in Sandy's Dan?\\\" The scene cuts to the experts, looking surprised. Dan, in a white blazer and purple shirt, asks what he's supposed to do. The scene ends with Lyndall walking away from the dinner table in a blue sequined dress. The \\\"Married at First Sight\\\" logo appears again, followed by the EndemolShine Australia logo.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Hallway with glass walls and metal frames\",\n      \"Room with wooden doors and wall-mounted lights\",\n      \"Bathroom\",\n      \"Apartment living room with brown leather couch\",\n      \"Apartment bedroom\",\n      \"Sydney skyline\",\n      \"SKYE building\",\n      \"Car\",\n      \"Dinner party venue\",\n      \"Apartment dining area\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Relationship issues\",\n      \"Infidelity\",\n      \"Emotional distress\",\n      \"Self-respect\",\n      \"Communication breakdown\",\n      \"Betrayal\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Caitlin\",\n      \"Harrison\",\n      \"Shannon\",\n      \"Lyndall\",\n      \"Claire\",\n      \"Selina\",\n      \"Dan\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14706427,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18832432},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1623801,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.24220619},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.3946677,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.35488012},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.271252,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.36026415}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1214,"promptTokenCount":1174078,"totalTokenCount":1175292}}}

She emphasizes the need for better treatment of each other. The man listens attentively, nodding occasionally.\\n\\nThe scene then cuts to the 60 Minutes program's closing segment.

The scene transitions to a stage with red lighting and a large cross. People on stage are acting out a scene, with one person lying on the floor. The narrator states that demons and Satan are used by the Potter's House Church to instill fear and control. The scene changes to a different stage with purple lighting. A man is being dragged away by two figures in dark cloaks and masks, while another figure in a dark cloak and mask stands nearby. The narrator explains that this is a stage show put on by the church, attended by young children. A demon drags a man away, complete with mock blood and terrifying costumes. The scene transitions to a dark room where a man is being dragged through the audience. The scene changes to a close-up of a face with wide eyes, the mouth covered by something dark. The scene transitions to a volcano erupting, with a face superimposed on the lava. The narrator mentions the ever-present fear of hell. The scene transitions to two women sitting on a couch, one with long dark hair and a pink sweater, the other with blonde hair and a white blouse. They are looking at a laptop. The blonde woman asks why they were shown these movies. The dark-haired woman, Amy Higginson, replies that it was to scare them and to make them follow what they were being taught. She says that if they weren't living the lifestyle the church wanted, they would be stuck in hell on earth. The scene transitions to a sunset over the ocean. Amy Higginson is shown on the beach, looking out at the water. The narrator explains that Amy was born into the Potter's House and grew up knowing nothing else. A clip from an old movie is shown, where a man in a helmet asks another man if he wishes to renounce his faith in his god. Then, two soldiers drag a woman to a guillotine. The scene transitions back to the two women on the couch. Amy says that the movies still terrify her. Another clip from the old movie is shown, where the woman is beheaded. The scene transitions back to the two women on the couch. Amy starts crying and says it's hard to watch. The blonde woman asks what it's bringing up for her. Amy says she lived in fear of what her future would look like if she wasn't doing exactly what she was told, to be a good Christian and to follow an extensive set of rules and expectations of life. She says the fear was prominent there all the time. The scene transitions to Amy walking on the beach. The narrator explains that Amy lived her young life constantly nervous that if she did something wrong, demons would grow inside her. Amy says that her dad used the word \\\"manifesting\\\" to describe the demons inside her, and that number would multiply until she had potentially thousands of demons inside her, which would be harder and harder to remove and get rid of. The blonde woman asks what Amy was doing that was wrong, what was considered bad behavior. Amy says that even something as simple as listening to non-Christian music or reading a non-Christian book would be considered bad behavior. The scene transitions to Amy sitting on the beach, looking out at the water. The narrator explains that both Amy and Katrina left the church as young adults. The scene transitions to Katrina standing on a grassy area by the water, looking out at the city skyline. The narrator continues, saying that neither were shocked to hear of the link between the extreme sect and the tragedy on the Melbourne Freeway in 2020. The scene transitions to a night scene of a car accident on a freeway, with police cars and a truck. The scene then changes to a group of people in suits walking down a city street. The narrator explains that they can understand why the trucking boss, Simon Teterru, thought prayer would fix the drug-addicted truck driver's problems. The scene transitions to a close-up of a man's hand holding a white mask. The man is praying. The scene transitions back to the woman with long brown hair, who says that when she heard about the news, she knew it was based on what they do. Amy says that the fact that he believed in voodoo and didn't see it as someone who needed serious help doesn't surprise her at all. She says he believed that what he was doing was the right thing. The blonde woman says that instead of telling him to get help, he prayed with him and cast a spell out of him. Amy says that for the Potter's House, that's just normal and something that they genuinely believe. She says that in reality, she feels like anyone else would have known how to respond in that situation. The scene transitions to a bald man looking out a window with orange glass. The blonde woman asks if he feels some remorse or even guilt when he hears these stories that occurred when he was the leader of the church. The bald man, David Vickery, says absolutely. He says that the first couple of years that he came out of the Potter's House, every time he saw an ex-member, he began the conversation with an apology. He says he was certainly never apologizing for any of the extreme acts mentioned, but he recognized he was a part of it, having been there since he was 19 years old, grew up in it, got very used to it and just didn't see the errors and the extreme that were there. The blonde woman asks what his message is for pastors in the Potter's House now. David says his word to the Potter's House leaders would be to rejoin the mainstream Christian church and allow them to bring that community correction in areas where they've overbalanced or gone into extreme. The scene transitions to a man in a blue suit on a stage, throwing money into the air. A group of people behind him are also throwing money into the air. The narrator explains that when Potter's House senior member Simon Teterru chose to pray for his exhausted truck driver and advised him to get back behind the wheel, four police officers lost their lives. The scene transitions to four photographs of police officers. The scene then changes to a group of people walking down a city street. The narrator explains that three months after the tragedy, Victoria police charged Teterru with four counts of manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty and a trial date was set. The scene transitions to a man in a blue suit walking through a parking lot. The narrator explains that in October last year, inexplicably, the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions dropped all the charges. The scene transitions to the inside of a church, where a man in a white shirt is walking down the aisle, collecting money in a bucket. The narrator explains that these days, Simon Teterru is no longer a pastor, but is still a senior member of the church. The scene transitions to a close-up of a chain-link fence, with a building in the background. The scene then changes to a close-up of a sign that says \\\"Welcome to the Potter's House Church\\\". The scene then changes to a night scene of a car accident on a freeway, with police cars and a truck. The narrator explains that when they contacted him, he refused to tell them anything about what happened on that terrible afternoon three years ago. The scene transitions to an aerial view of a building with a sign that says \\\"The Potter's House Christian Fellowship Church\\\". The scene then changes to a man with a long white beard sitting on a couch with the blonde woman. They are looking at a photo album. The man says that's the sunset where their house is, and there she is sitting on the deck with that sunset. He then points to a photo of a woman in a car, saying that's Stuart Schultz. He says he's even more angry about the continued existence of the Potter's House Church. The blonde woman asks how it feels knowing that Simon Teterru is a free man and is still attending church, getting on with his life. The man says it's frustrating that he is, frustrated he's not faced court for anything. He says it riles him to anger almost. He says that's how it feels, shouldn't have happened. He says Kevin, Josh, Glenn, Lynette and their families all need to have closure. He says they all need to have justice. The blonde woman asks what justice means for him now. The man says everyone who had a role in the deaths needs to be held to account. He says Kevin, Josh, Glenn, Lynette and their families all need to have closure. The scene transitions to a clock face with the words \\\"60 MINUTES\\\" in red. The clock hand is pointing to the 30. The words \\\"COMING UP\\\" appear on the screen. The scene transitions to a woman in a silver dress handing an award to a man in a tuxedo. The scene then changes to a shirtless man sitting in bed. The scene then changes to a group of people standing in front of a building. The scene then changes to two men dancing. The scene then changes to a man singing on a stage. The scene then changes to a man in a gold sequined jacket and a blonde wig, holding a microphone. The scene then changes to a man in a leopard print robe holding a picture frame. The scene then changes to the man singing on a stage again. The scene then changes to the words \\\"CANCELLED\\\" superimposed over the shirtless man. The scene then changes to the man singing on a stage again. The scene then changes to a woman in a red suit sitting on a stool in front of a red curtain. She says there's no dispute, Hugh Sheridan is one of the nicest people you could ever meet, on screen and in the theater. She says he's also one of Australia's finest and most loved actors. She asks how anyone can make sense of this. She says in 2020, he became the target of a vile hate campaign that almost broke him. The scene transitions to a clock face with the words \\\"60 MINUTES\\\" in red. The clock hand is pointing to the 60. The scene transitions to the woman in the red suit again. She says the reason he was attacked so viciously.\n\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.25386122,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.23934989},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.28298867,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.2743521},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.38722748,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3040417},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19072437,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.30486867}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":2201,"promptTokenCount":843088,"totalTokenCount":845289}}}

It then transitions to a series of news headlines. The first headline, \\\"FIRE EMERGENCY,\\\" shows a seven-story building engulfed in flames in the heart of Sydney. The walls of the building come crashing down, and the fire is visible from Central Station. The second headline, \\\"POLICE SHOOTING,\\\" shows a man who was shot dead in his driveway at North Willoughby. Police officers are seen at the scene, which is cordoned off with police tape. The third headline, \\\"REMEMBERING TINA,\\\" features images of Tina Turner, the rock legend who recently passed away at the age of 83. The video shows clips of her performing, including her involvement in rugby league. The fourth headline, \\\"FRESH DETAILS,\\\" shows a police officer saluting and a brick wall with the words \\\"YALLAMBEE LODGE\\\" written on it. It also shows a picture of an elderly woman named Clare Nowland, who was allegedly tasered. The fifth headline, \\\"ELECTRIC SHOCK,\\\" shows household appliances such as a microwave, toaster, kettle, and vacuum cleaner. The video then transitions to a story about a rugby league \\\"bad boy\\\" who has transformed himself and will make his debut for the Blues. \\n\\nAfter the headlines, the news program begins with Peter Overton, the news anchor, reporting on the fire emergency in Surrey Hills. He describes the fire as having \\\"staggering speed\\\" and destroying a seven-story building. He mentions that 20 fire trucks and over 100 firefighters are on the scene. The video shows footage of the fire, with flames engulfing the entire building and walls collapsing onto the street. The fire is visible across the CBD, and flames are seen lapping at surrounding buildings and destroying cars on the street. Thousands of people watched as trains continued to pass by at nearby Central Station. The fire started at 4 o'clock, and smoke poured out of the second floor. The roof was the first to disappear into the flames, and the structure weakened, causing the walls to come tumbling down onto the building next door and into the alleyway. Thankfully, no one was around. Reporter James Wilson witnessed the event and describes hearing a \\\"massive bang\\\" followed by a burst of flames, sparks, and embers. He saw a big chunk of the building collapsing. Within minutes, there was a domino effect, and two other walls came down. The mission for the 100 firefighters and 20 trucks was to protect the surrounding buildings. At one point, the flames jumped across the road to nearby rooftop gardens, but crews were quick to react, saving the apartment block. A man interviewed on the street mentions that some of the surrounding buildings had gas bottles on the roof, and there was worry about explosions. His friend was at home and smelled the smoke, coming outside to see what was happening. A woman interviewed on the street says that even standing in the doorway of a neighboring business, it felt like they were cooking, roasting. A man interviewed on the street says it was like a war zone. As the sun faded, the sky was filled with smoke and an eerie orange glow. The cause of the fire will be the center of the investigation. \\n\\nBack in the studio, Peter Overton reports on the police shooting in Willoughby. He mentions that senior police are backing the actions of two colleagues involved in the fatal shooting of a man who lunged at officers with knives. The suspect had earlier threatened residents in the street. The confrontation is now the subject of a critical incident investigation. A man lies dead in the driveway of a house on Alexander Street, North Willoughby. Two carving knives are close by. Two local schools were sent into lockdown. A witness, Paul Mench, says that one of the sons who lives there, potentially with mental health, was yelling and screaming. Police arrived at the house around 11:30 this morning after reports that the man was threatening residents. He also, according to officers, confronted them, and that's when they opened fire with four shots to the body. Neighbor Mujahid Dorwali heard the lead-up to the shooting. He says one guy was crying and shouting, “I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you!” Residents say that after they heard the man shouting, about eight minutes elapsed before they heard the four gunshots. Another critical incident involving police. This time, headed by Assistant Commissioner Leanne McCusker. She says a male was behaving erratically, behaving aggressively, chasing people down the street, approaching neighbors. He ran at police, and one of the police officers then discharged their firearm. When asked if she was satisfied with the officers’ actions, she replied that with the information before her at this stage, noting the speed at which the person approached police, yes, she was. The man who was killed is 41-year-old Steve Pampalian. He lived with his parents. Friends of the family arrived to be told the news. His cousin, who didn’t want to be identified, described him as kid, kind, and soft-hearted. The assistant commissioner says she intends to view the officers’ bodycam video this evening. She was asked if she was satisfied that their action was appropriate rather than a taser being used. She replied that with the information that was before her at that stage, and noting the speed at which she understood the person approached police, yes, she was. \\n\\nPeter Overton then reports on the death of Tina Turner at the age of 83. He mentions that she seemed ageless and that there was a great Australian connection with her. The video shows clips of Tina Turner performing, including her involvement in rugby league. Beyoncé paid tribute to Tina Turner, saying, “You are the epitome of power and passion.” Mick Jagger said Tina was inspiring, warm, funny, and generous.

The narrator introduces Chris Ridgeway, a financial advisor who showed a paper profit almost too good to be true. A woman with short blonde hair and pearl earrings is interviewed. She says that they would get reports of what the shares were worth, which kept them all there and quiet. A woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, pink eyeshadow, and a silver V-shaped necklace is also interviewed. She asks what he was telling them the shares were going to increase to, and the other woman replies that it was about $40,000 turning into about $1.6 million or $1.5 million at the highest. A hand is seen flipping through a blue binder filled with papers, revealing charts and graphs. The narrator says that they were good-quality documents with lots of detail, and unsuspecting clients were lambs to the slaughter when confronted with Ridgeway's fast talking and polished marketing props provided by Andy Turner and David Sutton. The narrator continues, saying that the reality was the stocks they'd been assured were about to list never did, meaning their investments were worthless. The woman with shoulder-length blonde hair is now wearing a red blazer and sitting in a blue armchair, looking at the binder. A man with short brown hair and a blue and white checkered shirt is sitting next to her, flipping through the binder. He says that as you can see, they are quite prolific in their production of information. The woman asks if it was a sophisticated scam, and the man replies that it was very sophisticated. The woman asks if Chris Ridgeway believed it was legitimate when he first got involved with the scheme, and the man replies that he did, but by the time he started having doubts, it was too late because he was in so deep. He didn't know what else to do, so he clung onto the idea that it was all going to be fine and people were going to make money. The woman asks if he was living a double life, and the man closes his eyes and puts his hand to his face. The screen shows a graphic of the man surrounded by burning Australian $100 bills, with the words \\\"THE CONFESSION\\\" in gold. The 60 Minutes logo appears, followed by a shot of the man in a gray suit and red and white striped tie walking down a sidewalk. He walks into a building labeled \\\"EXCHANGE SQUARE\\\" with an ASX logo. He walks out of the building and the screen shows a digital stock ticker with red and green numbers. The man looks at a computer screen showing a stock chart. The narrator says that senior advisor and stockbroker Chris Ridgeway breached that trust when he sold investors shoddy products that were worthless and then strung them along for years. Now, before the authorities knock on his door, he's offering up a groveling mea culpa. The man is interviewed again, and the woman asks if he understands that he's hurt a lot of people. He replies yes, and that he's sorry. A yellow MG car is parked in a driveway in front of a house. A man in a black t-shirt and khaki shorts stands in the driveway, and a woman in a white dress and sunglasses gets out of the car. A boy in a black t-shirt and gray shorts runs up to the man and hugs him, and a girl in a school uniform runs up to the woman and hugs her. The family plays basketball in the driveway. The narrator says that the monetary damage Ridgeway has caused can be counted in the millions, but what's immeasurable is the emotional harm he's also inflicted. The man and boy are now wearing gray t-shirts and playing basketball in the driveway. The woman and girl are standing nearby. The man and woman are interviewed again, now wearing a patterned shirt and a black sleeveless turtleneck, respectively. The woman says that their life was on hold for years, and the impact that that had on their marriage and children and the life that they were living was significant. The narrator says that Darren and Kim Walker used to be happily married, but they say Chris Ridgeway put an end to that. The couple is now divorced, but remain united in their determination to expose what Ridgeway did to them. The man says that it was a shame, a big global shame, and probably one of the biggest in terms of the firms involved that he's certainly heard or seen in Australia today. The woman says that they just thought they were doing the right thing investing in a company and investing with someone that they thought was legitimate. The woman with shoulder-length blonde hair is now standing in front of a dark background. She says that the Walkers' ordeal began eight years ago, when they invested $200,000 in financial products spruiked by Ridgeway. Like others, he gave them an early tip on a stock that was about to list on an international exchange. \\\"Trust me, the listing is imminent,\\\" Ridgeway assured them. \\\"You're going to make a lot of money.\\\" Darren and Kim took the bait, but now, eight years later, the stock still hasn't listed. The man says that it was like their life was on hold for years because they were waiting for the six weeks or the three months or whatever, and making plans and trying to do things, and Ridgeway kept saying it was going to happen. The man says that he started to think something wasn't right, and the more he dug, the more he found. The man is seen sitting at a desk with two computer monitors, typing on a keyboard and using a mouse. He picks up a pen and writes on a piece of paper. The narrator says that Darren's detective work was complicated and exhaustive. He became an expert on shelf companies, overseas tax havens, and compliance failures, the scale of which was breathtaking. He discovered that one of the companies he'd invested in, the Australian registered Alt Financial Group, which was supposed to list but didn't, had also been making extraordinary boasts without any backup. The man says that it was a four or five billion dollar unlisted public company in Australia who had two directors, no central office, and had never had an annual general meeting or put out audited accounts since 2017. The man is seen driving a car. He says that as it became clear to Darren and Kim Walker their money was gone, it also became obvious they were far from alone. A man in a white t-shirt is interviewed. He says that they've suffered enormously because there's elements of this that they'll never get back, like the emotion, the stress, and the fact that it ripped their family apart. He says that no amount of money can ever replace that. The man is seen walking into a room with a glass table and chairs. He sits down at the table and opens a laptop. The narrator says that like the Walkers, Jason Hermann's financial future has been destroyed by Chris Ridgeway. Back in 2015, he made a wise decision to give up motorcycle racing to spend more time with his family. But then he made a dreadful decision by asking his racing mate Ridgeway for advice about wealth creation. The man is seen riding a motorcycle on a racetrack. He is wearing a helmet and black leather racing suit. He is seen standing in a garage with other racers and their motorcycles. He is seen standing next to two Porsche race cars, wearing a white racing suit and holding a helmet. The man in the white t-shirt is interviewed again. He says that when he saw Ridgeway in his office at Shaw and Partners, obviously Shaw and Partners are highly reputable, and their presence is far and wide. So the two of them to him seemed like a perfect opportunity. Ridgeway's pitch to Jason was slick and full of promise, an offer to buy shares at a discounted price before the stock was listed. Jason didn't know it then, but Ridgeway was secretly profiting from an elaborate and highly dubious deal allegedly engineered by Englishman Andy Turner and Australian David Sutton. A man in a green hoodie and sunglasses is seen walking down a sidewalk. A man in a light-colored shirt and dark pants is seen walking across a street. The man in the white t-shirt is playing with a small child in a backyard. The narrator says that Jason paid his money, and for the first few years, on paper at least, watched his $200,000 investment balloon. Early on, it was happy days, but as time passed, he realized his shares were really worth nothing, because despite repeated assurances it was about to happen, the stock wasn't ever listed on an exchange. The man is seen sitting at a table, using a calculator and writing on a piece of paper. He is standing in a kitchen, looking at a piece of paper. The narrator says that by early last year, Jason Hermann was so fed up with Chris Ridgeway's lies and excuses, he gave him an ultimatum: pay back the money, or he'd complain to Ridgeway's bosses at Shaw and Partners. Ridgeway panicked. A building with many windows is shown. The narrator says that Ridgeway tried to convince him not to, because of the fear of what was going to happen to him, not whether it was right or wrong, but what was going to happen to him. The man in the checkered shirt is interviewed again. He says that he just ran out of patience, and sat down on a Sunday night and wrote an email to Shaw and Partners. The email is shown on a computer screen. The subject is \\\"Official Complaint\\\" and it is from Jason Hermann. The email says, \\\"Dear Shaw and Partners, My name is Jason Hermann, a non-sophisticated investor and client of your firm since 2015 as I understand it. I believe a sit down meeting is absolutely necessary to resolve…\\\" The man says that it took him about four or five hours because he had to start from the beginning again, right back to 2015, in his complaint to Shaw. It was almost like some type of significant crime had been committed, and he just turned up at the police station and said, \\\"Help.\\\" The man is seen sitting at a table with a laptop. He is looking at the laptop screen with his hands clasped under his chin. The man in the checkered shirt is interviewed again. He says that he stuck his head in the sand, and eventually it didn't work anymore. The narrator says that the music stopped. Chris Ridgeway's scam was finally exposed, as was the true extent of his greed. And, as you'll see, not only was he prepared to rip off his clients, his wife and children weren't spared either. A man in a black leather jacket and sunglasses is seen driving a red Ferrari. He gives a thumbs up to the camera. He is seen standing next to the Ferrari, which is parked in front of a statue. A woman with blonde hair pulled back and black cat-eye glasses is interviewed. She says that she would just like to see him stop hiding and stop lying. The screen shows a graphic of the man surrounded by burning Australian $100 bills, with the words \\\"THE CONFESSION\\\" in gold. The 60 Minutes logo appears. \"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21469133,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18832432},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.27513042,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3380775},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.26740846,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20817901},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.111241356,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17441037}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":2477,"promptTokenCount":801787,"totalTokenCount":804264}}}

To her left is a poster of a shirtless man with tape over his mouth and the words \\\"FRAGILE\\\" written on a piece of tape across his chest. The poster also has the title \\\"WHO'S HUGH?\\\" in lights. The woman begins speaking about Hugh Sheridan, an actor who dared to do what actors are paid to do: act. She explains that Hugh was offered the role of a lifetime, but by accepting it, he offended a minority group who made it their mission to \\\"brutally cancel him.\\\" \\n\\nThe scene transitions to a darkened theater where a man walks onto the stage. The lights come on, illuminating a brick wall backdrop. The camera pans out to show the entire theater. The man on stage is Hugh Sheridan. The narrator explains that for Hugh Sheridan, there's no bitter feeling. He knows he was born to entertain. Hugh is then shown in an interview, saying that if he couldn't perform, he doesn't know what he would do because he loves entertaining people, and that's all he's ever wanted to do since he was little. \\n\\nThe video then shows a montage of Hugh's career, including a music video, scenes from the TV series \\\"Packed to the Rafters,\\\" and an awards ceremony where he accepts an award. The narrator explains that Hugh's big break came in 2008 when he was cast in a lead role in the hit TV series \\\"Packed to the Rafters.\\\" The adulation was instant, and four Logies in five years confirmed Hugh's fame. Hugh is interviewed again, reflecting on his success. He says it's funny because he spent his whole life at drama school, just hoping to get a job and be doing what he's doing, and then as soon as people know who you are, you spend your life with your cap and your head down, trying to just to scoot to the shops and live your life. But it was a huge turnaround, and he's still very grateful for the way it all went down. \\n\\nA photo of Hugh with his castmates from \\\"Packed to the Rafters\\\" is shown. The narrator explains that acting is a notoriously ruthless and competitive profession to pursue, and for more than a decade, Hugh Sheridan made it look easy. But three years ago, everything changed. \\n\\nThe scene transitions to a close-up of Hugh's face in heavy makeup. The narrator explains that at the top of his game, Hugh got the lead part in the Australian production of the Broadway hit \\\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\\\" He thought it would be the role of a lifetime. The truth was, it almost ended his life. Hugh explains that he just took a job, and he didn't know that he was hurting anyone. \\n\\nThe scene transitions to a clip from the play \\\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\\\" The narrator explains that the play is a gay love story set in the Cold War era. Hugh was supposed to play Hedwig, who is forced to have a sex change in order to be with his male lover. Hugh explains that it was a tough role to get because it's a one-person show. You have to be able to be funny, think on your feet, walk in heels, and embody this person that's so conflicting and such a beautiful, dynamic character. The narrator then explains that Hugh was training hard for the role of a lifetime, but then the producers started getting backlash from various people. Hugh says he had no idea, zero idea, that this was happening. \\n\\nThe scene transitions to a close-up of a phone screen showing a petition demanding Hugh be sacked from the play. The narrator explains that from out of nowhere, Hugh was accused of stealing a rare role that should have gone to a transgender actor. Social media went wild with vile threats, and within days, thousands of people had signed a petition demanding he be sacked from the play. Hugh was devastated. He received messages saying that by taking this role, he was transphobic. Hugh says that really shocked him because he hadn't considered that. He says he's not transphobic, and it's offensive to even feel that people could have said that to him, and to his friends who are transgender. They came into battle for him just as hard, and then a week later, he lost his job. The narrator says that's attacking an ally, and Hugh agrees. \\n\\nThe scene transitions to a photo of two men. The narrator explains that the US creators of the play released a statement saying the role should be open to anyone who can tackle it and, more importantly, anyone who needs it. But it had no effect. The cancellation of Hugh Sheridan was vicious and unstoppable. The haters won. The play was ultimately abandoned. Hugh says he had a lot of messages saying things like he was transphobic for taking the role, and that really shocked him because he hadn't considered that. He says he did not want to put his family through that, and he didn't actually want to die. \\n\\nHugh's sister, Zoe, is interviewed. She says that to know that her brother was in that much pain was really hard, and at the time, she just wanted to protect him and put him in a bubble of love because it was very targeted and very on purpose. She confirms that Hugh did try to commit suicide twice. Hugh says it was really dark, and people always resonated with him as a human, and that felt like something had changed. Even though it was from a small group of people, they were the loudest, and at that time, that's all he could hear. He felt very sad, like he was in total shock. He just wanted to get out of there, but he did not want to put his family through that. He didn't actually want to die. \\n\\nThe narrator explains that the attack on Hugh Sheridan was mean and senseless. He was only doing what actors are supposed to do: act, something he's done and loved all his life. Childhood photos of Hugh are shown. Zoe says Hugh had a top hat and a bowler hat at age four. He was always performing. The narrator asks if that precociousness was cute or a bit annoying, and Zoe says it was really cute. The narrator then asks if Hugh was coping flack then from his peers, other students, or from the teachers. Hugh says it was from boys, and he recalls the principal actually calling him out in primary school and telling him that it wasn't normal, and that was in front of everyone. He thinks that was one of those changing moments because when you're a child, you believe it, especially when it's in front of everyone. You believe there must be something wrong. But in the end, he guesses that sort of thing just made him more determined and gave him more of a drive to find where he fit. \\n\\nThe scene transitions to Hugh running along the Sydney Harbour, with the Sydney Opera House in the background. The narrator explains that in many ways, Hugh is still trying to work out where he fits, but in those early days, it seems everyone else already knew. They were convinced he was gay. The narrator asks if Hugh thought he was gay at that stage, and he says no, not at all. He was very much into Valentines, and had his favorite Valentine year after year. He thought he was going to marry her. He also thinks other kids knew that, so they knew he was very much in love with this girl. The narrator says she thought he was in love with two girls at the time, and Hugh says potentially, he was, and he definitely doesn't want to talk about that on TV. He says the narrator has done her research. \\n\\nThe scene transitions to a montage of newspaper headlines about Hugh's sexuality and identity. The narrator explains that rumors about Hugh's love life, sexuality, and identity have followed him throughout his career: gay, straight, bisexual, non-binary. But he's resisted the pressure to confirm or deny, in an attempt to keep his private life out of the public eye, until now. \\n\\nHugh is shown running along the Sydney Harbour again. The narrator explains that three years ago, it was the worst of times for Hugh Sheridan. Now, though, he's had an awakening, both in his personal life and career. Today, he is fitter than ever and working harder than ever, in a job he cherishes. The narrator asks how much Hugh likes telling his own story, and Hugh says he feels very awkward. He loves telling other people's stories, and he thinks that's why he loves acting. The video ends with Hugh performing on stage with a band.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.14414899,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20946948},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12852527,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.14608715},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2893713,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19559398},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.32680812,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.28061664}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1916,"promptTokenCount":843088,"totalTokenCount":845004}}}

The report reveals the network's fragility since the 2017 timetable introduction, attributing it to increased demand, cancellations, and a growing maintenance backlog. The report recommends a 12-month maintenance blitz to address the issues, but the transport minister states there will be no additional funding or service cuts. The opposition criticizes the government's lack of a plan and reliance on a six-year-old timetable. The segment transitions to a story about two suspects leading police on a chase through Bradbury in Sydney's southwest. One suspect is caught after falling through a shed roof, while the other remains at large. The news then shifts to the Lehrmann Inquiry, where a senior police officer states that there wasn't enough evidence against Bruce Lehrmann in the Brittany Higgins rape allegations to take him to trial. The news then moves to a discussion of the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, with the opposition leader calling it a radical change to democracy. The Prime Minister's return from a summit in Japan is mentioned, along with the upcoming referendum on the Voice to Parliament.

The scene transitions to footage of Koletti being escorted out of a building by two men in suits, surrounded by reporters and cameras. The building is identified as the \\\"Forensic Medicine & Coroners Court Complex.\\\" Koletti is wearing sunglasses and a black shirt. He gets into a dark-colored sedan and is driven away. The reporter continues, stating that the case has left a \\\"mess behind.\\\" \\n\\nThe segment cuts back to the news studio, where a male anchor introduces the weather report. Amber Sherlock, the weather reporter, appears on a large screen behind the anchor's desk. She describes the day's weather in Sydney, noting that it was a cold morning but sunny, with clouds moving in during the afternoon. She presents a graph showing the temperature fluctuations throughout the day, with a low of 8.1 degrees Celsius at 7:12 AM and a high of 19.4 degrees Celsius at 12:06 PM. She then discusses the weather in Western Sydney, where the temperature dropped to 2.1 degrees Celsius at 5:59 AM and only reached a high of 18.2 degrees Celsius at 3:35 PM. She mentions showers expected for the following day and promises a full forecast later in the broadcast. \\n\\nThe anchor thanks Amber and previews upcoming stories, including a live interview with the acting commissioner of Fire and Rescue about a fire emergency in Surry Hills, footage of a car crashing onto a sports field in Birrong, bodycam footage from a school shooting in Perth, a story about a paralyzed man walking again, and a royal visit by King Charles and Queen Camilla. \\n\\nAfter a commercial break, the anchor returns and reports on a car crashing into a sports carnival at a primary school in Lidcombe. Footage shows a group of students huddled together on the field before a sedan crashes through a fence and drives onto the field. The students run away. An interview with a resident, Alva Wallace, describes seeing smoke and the car in the middle of the park. A student, Noah Alameddine, recounts hearing a sound and running for his life when the car hit the gate. The anchor states that no one was hit, and the driver, a 71-year-old woman, was helped from the car. Teachers called parents, and Noah's mother, Mariana Chahine, expresses relief after receiving a video message confirming her son's safety. A reporter, James Wilson, reports from the scene, stating that the driver likely suffered a medical episode and is doing fine. He adds that Noah received a kiss and hug from his mother at school drop-off that morning. \\n\\nThe segment transitions back to the studio, where the anchor reports on a fire emergency in Surry Hills. He introduces a live interview with reporter Bianca Balzer and Acting Commissioner Jeremy Fewtrell from Fire and Rescue NSW. Balzer asks about the situation at the fireground, and Fewtrell explains that the fire has been contained but caused substantial damage to two buildings. He describes the fire as intense and fast-developing, posing a significant risk to the community. Balzer asks about an arson investigation, and Fewtrell confirms that a thorough investigation will be conducted in collaboration with police forensics. \\n\\nThe anchor then reports on the release of bodycam footage from a school shooting in Perth. The footage shows police officers entering the school and finding students hiding under their desks. Outside, officers arrest a 15-year-old former student and locate his car, which contains two rifles and a gun bag. Police also find three bullet casings, one on the car's floor mat, and bullet holes in the school's demountable building. WA Premier Mark McGowan visited the school and praised the staff and students for their bravery. In a separate incident, police are searching for a man who robbed a gun store in Busselton, stealing a rifle and ammunition. \\n\\nThe segment shifts to a report on King Charles and Queen Camilla's visit to Northern Ireland, where they opened the Coronation Garden. They were serenaded by a school choir and viewed the garden's motorized pots and spinning trees. \\n\\nIn the news ahead, a preview of a story about a man bus surfing through Sydney's inner southern suburbs. The video was captured along Gardeners Road between Kingsford and Rosebery. \\n\\nNext, a report on a reptile robbery in Kellyville. Three thieves stole two albino pythons from a pet store. The snakes, nicknamed Toasty and Marshmallow, require special care in the lead-up to winter hibernation. Staff are concerned about their well-being. The snakes were later recovered from a St Clair home, and a 17-year-old boy is speaking with police.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Forensic Medicine & Coroners Court Complex\",\n      \"Sydney\",\n      \"Western Sydney\",\n      \"Surry Hills\",\n      \"Birrong\",\n      \"Perth\",\n      \"Coronation Garden, Northern Ireland\",\n      \"Lidcombe\",\n      \"Woods Road, Birrong\",\n      \"Kellyville\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Court case\",\n      \"Weather\",\n      \"Fire emergency\",\n      \"Car accident\",\n      \"School shooting\",\n      \"Royal visit\",\n      \"Reptile theft\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Tiffany Genders\",\n      \"Anthony Koletti\",\n      \"Amber Sherlock\",\n      \"Jeremy Fewtrell\",\n      \"Bianca Balzer\",\n      \"Alva Wallace\",\n      \"Noah Alameddine\",\n      \"Mariana Chahine\",\n      \"James Wilson\",\n      \"King Charles\",\n      \"Queen Camilla\",\n      \"Mark McGowan\",\n      \"Eddie Meyer\",\n      \"Will Densley\",\n      \"Ollie Newman\",\n      \"Elizabeth Bryan\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.05749323,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13296436},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.29259497,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.2861694},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12168585,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.10087854},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08269742,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.19559398}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1330,"promptTokenCount":799723,"totalTokenCount":801053}}}

This weekend, Victoria Police is marking its saddest anniversary. It’s been three years since a drugged truck driver ran down and killed four of its officers on Melbourne’s Eastern Freeway. It was the deadliest day in the history of the force, made even more horrific by a callous Porsche driver who taunted and filmed the dying police and then shared the vision with his friends. Tonight, in a joint investigation with The Age, we can reveal a bizarre twist in the story. The semi-trailer driver, who’s now been convicted and jailed, might not have been behind the wheel that day, but for his boss’s devotion to a little-known hardline religious sect called The Potter’s House.” The camera cuts to the man with the long white beard.

A blonde woman in a purple dress asks Shannon if she was intimate with her ex a week before coming to the experiment. Shannon replies, \\\"Yeah.\\\" The experts are then shown sitting on a brown couch, expressing their disapproval of Shannon's actions. One expert calls it selfish, disrespectful, and beyond belief. The scene shifts to a group of women sitting on couches in a large room, listening to Alessandra, a clinical sexologist. Alessandra explains that sex is one part of intimacy, but it's not the whole of it. She introduces an intimacy week, where the couples are tasked with setting up a perfect romantic date that doesn't have to be sexual. The couples are shown engaging in various romantic activities, such as having dinner, giving foot massages, and hugging. One man expresses his desire to do more hugging with his partner, Claire.

He asks what vegetables his wife likes, noting that she likes broccoli. The man is shown writing in a notebook and shopping for groceries. Alessandra says that effort is really sexy.

Duncan prepares a meal for Alyssa, including olives from their honeymoon and a selection of meats and cheeses. Alyssa says she loves any type of meat. Duncan feeds her a chocolate-covered strawberry.

Josh holds a box labeled \\\"Kiss\\\" and another labeled \\\"Thrill.\\\" He asks how many positions are there in the Kama Sutra, and Melissa says it's torture for her. She says she's envious of the other couples who are diving into intimacy week, while she's alone on the couch. Josh holds a pair of white underwear with a red heart on them. Melissa says this is not living, this is not life, and this is not a relationship. Josh holds a book titled \\\"Kama Sutra.\\\" Melissa says she never thought in her wildest dreams that she would be in a relationship like this. She says Josh complains about wanting an emotional connection, but doesn't let her in. Josh flips through the Kama Sutra. Meanwhile, Shannon is taking on Alessandra's date task, hoping to rekindle the flames with his wife, Caitlyn. He sets up a romantic dinner table with candles and a framed photo of himself and Caitlyn. He lights the candles and looks at the photo. The scene shifts to Shannon and Caitlyn sitting on a couch. The experts ask Shannon when he last saw his ex. Shannon says it was before the experiment, about a week ago. Caitlyn covers her face with her hands. The experts tell Shannon he has a lot of work to do this week, and that Caitlyn needs to feel like he's put the past behind him and she's his number one priority. Shannon says he's all in.

She expresses her opinion about a situation involving Bronte and a married man, stating that if you're married, you shouldn't engage in such behavior. She emphasizes her commitment to marriage and the sacrifices she's made, questioning the point of wasting time on the show if it involves getting other people's numbers. \\n\\nA couple, the man with short brown hair and a beard wearing a black button-down shirt, and the woman with dark hair pulled back wearing a bright blue blazer and large hoop earrings, sit on a dark couch and listen attentively. The woman in yellow continues to express her trust in her partner, Dan, who hasn't given her any reason not to trust him. She asserts that Dan has a good moral compass and their values align. She questions the moral compass of the people from whom the information originated, implying a lack of trust in them. \\n\\nThe woman in blue asks Sandy about her feelings on the situation. Sandy, the woman in yellow, reiterates her trust in Dan and mentions that the information came from people she doesn't trust, particularly Harrison. She explains that she won't believe something coming from Harrison over her partner, who has shown her trust. A woman with long dark hair in a floral one-shoulder dress and gold hoop earrings, sitting next to a man with long dark hair tied in a bun and wearing a brown sweater, expresses her support for Sandy, saying, \\\"Yes, girl.\\\" \\n\\nThe woman in blue then asks Sandy how the experience has helped her relationship. Sandy responds that Dan has seen a side of her that came out yesterday when she got angry. She explains that she's not going to hold back and let people walk all over her. She emphasizes that she's not there for that kind of behavior. \\n\\nThe woman in blue then asks Dan for his perspective. Dan says that it's been a big week, an intimacy week, and it has shed light on many things for them. He expresses his appreciation for Sandy's beautiful mind and stunning appearance, stating his desire to spend another week with her. He refers to her affectionately as \\\"my Pataka.\\\" \\n\\nThe woman in blue then asks Sandy for her decision. Sandy expresses feeling good about how things are going and reveals her decision to stay. The other couples and the three hosts on the brown leather couch applaud. \\n\\nThe scene transitions to the next couple, Tiny and Ollie. Tiny, wearing a pink one-shoulder dress, expresses her growing feelings for Ollie and her pride in him being there with her. She declares him the best husband. Ollie, wearing a gray t-shirt and white sneakers, reciprocates, saying he can't put it into words yet, but the trajectory is positive and has exceeded his expectations. \\n\\nThe woman in blue asks if they have any doubts about their decision. Tiny and Ollie both reveal their decision to stay, holding up cards that say \\\"STAY!\\\" The other couples and the hosts applaud. \\n\\nThe scene transitions to the next couple, Janelle and Adam. Janelle, with long blonde hair, wearing a denim jumpsuit and red lipstick, mentions the fun challenges they faced this week, particularly a photography challenge involving tomatoes and bananas. Adam, wearing a black jacket over a lime green t-shirt, agrees, adding that it was good for them after a difficult previous week. He feels they're in the best place they've been in the experiment. \\n\\nThe woman in blue asks for their decision. Adam reveals his decision to stay, and Janelle follows suit. The other couples and the hosts applaud. \\n\\nThe scene transitions to the next couple, Melinda and Layton. Layton, wearing a beige sweater and ripped jeans, mentions communication styles as their biggest issue, leading to heated arguments. Melinda, with long blonde hair, wearing a white dress, adds that they struggle to have a conversation without one of them getting offended or triggered. The woman in blue advises them to be curious about each other and show that curiosity. She emphasizes the importance of listening and giving each other space. \\n\\nMelinda expresses confidence in their strong position, but acknowledges the need to work on communication. Both Melinda and Layton reveal their decision to stay. The other couples and the hosts applaud. \\n\\nThe scene transitions to the next couple, Alyssa and Josh. Alyssa, wearing a black one-shoulder dress, mentions that the week started rough, but they tried to hit the reset button with dates and quality time. However, she feels the wheels fell off again. She expresses feeling like the alpha in the relationship and finds it awkward to talk about sex, especially since Josh is conservative. Josh, wearing a black jacket and a maroon t-shirt, clarifies that Alyssa's earlier comment about him being a 40-year-old virgin is untrue. He wants to address the significant issue of control in their relationship, accusing Alyssa of attempting to restrict his access to the TV and his mobile phone. \\n\\nAlyssa expresses her disappointment with intimacy week, which she had been looking forward to, but now feels suppressed and uncomfortable talking about sex. Josh mentions that they were intimate on Friday and Saturday, but things haven't been going well the past couple of days. He feels Alyssa is trying to control him. \\n\\nThe woman in blue asks for their decision.

I kind of thrive on that.”\\n\\nThe 60 Minutes logo appears. The announcer says, “Tonight on 60 Minutes.” The camera pans to a swimming pool with people swimming. A photo of the woman and a man is shown. The man says, “She had to turn into a warrior. Ready to fight tooth and nail.” The woman is interviewed.

The announcer says, “Ariarne Titmus reveals her greatest achievements.” A man pushes a sled in a gym. The woman walks on a treadmill. The man is interviewed.

And this is 60 Minutes.”\\n\\nA man is interviewed. He says, “Good evening and welcome to the program. In many ways, it’s rather surprising Ariarne Titmus became an Olympic and world champion swimmer. You see, she’s had to jump so many hurdles growing up. Athletics might have been a more appropriate sport. But this golden girl’s determination to overcome challenges meant success in whatever she chose to do was almost guaranteed. Her willpower and zest for life are strengths she’s had right from day one. And as you’re about to see, there’s a reason for that. Ariarne’s first minutes in this world came perilously close to being her last.”\\n\\nA video of a newborn baby is shown on a large screen. A voice says, “A tiny newborn baby, unable to breathe, and with only a faint heartbeat.” The video is shown on a laptop. The woman is interviewed. She says, “Have you seen the tape of your arrival into this world?” She says, “I knew the story of my birth, how you could almost declare me stillborn. But seeing it was a different thing, and it actually made me quite emotional.” The video is shown on a large screen. The announcer says, “In the panic of the first few minutes of her life, future Olympic gold medalist Ariarne Titmus is almost robbed of her destiny.” The woman is interviewed.

And, um, that was very confronting to see.” A man and a woman look at the video on a laptop. The woman says, “I think they thought here that she had.” The announcer says, “Ariarne’s mother Robin remembers the fear as if it was only yesterday.” The video is shown on a laptop. The woman says, “She wasn’t crying, and they took her, and it seemed to take forever trying to hear, hear that sound, that cry, which didn’t come. And I said, ‘Is she okay?’ And there was no one really telling me that she was.” The announcer says, “Feeling helpless, Ariarne’s dad Steve kept the camera rolling, hoping for a miracle.” The video is shown on a large screen. The announcer says, “And he got it. Tiny Ariarne finally cried.” The video is shown on a laptop. A man says, “There she goes.

The announcer says, “With that first gasp on day one of her life, Ariarne Titmus marked herself as a warrior.” The man and woman are interviewed. The woman says, “She had to fight to survive. And that was where this inner determination, I think, comes from, this incredible will to live.”\\n\\nThe woman is interviewed by a lake. The announcer says, “20 years later, that sheer determination helped the girl from Tasmania fight against all odds to bask in Olympic glory, winning two gold medals.” The woman is shown winning a gold medal at the Olympics.

The announcer says, “Not every Olympic swimmer gets a pool named after them, let alone a 10-meter mural of themselves staring down from the wall.” A mural of the woman is shown. The camera pans to a swimming pool. The man and woman walk by the pool. The man says, “How does it feel to see your name emblazoned on this pool?” The woman says, “Yeah, it’s still very surreal to me. I never thought that the place that I grew up swimming would eventually be named after me. But I don’t think I’ll ever get old seeing that.”\\n\\nThe camera pans to a river. The announcer says, “Born in Tasmania, the state least likely to produce Olympic swimmers, Ariarne blames the lack of champions on the weather.” The man and woman walk by the river. The woman says, “I mean, the pools down here, the outdoor pools are closed for about seven months of the year because it’s too cold to swim outdoors.”\\n\\nThe woman is interviewed. The man says, “Has it helped you with your success, do you think, coming from Launceston, Tasmania, an isolated, cold place in Australia, an island state?” The woman says, “I think coming from Tassie keeps you grounded. This was actually a really great place to grow up. We had a lot of freedom. I think it’s different to grow up in a small town and have a lot of stories to tell than growing up in a big city. And I think you should never forget where, where it all started.”\\n\\nWine is poured into glasses. A group of people toast at a restaurant. The announcer says, “Toasting her success tonight with old friends and family, Ariarne is back here reminiscing about the challenge she faced from Launceston.” The woman talks to a woman at the restaurant. The announcer says, “It all started in 2008 when seven-year-old Ariarne watched the Beijing Olympics.” The woman is interviewed. She says, “And I remember Stephanie Rice winning three gold medals and breaking three world records. And I remember thinking that’s what I want to do. I want to feel that. I want to, I want to be an Olympian.” A photo of the young woman is shown. The announcer says, “And you have no comprehension at that age what it actually takes. But I guess back then, I, I thought I, I thought I could do it.” The man and woman walk by a lake. The announcer says, “Best friend and fellow swim squad member Abby Bagcock still remembers Ariarne’s young dreams to be an Olympian and how it set her apart from the rest of the pack.” The woman hugs another woman. They take a selfie. A photo of the young woman and three other girls is shown. The announcer says, “We would all be eating, like, lollies in the grandstand, and Annie would have her bowl of fruit or, like, something like that. And, yeah, she would always go to that extra effort, and, yeah, get up on the Sunday mornings while we would have a sleep-in, and she’d be in the pool.” The woman says, “Yeah, yeah, training hard, achieving that dream.”\\n\\nThe camera pans to a swimming pool.

He says, “When did you realize this dream, this hope she had, was actually, might, gosh, this could actually happen?” The man says, “I think there was a moment at the Australian Junior Championships where we were sitting in the grandstand, and she won, and there were some kids behind us who were from Melbourne. And I turned around, and they looked at us, and they were shaking their heads, and they were going, ‘You’re from Tasmania?’” The woman says, “Who is this Tasmanian girl that’s come up and beaten a favorite in the last 15 meters?” The man says, “She just meant to win.”\\n\\nThe young woman dives into a swimming pool.

Ridgeway denies it. The narrator then asks how he managed to dupe the compliance system for seven years. Ridgeway claims he told his clients what he was told, leading them to believe their investments were prospering. He denies making the decision to keep his compliance department, state manager, or CEO in the dark. \\n\\nThe scene shifts to a woman sitting on a park bench. The narrator explains that the deception wasn't just directed at Ridgeway's clients. The woman is identified as Carolyn Ridgeway, Chris's wife and mother of his three children. A photo of their wedding is shown. Married for 35 years, Carolyn is mortified by her husband's actions, describing it as the worst thing that has ever happened to her and revealing decades of lies and betrayal. \\n\\nCarolyn is shown again, this time sitting on a different park bench. The narrator explains that she learned the truth when Shaw and Partners sent her a text message saying they had sacked her husband. Carolyn and her daughter were completely blindsided. When her daughter asked what he had done, Ridgeway dismissed it, claiming they didn't understand his business model. He then walked out. Ridgeway admits to being ashamed and wanting to hide, run away, and sort the matter out before returning. He acknowledges that his actions have devastated his children and wife. \\n\\nA photo of Chris and Carolyn Ridgeway enjoying champagne on a boat is shown. The narrator explains that Ridgeway wants people to believe he is remorseful, but leaving his family high, dry, and penniless might have something to do with his fear that Carolyn would discover another betrayal. \\n\\nA document with signatures is shown. The narrator reveals that for years, Ridgeway had been forging Carolyn's signature on financial documents. Carolyn confirms that hundreds of signatures were not hers, dating back to 2008. She was shocked to discover that he had been signing things and using her name for things she was completely unaware of, including listing her as a sole director on companies she had never heard of. Ridgeway admits to forging her signature about a hundred times on documents and putting her into companies as a director without her knowledge. He says he was too stupid to tell her about it. \\n\\nNewspaper headlines about Ridgeway's sacking and subsequent media attention are shown. The narrator explains that Ridgeway's sacking and the media coverage exposed a multi-million dollar scandal that has continued for years. \\n\\nA man in a suit, identified as Stephen Helburg, is shown walking down a city street. The narrator explains that Helburg has an impressive CV, being a trained auditor with 40 years of experience and having held senior roles at corporate giants like Rio Tinto, Orica, and Ernst & Young. In 2016, he was approached by the men Ridgeway named as the masterminds of the scheme, David Sutton and Andy Turner. They wanted credibility to entice and convince investors to invest in their shell companies. Helburg was hired to run a company called Aus Streaming Investments, a proposed mining venture that initially looked good on paper. \\n\\nDocuments related to Aus Streaming Investments are shown. The narrator explains that Helburg soon realized he had been duped. The business had no cash, and he couldn't trace the assets supposedly listed on its balance sheet. The asset value in the balance sheet was $138 million Australian at the time. Six months later, Helburg realized the assets reported in the balance sheet were nonexistent. He contacted the external auditors, who confirmed they had relied on independent valuations provided by Andy Turner. It turned out the valuations were not independent and did not comply with accounting standards. They were prepared by David Sutton. Helburg quit in 2017 and called in his lawyers. He was owed $250,000 in salary, as well as millions of dollars in shares. Needless to say, he is still waiting for the money. \\n\\nHelburg is shown walking in a parking lot and getting into his car. The narrator explains that looking back, he wishes he had never met Andrew Turner or David Sutton or become involved in what he now believes is a highly questionable scheme with many victims. He describes it as the most sophisticated share scheme he has seen in his life. \\n\\nThe narrator explains that 60 Minutes obtained a report by Price Waterhouse Coopers that reveals how they were appointed as a liquidator to find the assets of Aus Streaming Limited. After a year of searching, trawling through records, and visiting vacant offices, they couldn't find anything of value. The report did, however, establish that David Sutton and Andrew Turner were central to the scheme. The authors of the report also called on the financial regulator ASIC to investigate suspicions that Aus Streaming might be involved in misleading and deceptive conduct. \\n\\nThe ASIC logo is displayed on a screen. Helburg says ASIC needs to do much more than that, as the scam continues to this day, enabled by the regulator. He believes they should at least stop it. \\n\\nRidgeway is shown sitting on a bench, looking worried. The narrator explains that for his involvement, Ridgeway is now a very worried man, and as viewers will see, he should be. Ridgeway admits he may end up being charged with fraud and going to jail.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19930841,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17441037},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.16667561,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.24798764},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.33112,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20434219},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.060086742,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13568978}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1437,"promptTokenCount":801788,"totalTokenCount":803225}}}

The man then describes how he was blackmailed with a still image of a video recording of him in a hotel room. He says he did not know he was being recorded and did not consent to it. He felt vulnerable and that it was a subtle threat. The scene shifts to a man in a suit and tie speaking at a podium with a blue background. He says, \\\"President Obama to release his birth certificate.\\\" The scene then shifts to Donald Trump, who is seated in a crowd, smiling. The scene shifts back to the man at the podium, who says, \\\"Just when Jan Carlo thought things couldn’t get any stranger, enter Donald J. Trump and a new deal with the devil.\\\" The scene shifts to Trump standing next to the podium as a man in a suit and tie hands him a framed certificate. The man at the podium says, \\\"Please welcome to Liberty University, for the first time, Doctor Donald Trump.\\\" Trump shakes hands with the man at the podium. The scene shifts to a graphic that reads, \\\"IN TOO DEEP.\\\" The scene shifts to a close-up of a clock face that reads, \\\"60 MINUTES.\\\" The scene shifts to an aerial view of Miami Beach, Florida. The narrator says, \\\"Just as Jan Carlo Granda was trying to step back from his complicated three-way relationship with famous evangelists, Becki and Jerry Falwell Jr., they had a new proposition for him. The Falwells paid eight million dollars to buy the Alton Hostel in Miami and offered Jan Carlo a 24% share in the property in return for him managing it.\\\" The scene shifts to Jan Carlo walking down a sidewalk in Miami. He says, \\\"Jerry said, ‘Well, you know, why don’t we, uh, why don’t we set you up and, you know, start, start business together and you can make your first million and then we’ll celebrate.’ When you’re 20 years old, how can you say no to that? If someone, if you have wealthy investors who are willing to invest in you and give you equity stake in a property in South Beach, you know, you gotta take it.\\\" The scene shifts back to Jan Carlo in the interview room. The narrator says, \\\"There was soon another property mogul on the scene. Jan Carlo was all of a sudden hanging out with then presidential candidate, Donald Trump, a close friend of the Falwells.\\\" The scene shifts to a montage of photographs of Trump, Jerry Falwell Jr., and Jan Carlo. Jan Carlo says, \\\"Trump walks in with Jerry. You know, Jerry points at me. He’s like, ‘Oh, that’s our friend from the Fontainebleau.’ And, uh, Trump, obviously larger than life personality. He’s like, ‘Oh, the Fontainebleau, I love it.’ And, um, you know, we shook hands. He signed my book. He said, uh, ‘Jan Carlo, work hard.’ Uh, it was a pretty cool moment.\\\" The scene shifts to the interviewer, who says, \\\"In the back of your head, though, were you kind of thinking, ‘How did I end up here?’\\\" Jan Carlo says, \\\"Yeah, how did I end up here? That was definitely just kind of going through my, through my mind, but, uh, I go with the flow.\\\" The interviewer says, \\\"Did, did you have a little bit of Stockholm syndrome? Why did you keep, keep it going for so long?\\\" Jan Carlo says, \\\"You’re not the first person to say that, to mention Stockholm, uh, Stockholm syndrome. Uh, yeah, I, I, I guess there’s a part of me that was kind of like, uh, I felt like I was obligated or I kind of had to stick with them. You know, it’s just like, ‘Wow, they’re doing so much for me. I gotta just, even if I feel uncomfortable, I gotta just, uh, bite the bullet and just keep going.’\\\" The scene shifts to Michael Cohen walking out of a courthouse and being surrounded by reporters. The narrator says, \\\"It might seem impossible, but this is where the story gets even stranger. With the arrival of Donald Trump’s then fixer and lawyer, turned prison inmate, Michael Cohen. When sexually compromising photos of Becki fall into the wrong hands, he helps the Falwells get them back. But then, sometime later, Cohen asks for a favor in return. He wants Jerry Falwell Jr. to become the first prominent religious leader to publicly endorse Donald Trump’s presidential nomination.\\\" The scene shifts to a montage of photographs of Trump and Cohen. The scene then shifts to a news report about Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsing Trump. The narrator says, \\\"History shows Donald Trump went on to win the election, in part due to huge support at the polls from the religious right.\\\" The scene shifts to Trump giving a victory speech. The narrator says, \\\"The secret of Michael Cohen’s involvement and the Falwells’ nude photos remained undisclosed for years, until in 2019, the story got even weirder with the intervention of Hollywood actor, Tom Arnold.\\\" The scene shifts to Tom Arnold being interviewed. The interviewer says, \\\"How does a Hollywood star like you end up involved in a story like this?\\\" Arnold says, \\\"Well, it started with Donald Trump, as all, uh, the horrible stories start.\\\" The scene shifts to a montage of photographs of Arnold. The narrator says, \\\"Tom Arnold became a household name in the 90s as an actor and comedian, most notably on the sitcom, Roseanne. But in recent years, he’s reinvented himself as an online sleuth, digging for dirt on Donald Trump.\\\" The scene shifts to Arnold leading a protest. The narrator says, \\\"As part of that, he recorded conversations with Michael Cohen, who opened up to him in 2019 about the Falwell photographs that Team Trump had acquired during the campaign.\\\" The scene shifts to a montage of tweets and photographs related to the story. Arnold says, \\\"There’s a bunch of photographs, you know, personal photographs that somehow the, the guy ended up getting. Oh. Whether it was off of Jerry’s phone or somehow maybe it got air dropped or whatever the hell the whole thing was. Even though she’s a, she’s a very nice figure, um, you know, nobody wants there. No. You know, they’re, they’re private photos, Tom. And Michael Cohen went to him and said, ‘Hey, Jerry, uh, the naked pictures of your wife, et cetera. Uh, well, I still got one of the pictures. And, uh, I need you to do me a favor for my boss. It’ll really make me look good if you support him, support Donald Trump.’ And that’s the reason, you know, it was payback for the naked pictures.\\\" The interviewer says, \\\"The photos that Michael Cohen said he had, did you ever see them yourself?\\\" Arnold says, \\\"Yes. The picture was very, very, very, very intimate post lovemaking picture. And whatever you take that as you, that’s all I could say on your network.\\\" The scene shifts to Arnold driving a car. The narrator says, \\\"Critically, at the time, Tom Arnold also became aware the Falwells had struck an unusual business deal with a young man they met at a hotel in Miami by the name of Jan Carlo Granda. Jan Carlo was trying to move on with his life by then, but the Falwells had locked him into this business arrangement, and Becki continued to hit on him.\\\" The scene shifts to an aerial view of Miami Beach. The narrator says, \\\"The descendant of Mexican migrants was now also disgusted that the Falwells had helped put Donald Trump in office.\\\" The scene shifts to Jan Carlo standing on a sidewalk in Miami. He says, \\\"When I first met Donald Trump in 2012, I liked him. I admired him. Uh, but obviously that changed in, uh, around 2016 with his comments about Mexicans. I’m half Mexican. My mom is from Mexico. So immediately I was just kind of turned off by him. By the, I, I just, um, I don’t think that he should be the representative of the United States. I don’t think that he should have the nuclear codes.\\\" The scene shifts to a crowd of Trump supporters. The scene then shifts to Trump giving a speech. The narrator says, \\\"The Falwells thought they could keep Jan Carlo silent. But little did they know, he had a smoking gun that was about to expose their hypocrisy to the world.\\\" The scene shifts to Jan Carlo on a video call with Becki Falwell. The interviewer says, \\\"Did Jan Carlo Granda bring down a dynasty?\\\" Another interviewee says, \\\"I, you know, I’d like to think so.\\\" The scene shifts to Jan Carlo boxing in a gym. The narrator says, \\\"For the better part of a decade, Jan Carlo Granda rolled with the punches as life threw all sorts of combinations at him. Nowadays, keeping active is critical in him staying in control of his mental health. But four years ago, he was spiraling, living in a seemingly inescapable nightmare of a controlling sexual and business relationship with Becki and Jerry Falwell Jr.\\\" The scene shifts to a photograph of Becki and Jerry Falwell Jr. The interviewer says, \\\"Do you think the Falwells are predators?\\\" Jan Carlo says, \\\"Right, so like, you know, groom, whenever someone says groom me, you think of like, oh, it has to be like a kid or something. But no, I, I believe anyone can be groomed for anything, right? Especially if you hold power over them.\\\" The interviewer says, \\\"Dark is, is, is almost, uh, a kind way of describing it. I mean, you were in a, you were in a bad place.\\\" Jan Carlo says, \\\"Yeah, I was definitely in a bad place. I mean, I, I, I feel like I was used.

The timer has a black background with red numbers and the words \\\"MINUTES\\\" written in red. The hands of the timer are silver. The camera then cuts to a woman sitting on a stool in front of a large screen. The screen displays a graphic with the words \\\"The Confession\\\" in gold letters, the name \\\"Naomi Shivaraman\\\" in white letters, and the word \\\"Producer\\\" in white letters. The graphic also features a picture of a man with a sad expression on his face, and a pile of burning money. The woman is wearing a black blazer and black pants. She has short blonde hair and is smiling. She introduces herself as Tara Brown and welcomes the audience to 60 Minutes. She explains that the episode will expose a dubious global financial scheme that is happening right now. She says that hundreds of Australian families and thousands around the world are caught up in the scheme, and that many victims don't know their life savings are missing. She says that the total losses could be in the millions of dollars. She then explains that one of the key players involved has decided to confess, and that after authorities hear what Chris Ridgeway has to say to reporter Adele Ferguson, a prison cell might be his next home.\\n\\nThe camera then cuts to a black Porsche Macan SUV with the license plate \\\"RIDGYS\\\" parked in a parking lot. A man in a blue shirt and denim shorts walks towards the car and gets in. He starts the car and drives away. The camera follows the car as it drives down a winding road through a forest. The narrator explains that the noisy black Porsche is supposed to make Chris Ridgeway look successful, but the truth is that his spoils are ill-gotten. The narrator says that Ridgeway is a con man, plain and simple.\\n\\nThe camera then cuts to Ridgeway sitting in a chair in a hotel room. He is wearing a blue and white checkered shirt. He asks about his hair and makeup. The narrator explains that Ridgeway is about to do something highly unusual: he is going to confess. The camera then cuts to a close-up of Ridgeway's face. He says that he doesn't want to think of himself as a crook, but that some of his actions in recent times have been terribly wrongful. He says that he is ashamed and sorry, and that he has no self-respect or self-worth. He says that he struggles to look at himself in the mirror.\\n\\nThe camera then cuts to Ridgeway walking down a set of stairs. He is wearing a gray suit and a red tie. The narrator explains that for years, Ridgeway was employed at one of Australia's biggest and most reputable financial broking houses, Shaw and Partners. He was a respected and trusted senior advisor, which made it easy for him to cheat his clients and friends out of their savings. But now, he wants us to believe he's a con with a conscience.\\n\\nThe camera then cuts to Ridgeway walking down a city street. He is wearing a gray suit and a red and white striped tie. The narrator explains that Ridgeway wants to prove his remorse by exposing a global financial scheme that is still operating right now. He has promised to tell the truth about his role in the scheme, how his clients were impacted, and how many of them were left destitute. The camera then cuts to a group of people sitting at a table in a room. The narrator explains that people all around the world have been lured into the scheme, and that it's not only the loss of their savings that hurts, but also the embarrassment they feel because the truth was so simple. The camera then cuts to Ridgeway standing with his back to the camera, looking up at a tall building. The narrator explains that Ridgeway and many other advisors like him used their positions to convince investors to buy financial products that had no real value. The camera then cuts back to Ridgeway sitting in the chair in the hotel room. He says that he knows that now, but he didn't think that was the case when he started. He says that he is trying to tell people he's sorry and be honest with himself. He says that his life is at rock bottom and he's trying to tell people he's sorry.\\n\\nThe camera then cuts to a montage of photos of Ridgeway on lavish vacations and driving expensive cars. The narrator explains that Ridgeway took $1.6 million in kickbacks, which he spent on flash cars and lavish overseas holidays. Of course, his clients had no idea their savings were supporting his extravagant lifestyle. The camera then cuts to a woman with short white hair and small pearl earrings sitting in a car. She is wearing a pink and white striped shirt. She is putting on her seatbelt. The narrator explains that unlike Ridgeway's wheels, Leith Reynolds' car isn't about showing off. She's supposed to be retired, but thanks to her once-trusted financial advisor, she needs it for work. The narrator explains that Ridgeway proposed a plan to improve Leith's financial security. He told her he knew a stock that was about to list on an overseas exchange, and if she got in early, she'd make a fortune. Leith handed over the last $20,000 from her late husband's life insurance. That wasn't enough, however, for Ridgeway. He rang Leith and asked if she had any more money because the deal was so good. He told her he'd invested his whole inheritance in it, and he convinced her to transfer $20,000 out of her super fund as well. Leith says that Ridgeway never told her he was getting a commission, and that it wasn't just a standard commission, but a massive commission. She says that it's horrible to think he was grooming her from then, and that he would have been aware that she would have some sort of insurance payout. She says that she wasn't flush with money, being a stay-at-home mom. The camera then cuts to Leith making coffee in her kitchen. She is wearing a pink and white striped shirt and black shorts. The narrator explains that for a while, Leith believed her investment was a winner. Ridgeway seemingly sent regular communication. The camera then cuts to Leith standing at a fence, looking at the city skyline. The narrator explains that Ridgeway told Leith that he knew a stock that was about to list on an overseas exchange, and if she got in early, she'd make a fortune. He convinced her to transfer $20,000 out of her super fund as well. He told her he'd invested his whole inheritance in it. The narrator explains that Ridgeway did it off the books, and that he knew it was wrong. He said that they would pay him a decent commission, and that he was greedy and desperate for money. He made the decision to do something for himself, and it was the wrong decision to make. The camera then cuts to a montage of photos of Ridgeway on lavish vacations and driving expensive cars. The narrator explains that it's illegal for financial advisors to take secret commissions, but Ridgeway did it anyway. He took $1.6 million in kickbacks, which he spent on flash cars and lavish overseas holidays. Of course, his clients had no idea their savings were supporting his extravagant lifestyle. The camera then cuts to Leith sitting at a table with another woman. They are looking at photos. Leith points to a photo of Ridgeway at her husband's funeral. She explains that Ridgeway was a close friend of her husband, Mark, and even a pallbearer when he died. She says that at that stage, Ridgeway was very much a trusted member of their friendship group. But as she grieved, it's clear Ridgeway saw an opportunity and a target. She says that it's horrible to think he was grooming her from then, and that he would have been aware that she would have some sort of insurance payout. She says that she wasn't flush with money, being a stay-at-home mom. He convinced her to transfer $20,000 out of her super fund as well.

Professor Jocelyn Bloch, a neuroscientist, explains that the patient has to learn how to work with his brain signals, and the team has to learn how to correlate these signals to the spinal cord stimulation. Gert-Jan is the first and only patient the digital bridge has been tested on. He mentions that within five to ten minutes, he could control his hips. The scene shows Gert-Jan walking with assistance in various settings, including outdoors and indoors. Scientists say some of the improvements have remained even after the technology was switched off.

Light showers are expected across southern, central, and coastal New South Wales, with possible snow down to 1200 meters and light falls about the central tablelands. It will be cold and windy for most of the state, with temperatures several degrees below average. There is a gale-force wind warning from Byron all the way down to the Illawarra coast and a strong wind warning for the far south. In Sydney, it will be cloudy tomorrow with showers and moderate to fresh northwesterly winds, which will be stronger along the coast. There is a 70% chance of up to 6 millimeters of rain in the city and just one or two millimeters, if any, in the west. The cloud cover will give a milder night tonight. Tomorrow, temperatures will reach 17 to 18 degrees across the western suburbs, 16 to 18 degrees across the coast. Looking ahead, the skies will clear up for the weekend, with sunshine and tops of 18 to 19 degrees.

Bronte says, \\\"There was a few little hiccups that just don't really need to be discussed.\\\" Bronte and Harrison are shown sitting on the green couch. The narrator asks Harrison, as a married man, why he took the number of a girl. Harrison says, \\\"In the moment, I felt like I was just being sympathetic to her feelings.\\\" Bronte is asked if that didn't make her question things. Bronte says, \\\"I know that women are gonna hit on him. I get it. It's human nature. It happens. He's a good-looking guy. I'm choosing to trust him. And if at the end of this, I end up with egg on my face, then it's a lesson learned.\\\" Bronte carries a garbage bag into the apartment. Harrison says, \\\"What have you got?\\\" Bronte says, \\\"I'm going to have to buy another suitcase just to go home.\\\" She says, \\\"Yeah, I'm feeling really positive about Harrison today.\\\" Bronte holds a bottle of wine. She says, \\\"Happy days.\\\" Harrison says, \\\"Sick.\\\" The scene shifts to the brick building with the \\\"SKYE SUITES\\\" sign. The narrator explains that as Bronte basks in her reunion with Harrison, the real success story everyone is talking about is Claire and Jesse. Dan says, \\\"I mean, who would have thought after last week's commitment ceremony? What a turnaround. Claire and Jesse, we saw two people that were really disconnected in the first commitment ceremony. But last night, I saw two people that actually wanted to both be there for the right reasons and wanted to be there for each other.\\\" Alyssa says, \\\"I love this side of Jesse. He is so fun-loving, caring. He is clearly into her. So I'm hoping she's able to lean into that a bit more this week.\\\" Jesse is shown shirtless in bed, using a laptop. He puts on a black t-shirt. A framed photo of Claire and Jesse at their wedding is on the nightstand. Jesse is shown sitting on the green couch with Claire. The narrator asks Jesse how he would describe the feelings he's starting to develop for Claire. Jesse says, \\\"I wouldn't have reacted to certain things last week if I wasn't feeling a certain way about Claire. So, yeah, I like it.\\\" The narrator says, \\\"You've got romantic feelings for her.\\\" Jesse says, \\\"Yeah.\\\" The narrator asks, \\\"Are you physically attracted to Claire?\\\" Jesse laughs and says, \\\"Yeah.\\\" Claire laughs. Jesse says, \\\"Man, I felt so connected to Claire. My heart sang in that moment. Every day, I'm feeling more and more attracted to Claire.\\\" Jesse irons a shirt. He says, \\\"Sometimes she will laugh, and she does this like funny little chuckle.\\\" Jesse laughs. He says, \\\"That gets my heart going, too. Yeah.\\\" The scene shifts to the \\\"SKYE SUITES\\\" sign. The narrator explains that despite new beginnings and happy reunions, one person isn't feeling quite so elated. Claire lies in bed, looking sad. The framed photo of her and Jesse is on the nightstand. Claire says, \\\"Hearing him say in the commitment ceremony couch that he's getting feelings for me, you know, it's hard because I feel so guilty. He doesn't know the truth. I'm carrying this big secret. I just can't hold it in anymore. I need to tell somebody.\\\" Claire walks down a hallway and knocks on Sandy's door. Sandy says, \\\"Hi, babe. Do you have a minute?\\\" Claire and Sandy sit at a table. Claire says, \\\"I'm a little bit stressed, and I've had something weighing on my mind because I feel like I've done the wrong thing. And I thought I would tell you because I respect your advice and your decisions, and I think that you'll be able to help me gain some clarity around what to do.\\\" Sandy says, \\\"Look, I'm not here to judge. Whatever you've done, babe, let it out, and we'll talk it out.\\\" Claire says, \\\"So you know that night that we went out all together?\\\" A video clip shows Claire, Adam, and other people at a bar. Claire says, \\\"Adam and I… we kissed.\\\" Sandy says, \\\"Claire, I know. It's so wrong of me. I know.\\\" Claire says, \\\"I didn't mean to hurt anyone. Like, I feel so bad. No, I just disrespected this whole process.\\\" Sandy says, \\\"The point is you're going to say it now. Focus on that. It's fine. Yes, Janelle's got to know. Jesse's got to know that.\\\" Claire blows her nose. Sandy says, \\\"And look, you've come forward. If it was up to Adam, I don't know if it ever would have come out.\\\" Adam pours water into a mug. He says, \\\"Nah.\\\" Sandy says, \\\"He's been messaging me, 'Don't tell anyone.'\\\" Claire says, \\\"What? He's been saying that?\\\" Sandy says, \\\"Yeah.\\\" Claire says, \\\"I know she's under a lot of pressure. She's stressed. She's worried about it because she also knows that Adam doesn't have her back.\\\" Sandy says, \\\"How's that supposed to make her feel? Of course, she's thinking I can't tell anyone because if I say something, he's going to deny it. You need to talk now. This is your chance.\\\" Claire says, \\\"No, I just… I call myself out on my bullshit just as much as I call out others on theirs. I feel really awful for hurting Janelle and for hurting Jesse. And if I left here, if I left here, I would just… I would want to leave at least being a hypocrite and not being a liar.\\\" Claire cries. Sandy comforts her. Claire says, \\\"I should have said the truth sooner. Like, I should have.\\\" Sandy says, \\\"He's been saying like, 'Don't tell anyone.'\\\" Claire says, \\\"Yeah.\\\" Sandy says, \\\"I know she's under a lot of pressure. She's stressed. She's worried about it because she also knows that Adam doesn't have her back. How's that supposed to make her feel? Of course, she's thinking I can't tell anyone because if I say something, he's going to deny it. You need to talk now.

He says that everyone has gone quiet and asks if they want to hear what he has to say. A woman in a light green dress drinks from her wine glass. Another woman says yes, and Shannon asks if they want to hear it. A man with a mustache looks on. A woman in a pink dress says yes, let’s discuss it, but if they don’t want to, it’s okay. Shannon says he wants to know what’s been going on because there has been a real different vibe the last couple of days. A blonde woman looks on. A man in a brown suit speaks. A woman in a pink dress adjusts her earring. Another woman asks what’s going on and what Shannon means by a different vibe. Shannon asks her what she asked him before. The woman in the light green dress says that on the weekend, she was with someone she assumed was Shannon’s daughter and the other person was her mom. Shannon says it wasn’t who she thought, and it wasn’t his ex or his kid. The woman in the light green dress says okay. A woman in a white dress says thank God repeatedly. Shannon reveals it was his cousin and second cousin. The woman in the white dress says amazing. The woman in the light green dress says that’s why she’s asking Shannon because she doesn’t know, as she hasn’t seen any of them. Shannon, who is now facing the camera, says he caught up with his cousins on the weekend. He says Claire poked it out and thought she was getting the upper hand, that she thought she found something amazing, not amazing, but drama, but she didn’t. The woman in the white dress asks if they can describe the cousin and the ex to make sure they are different people. A blonde woman says oh my God. The woman in the light green dress says she knows. The woman in the white dress says she knows. Shannon says it’s good. The woman in the light green dress says valid. The woman in the white dress says valid. The woman in the pink dress says oh my God. The woman in the light green dress says valid. A man in a brown suit looks on. A man in a tan shirt eats. The woman in the pink dress says his cousin. A woman off-screen says what fascinates her is that Shannon isn’t aware that only a week ago, he went on a couch and said he was in love with his ex. Shannon says it’s understandable for people to assume that the woman he was spotted with was his ex. The woman in the light green dress says there was honestly barely any interaction, and she barely took any of it in. She thinks there was a redhead girl. Shannon says Claire definitely did. He asks what she said. The woman in the light green dress says she didn’t hold a kid and thought she was like 10 to 12 years old. Shannon says she’s four. The woman in the light green dress says she didn’t realize Shannon’s child was four and had no idea. Shannon says he came down from Queensland for coffee. The woman in the light green dress says she didn’t know anything about it, and she’s literally had three sentences with Shannon. Shannon says it doesn’t matter. The woman in the light green dress says no. Shannon drinks from his wine glass. The woman in the white dress says she didn’t realize Shannon’s child was four. Shannon says he knows. The woman in the white dress says she had no idea. Shannon says he knows. The woman in the white dress says she didn’t know anything. Shannon drinks from his wine glass. The woman in the light green dress says for her, it was the fact that Shannon said K, did you see his face. Shannon laughs. The woman in the light green dress says this is a tricky one. She has found Shannon’s response a little bit hard to swallow. She says she’s not going to lie. The woman in the white dress says she knows. Shannon says thank God. The woman in the white dress says thank God. The woman in the light green dress says she doesn’t know. She says innocent until proven guilty, and if Shannon was a witch, they’d burn him at the stake. She says maybe because he’s a male, he gets the benefit of the doubt. Shannon drinks from his wine glass. A cityscape is shown at night. Wine is poured into glasses at a dinner table. A man and woman sit at a dinner table. The man says he’s having a great time. The woman says yeah. Another man says he’s good. The first man and woman kiss. A woman says aww, just kiss him.

She can’t be drawing herself in. A woman says here we go, what’s going on here. Janelle knows something. The woman says she does. Another woman says it’s a girl on girl thing. Another woman says she overheard information. She apologizes. She says she doesn’t know what the right thing to do is because it’s not her information to share, but if she was in Sandy’s position, she’d want to know. She asks if she should say it. A man says it’s completely up to her. The woman says Tony, Tony, Tony. She asks if he wants to go for a chat. The woman says what’s happening. She needs advice. Another woman asks if it’s about the girls. She asks what the go is. The first woman says Adam. The second woman asks if everything is alright.

The second woman says maybe they say something to Dan. The first woman says oh, she doesn’t know. She says Adam is sitting there, losing his mind. She says because he’s the one that found the information. The second woman says she knows. The first woman says so, Harrison and Adam were on the phone, and she overheard Harrison mention that Dan got a girl’s number. The first woman says she knows. A man says he personally doesn’t see it as a big deal, which is why he didn’t tell Bronte about it.

The woman is pushing a shopping cart with a few items in it. The reporter is holding a microphone and asking the woman about the prices of groceries. The woman says that she looks at the price of items more now and chooses based on that. The video then cuts to a graphic showing the increase in prices of fresh and dry groceries in the year to April. Fresh groceries rose by 9.9%, dry groceries rose by 9.4%, Vegemite and tomatoes rose by 8%, and yogurt rose by 14%. The video then cuts back to the supermarket, where a man is pushing a shopping cart. The video then cuts to an interview with James Hepworth, the Commercial Director of Woolworths. He says that the cost increase of groceries is beginning to moderate, meaning that price increases are starting to slow. The video then cuts to a graphic showing that Woolworths is slashing the price of 450 winter essentials, including chicken, pasta, potatoes, and ice cream. The video then cuts to a Coles supermarket, where a cashier is scanning items. The video then cuts to an interview with Dr. Eloise Zoppas, from the Australian Centre for Retail Studies at Monash University. She says that people are looking for low-cost alternatives when it comes to groceries, so they are changing brands or looking at different products altogether. The video then cuts back to the supermarket, where a reporter is talking about how supply chain issues caused by COVID and floods are now subsiding, making it easier for supermarkets to get products onto the shelves. The video then cuts to a graphic showing the price of unleaded petrol across Sydney. The average price is $1.754 per liter. The cheapest petrol can be found at Condell Park and Revesby, where it is $1.603 per liter. The video then cuts back to the news studio, where the news anchor is talking about a state memorial service for Barry Humphries that will be held on December 15th. Thousands are expected to attend the service, which will take place at the Sydney Opera House. The video then cuts to a weather report. The weather reporter says that it will be cold and clear tonight, dipping to between 4 and 8 degrees. The current temperature in the city is 14 degrees, and 11 degrees in the west. The weather reporter then gives the forecast for tomorrow. She says that it will be another cold and blue sky day for most of the state, with westerly winds adding a wind chill. Many inland areas will dip below freezing once again overnight. Coastal areas will be a little warmer, ranging from 19 degrees in Bega and Batemans Bay to 23 in Grafton. Sydney can look forward to more beautiful blue skies tomorrow with light winds, but it will be very cold once again, especially in the morning. Temperatures will fall to lows of 1 to 4 degrees overnight in the west, and then warm up to tops of around 20 to 21, including Kellyville, Parramatta, and Liverpool. Coastal areas will dip between 6 and 9 degrees tonight, before reaching a top of 18 tomorrow in Terry Hills, 20 in Gosford and the city, and 19 in Cronulla. The outlook for the week is sunny on Tuesday and Wednesday, with tops of 20 to 22 degrees. There is a possible shower or two on Friday, bringing up to 4 millimeters of rain.

A man with a beard, wearing a beige shirt with a small logo on the chest, is seen listening intently to someone off-screen. \\n\\nAn aerial shot of a city at night follows, showing a large, dark building with illuminated windows. The surrounding area is mostly dark, with scattered lights from houses and streets. \\n\\nBack at the dinner table, various interactions unfold.

He says that two women were very upset when they realized they were in a lot of trouble. The video then shows footage of police officers searching luggage and finding packages of drugs. The narrator says that the drugs were found in the women's cabin and in a room occupied by a Canadian man they were traveling with. The street value of the drugs was more than $20 million, and it was the largest drug bust of its kind on board a cruise ship. The video then shows a couple sitting in a living room. The man says that they found out about what happened on the news. The video then shows a news report about the drug bust. The reporter says that the two Canadian women are behind bars. The video then shows a montage of photos of the women traveling the world in luxury. The video then shows the couple again. The man says that they didn't feel worried for the women because they had done the wrong thing. The video then shows a photo of one of the women sunbathing on a cruise ship. The video then shows the couple again. The man says that the women were having fun and not expecting to get caught. The video then shows a prison cell door closing. The narrator says that the women were charged with importing a commercial quantity of cocaine and were facing life behind bars. The video then shows a courthouse. The narrator says that the prospect of life in prison fractured the friendship of the once inseparable partners in crime. The video then shows photos of the women together. The narrator says that while Isabelle pleaded guilty almost immediately, Melina tried unsuccessfully to pin the whole operation on her mate. The video then shows Isabelle speaking in an interview. She says that she put herself in that situation, and she knew exactly what she was getting herself into. The narrator says that Isabelle's honesty was acknowledged, and she spent just four and a half years in jail. The video then shows Melina's mugshot. The narrator says that the judge saw through Melina's attempt to distance herself from the job and handed her an eight-year sentence. The video then shows the judge speaking in court. She says that she doubts Melina is now the envy of others. The video then shows two men walking toward a boat. The narrator says that there's no doubt the Australian Border Force operation was a success. The video then shows the men getting on the boat. The narrator asks the police officer if it's frustrating to him that they grabbed the mules but not the organizers. The officer says that it is greatly frustrating, but the people who are organizing these operations are smart and have purposely removed themselves. There are several layers between the mules and the actual people running the operations. The video then shows Isabelle in a car at night. The narrator says that for all of Isabelle's honesty, there's one truth she's still not revealing, and that's who put her up to it. The video then shows the couple walking down the street. The man says that whoever it is, the scheme was doomed from the start. He says that the people who came up with the idea should have been sacked. He says that they should have just got a couple of old grandmothers, and they would have gotten away with it. The video then shows Isabelle sitting in a bar. The narrator says that Isabelle has learned the most valuable lesson of her life, and she's now more than happy to leave the criminal enterprises to someone else. The video then shows Isabelle standing on a bridge. She says that this story changed her completely. She says that she doesn't know who she would be today or where she would be if she didn't get caught. She says that she would have probably been a big asshole with a lot of money. She says that this lifestyle is behind her, and she just wants peace and quiet, a normal life with friends, family, and travel, and no luggage full of cocaine. The video then cuts to a commercial break. After the break, the video shows a man in a suit sitting in front of a giant game of Snakes and Ladders. He talks about the economic situation in Australia and how it is affecting people. He says that there was a small drop in inflation, but the number is still way too high. He says that the only thing worse than high interest rates is high inflation. He says that the Reserve Bank has to tame the inflation beast. He says that in about 48 hours, we'll know for sure if the Reserve Bank has the mettle to tame the inflation beast. He says that in the meantime, it might be wise to assume the brace position. The video then shows a woman sitting on a train looking at her phone. She is reading a news article about a woman whose rent has been increased by $350 a week. The narrator says that a rental crisis is just one of the many knock-on effects of soaring inflation in Australia this last year. The video then shows the woman being interviewed in her kitchen. She says that she is struggling to make ends meet and that the rent increase will tip her over the edge. She says that she might have to move back in with her mother. The video then shows the man in the suit again. He says that the financial stress is very real for so many Australians right now. He says that it's a symptom of the cost of living pressures we've all been enduring for months on end. He says that while the high prices may have peaked, they're taking way too long to come back down. He says that we might not like what we're about to hear, but economists say it's time for Australia to accept some brutal home truths. The video then shows a man with a mustache and glasses being interviewed. He says that there are no easy options and that we either have to choose high inflation or high interest rates. He says that the US went all the way, and they're one and a half percentage points above Australia. He says that it's because inflation just wasn't coming down as quickly as they wanted it to. He says that we think it will in Australia, and we're crossing our fingers and hoping everything will be fine. He says that that's not a good strategy for macroeconomics. He says that the only thing worse than high interest rates is high inflation. He says that it's something we cannot tolerate. He says that as hard as it is for people paying mortgages, it's even harder if you've got ramping inflation. He says that we've got to keep some perspective about it. He says that if you think an interest rate rise is unpalatable, wait until you hear just how many hikes this economist thinks Australia needs if it wants to get serious about bringing inflation down. He says that he'd be very surprised if rates didn't get above 5%. He says that to get to the fives, we're not talking one or two interest rate rises. He says that we're talking six, seven more interest rate rises to get inflation under control. He says that there's a reason the US went all the way.

In this scene, a group of women and a group of men are having a conversation with Alessandra Rampolla, a sexologist. The conversation is about sex toys and intimacy. \\n\\nAlyssa, a 35-year-old executive assistant from NSW, shares that she has never owned a vibrator. She seems embarrassed but also excited about the topic. Alessandra reassures her and encourages her to try out the sex toys in the box she has been given. The other women laugh and seem supportive of Alyssa. \\n\\nLater, the men join the conversation. Some of them express their opinions about sex toys, with some saying they love them and others saying they don't need them. Alessandra explains that sex toys are not meant to replace a partner but to enhance the sexual experience. She also talks about the importance of communication and intimacy in a relationship. \\n\\nThe scene then shifts to the couples going on dates. Harrison, a 32-year-old builder from NSW, expresses his hope that he can teach his partner, Alyssa, something new. Bronte, a 28-year-old online beauty educator from WA, hopes that Harrison takes the date seriously. Jesse, a 30-year-old marriage celebrant from WA, reflects on his conversations with Alessandra and how confident she is when talking about sex. He wonders if the topic is too taboo to discuss. \\n\\nAlessandra asks the men about the best places to touch women to turn them on. One of the men suggests the collarbone. Alessandra then asks them how they feel about sex toys. Some of the men say they love them, while others say they don't need them. Alessandra argues that no one needs a sex toy, just like no one needs utensils to eat steak, but that they can enhance the experience. She encourages the men to expand the possibilities of sensations they can experience. \\n\\nThe scene ends with Alessandra giving the men a challenge: to set up the perfect romantic and intimate date for their partners. The grooms seem excited about the challenge and start planning their dates. Ollie, a 26-year-old voice-over artist from WA, plans to recreate his Fijian honeymoon for his wife, Tahnee. He goes to the dollar store to buy decorations and prepares coconuts for drinks. He expresses his hope that the date will help him and Tahnee reconnect and reflect on their honeymoon. \\n\\nIn a later scene, Josh, a 40-year-old advertising client director from NSW, is having a conversation with his partner, Melissa. Melissa tells Josh that he has a problem with intimacy and that she doesn't know how to fix it. Josh seems upset and unsure if he can continue in the experiment. \\n\\nThe video ends with a shot of the Sydney skyline at night.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      {\n        \"location\": \"A living room with a green painting on the wall\",\n        \"scene\": \"Alessandra talks to the women about sex toys.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"A living room with a brick wall and a large window\",\n        \"scene\": \"Alessandra talks to the men about sex toys and intimacy.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Various apartments\",\n        \"scene\": \"The couples go on dates.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"A living room with a large window and a view of the city\",\n        \"scene\": \"Alessandra gives the men a challenge to plan a romantic date.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Ollie and Tahnee's apartment\",\n        \"scene\": \"Ollie prepares a romantic date for Tahnee.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"location\": \"Josh and Melissa's apartment\",\n        \"scene\": \"Josh and Melissa have a conversation about intimacy.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Sex toys\",\n      \"Intimacy\",\n      \"Communication\",\n      \"Romance\",\n      \"Relationships\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Alessandra Rampolla\",\n        \"role\": \"Sexologist\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Alyssa\",\n        \"role\": \"Executive Assistant, NSW\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Harrison\",\n        \"role\": \"Builder, NSW\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Bronte\",\n        \"role\": \"Online Beauty Educator, WA\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Jesse\",\n        \"role\": \"Marriage Celebrant, WA\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Josh\",\n        \"role\": \"Advertising Client Director, NSW\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Melissa\",\n        \"role\": \"Josh's partner\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Ollie\",\n        \"role\": \"Voice Over Artist, WA\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Tahnee\",\n        \"role\": \"Ollie's partner\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Sandy\",\n        \"role\": \"Dan's partner\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Dan\",\n        \"role\": \"Digital Business Owner, QLD\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.13117331,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13568978},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12852527,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1968261},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.08756394,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1550786},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"HIGH","probabilityScore":0.83223677,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM","severityScore":0.6090595}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1217,"promptTokenCount":1186763,"totalTokenCount":1187980}}}

She’s talking to someone out of view, who is standing with their back to the camera and wearing a black t-shirt. The woman says, “This morning, the only thing that we talk about is toast.” She looks down at her mug, then back up at the other person. The man in the black shirt bends down to look at a toaster on the kitchen counter. The toaster is white with silver metal on top. The heating elements inside the toaster glow orange. The woman continues, “Being my favorite week, I thought intimacy week on this experiment would be so different, but like, it’s so awkward.” The man opens a cupboard and takes out a jar of peanut butter. The woman continues, “We’re just talking about toast and butter and bread.” The man puts two pieces of bread into the toaster. He then spreads peanut butter onto the toasted bread. The woman continues, “Josh said that he wanted to get to know me. He knows that I lack sourdough. So maybe these little small little things is his way of coming in.” The man sits down at a round table and drinks from a carton of chocolate milk. The woman sits on a couch with a blanket draped over her legs and drinks from her mug. She says, “I feel like all I can do is keep showing up and I need to meet him halfway.” The man eats his toast. The woman continues, “I will take Alessandra’s advice and I’m just going to communicate with him. I’m hopeful. I’m hopeful that uh, today will be a good day. Yeah.” The man drinks more chocolate milk. The woman holds her empty mug and laughs. She stands up and walks over to the man, still holding her mug. She says, “See? You’re right.” She laughs and walks away. The camera shows a building with the name “SKYE” on it. The camera then shows a door with a silver handle and a keyhole. A woman with dark hair is sitting on a balcony, looking out at the view. The narrator says, “Down the hall, Bronte is feeling blindsided by Harrison’s decision to write ‘leave’ at the commitment ceremony.” The scene changes to a commitment ceremony. A man and a woman are sitting on a couch. The man is wearing a blue shirt and white pants. The woman is wearing a green strapless dress. The man says, “Uh, we’ve been living apart for so long now. And for me, that’s not a relationship. So I wrote ‘leave’.” The woman looks surprised. She says, “I’m confused that he wrote ‘leave’. He texted me before commitment ceremony and goes, ‘I’m not going anywhere.’ But he wrote ‘leave’. When times get tough, he literally chose to leave. He didn’t even give me time to process what had happened. It was like everything I wanted now, now, now.” The scene changes to Bronte sitting on a balcony, looking out at the view and holding a small cup. She says, “I don’t know what Harrison is truly wanting.” The scene changes to a man wearing a white t-shirt and black shorts, walking through an apartment. He’s wearing a red baseball cap. He opens a sliding glass door and walks onto the balcony. A woman is sitting in a chair on the balcony, wearing sunglasses and a white crop top. The man sits down in a chair next to her. The woman says, “There’s so much going through my mind. Like, of all honesty, like, I should have wrote ‘leave’.” The man says, “You’re right.” The woman continues, “We’re just on two completely different spectrums of human being. I don’t think you are used to dealing with someone like me who is sensitive and who…” The man interrupts her and says, “You’re right.” The woman continues, “I have the exact same questions going around in my head. I sat there last night and wanted to leave.” The man says, “Exactly. But what blows my mind, Harrison, is that you literally texted me and you literally said, ‘I’m not leaving.’ Yet you wrote ‘leave’. You threw in the towel because I’m not giving you enough when…” The man interrupts her and says, “When did I write I’m not leaving? Show me where I wrote I’m not leaving.” The woman looks at her phone and says, “I’m not going anywhere.” The man says, “Yeah. Literally what you said to me.” The woman says, “But you’re, you’re just said the words, ‘I’m not leaving’.” The woman continues, “You literally, I’m not leaving and I’m not going anywhere. I told you that’s irrelevant.” The man says, “You’re trying…” The woman interrupts him and says, “You’re gaslighting me.” The man says, “You’re saying that I said something I didn’t say.” The woman says, “No, I didn’t. When did I say that you lied? You literally put words in my mouth, Harrison. When did I say that you lied about the message? No, I didn’t. When did I say that you lied? You literally said, ‘I’m not going anywhere’.” The man says, “That’s where you’re actually doing it. No, you literally said, ‘I’m not going anywhere’.” The woman says, “Where are you going to go if you were saying ‘leave’ or ‘I’m not going anywhere’? Honestly. You say that you’re, I’m gaslighting you. You’re literally sitting here gaslighting me. You put words in my mouth. You literally said you’re gaslighting me.” The man says, “No.” The woman continues, “You’re a narcissist, Harrison.” The woman stands up and walks away. She says, “Hey, thanks for today. It was really nice for us to talk without an argument. Thanks for sharing. All you did, I’m not going anywhere.” The man says, “Where does it say I’m not leaving? You’re trying…” The woman interrupts him and says, “I’m not going anywhere and I’m not leaving.” The man says, “It’s totally different because you’re trying to twist that into me saying that I lied about the message.” The woman says, “No, I’m not. No, I’m not. No, I didn’t. When did I say that you lied?” The man says, “That’s what you’re actually doing.” The woman says, “No, you literally said, ‘I’m not going anywhere’.” The man says, “Yes.” The woman says, “That’s right. Where are you going to go if you were saying ‘leave’ or ‘I’m not going anywhere’? Honestly. You say that you’re, I’m gaslighting you. You’re literally sitting here gaslighting me. You put words in my mouth.” The woman storms off. The man says, “You’re bathing in Windex, mate. I literally see right through you.” The “Married at First Sight” logo appears on screen.

A black-and-white photograph of a young Tina Turner with her basketball team is displayed. The narrator states that Tina Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock in 1939. As a young girl living in Tennessee, she picked cotton. Her mother was a survivor of domestic violence. At 11, she was taken in by her grandmother in Nutbush, a rural community which she later made famous in song.\\n\\n**[00:00:21]** Black-and-white footage of a young Tina Turner performing with Ike Turner and their band is shown. The narrator explains that in 1957, Anna Mae met Ike Turner, and their partnership changed her life. She found success through the Ike and Tina Turner Revue. They married and had children, but a dark fact was hidden from the public: Ike was an abuser. Tina Turner, in a later interview, describes the abuse and violence she endured, stating that she eventually felt life wasn't worth living if she stayed in that situation.\\n\\n**[00:00:58]** After 16 years, she left Ike. The next chapter saw her head down under. Footage of Tina Turner performing in Australia is shown. She is asked if she minds doing \\\"that Nutbush thing.\\\" She replies that she still has fun, especially in Australia, because the kids made a dance for her. \\n\\n**[00:01:14]** Tina found big-screen stardom, filming Mad Max in Coober Pedy with Mel Gibson. Then, she was beamed into homes, energizing footy fans with \\\"Simply the Best,\\\" which was used in an Australian Rugby League ad campaign. Her Australian manager, Roger Davies, is credited with her extraordinary comeback. Tina Turner says that Roger is the brother she never had. Today, he stated he will miss her deeply. For all of Tina's success, she never stopped searching for something. In an interview, she says she really needed love. She found it with Erwin Bach, a German actor and music producer, who would give her his kidney when she became sick.\\n\\n**[00:02:01]** In an interview, Tina Turner is asked if there's anything she wants in life that she doesn't have. She replies, \\\"No, I have everything.\\\" This was her final on-stage performance in 2009. She bowed out with 12 Grammys, a lifetime achievement award, record-breaking tours, and 180 million album sales. She stepped away from the spotlight, battling cancer, seeking a quieter life with her husband in Switzerland. Her life's story inspired a musical, hitting the West End and Broadway. She states that she can never be as happy as she is now.\\n\\n**[00:02:44]** In Hollywood, outside Capitol Records, the label that helped reignite her career, a star and flowers are placed as a memorial, offering fans a chance to mourn the loss and remember the life and music of Tina Turner. A fan interviewed says, \\\"She's simply the best.\\\" Last month, in one of her final interviews, a message on closure: \\\"Maybe that's the answer: to keep moving forward, to let go, and aim to fill your life with love. That is where I am now and I am grateful.\\\" Her voice will endure long beyond her passing.\\n\\n**[00:03:32]** The news segment transitions to sports, where they will look at Tina Turner's extraordinary contribution to Australian Rugby League and speak to the stars who took part in the iconic \\\"Simply the Best\\\" campaign.\\n\\n**[00:03:45]** The news segment shifts to a report on the death of 95-year-old Clare Nowland, who was tasered in her Cooma nursing home. Nine News reveals that police allege Senior Constable Kristian White said \\\"bugger it\\\" as he deployed his taser. Police allege Mrs. Nowland was holding a steak knife when the officer said \\\"stop\\\" several times and \\\"drop it.\\\" She raised the knife to chest height in his colleague's direction. Senior Constable White asked her to stop before deploying the taser, saying \\\"bugger it.\\\" His lawyer, Warwick Anderson, says he is very distressed and that there's no dispute about what happened. The 33-year-old is charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. The charges could be upgraded to manslaughter, but investigators will have to wait on the results of an autopsy to prove the tasering caused the injuries that led to Mrs. Nowland's death. News of the much-loved volunteer's death hit home. Locals express their sadness and shock, noting that the flag is at half-mast. One local says that even if you didn't know her, she was an important member of the community. Clare Nowland was a mother of eight, grandmother to 24, and great-grandmother to 31. Her son says that the thing that struck him most was her love of family and that she's left a wonderful legacy.\\n\\n**[00:05:53]** The news segment transitions to a report on rising electricity bills. From July 1, energy retailers will hike their rates. Mortgage, rent, grocery prices, and now your electricity bill is on the rise. Standing offers in New South Wales and Queensland will rise from July 1. Household bills in New South Wales are up on average over $480 for the year, and Queensland prices are expected to rise by $400. Small businesses will see jumps of at least 15%. The Energy Minister, Chris Bowen, acknowledges the big increases but states that without the intervention of the Albanese government, they would have been much bigger. The Prime Minister explicitly and repeatedly promised to deliver cheaper electricity. The Deputy Opposition Leader, Susan Ley, accuses the Prime Minister of breaking his promise and lying to the Australian people. The Prime Minister responds that they provided $1.6 billion in the budget for energy efficiency upgrades. Those include induction cooktops, household batteries, electric hot water, and insulation available to subsidized homes. Energy providers are required to offer assistance to Australians who can't afford their bills. The government may have to offer a little more assistance in the future.\\n\\n**[00:07:45]** A 64-year-old man has been charged over a spate of alleged sexual touching incidents in Sydney spanning two decades. He is accused of inappropriately touching four women. The first reported incident was in 2002. He was arrested on Elizabeth Street at Liverpool this morning.\\n\\n**[00:08:03]** A pitch invader has pleaded guilty to assaulting Dragons player Zac Lomax during the Anzac Day NRL match against the Roosters. 19-year-old Curtis Quealy has already been banned from New South Wales stadiums for two years, and next month, he will learn his punishment in court.\\n\\n**[00:08:24]** Melissa Caddick's disappearance may forever remain a mystery. An inquest was unable to determine how the fraudster died. There were chaotic scenes outside court today after her husband, Anthony Koletti, was slammed by a coroner. His account was riddled with inconsistencies, sparking suspicion that he's hiding something. The inquest asked if Anthony Koletti knew more than he was letting on. Married to the country's biggest con woman and now suspected of a cover-up, he is clearly not happy about the accusations. The coroner found he had some awareness of Ms. Caddick's movements but chose not to disclose it. Melissa Caddick vanished the morning after ASIC raided her Dover Heights home in 2020. The 49-year-old wasn't reported missing for 30 hours. Police were initially suspicious of her husband. He tells police that this is the full story. But the theories changed as a $20 million Ponzi scheme was unraveled. Was Caddick hiding, murdered, or did she take her own life? Then, the conspiracy: the mother amputated her own limb after her shoe and foot washed up on the south coast. The inquest put an end to any speculation that the fraudster could still be living among us. It is possible Melissa Caddick jumped from the cliffs at Dover Heights, but the coroner found there's not enough evidence to prove it. \"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09401007,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.120025486},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.15817478,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20946948},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.21206883,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.150029},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1847675,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.20689407}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":2253,"promptTokenCount":799722,"totalTokenCount":801975}}}

The green and white crane is lifting a small, square container. The scene then shifts to a construction site, where two workers in high-visibility vests are standing near a blue and white Kenworth truck with \\\"OVER SIZE\\\" written on the front. A small dog is also present. The scene then transitions to a sign for the Victorian Building Authority (VBA). Next, the video shows construction workers on scaffolding at a building site. The scene then changes to an interview setting, where a woman with blonde hair and a black sleeveless top is speaking to someone off-screen. She appears to be distressed and wipes away tears. The interviewer, a woman with short blonde hair and a pink shirt, asks her a question. The woman in black responds, expressing her belief that her husband, a building inspector, was pressured into cutting corners on the job and that the VBA didn't care about the quality of work. She says that all inspectors were pressured not to do their jobs properly. The scene then shifts to the woman in black listening to an audio recording on her phone while wearing headphones. The audio is of a man's voice, presumably her husband, talking about feeling pressured at work. The scene then changes back to the interview setting, with the two women sitting at a table covered in papers and photographs. The interviewer says that the papers are Rob's correspondence with the VBA. She mentions that Rob documented every detail of his work to protect himself, believing he was a target. He feared he would be managed out of a job. The woman in black says he was trying to fight to do his job, and it was heartbreaking that he couldn't do what he was employed to do. She says she told him to leave, but he said he couldn't because a lot of people relied on him. The scene then shifts to a photo of a man in a red jacket, with an audio recording of him talking about unrealistic expectations at work. The scene then returns to the two women at the table. The interviewer says that Rob was a member of the union and told them about his struggles in many emails. The woman in black adds that the union was so concerned that it informed the VBA managers, raising their fears that someone would end up taking their own life. The scene then changes to a woman sitting on a bench by the water, looking out at a field of wooden posts. She stands up and walks towards the posts, her image becoming blurry. The woman is then seen in a close-up shot, her face showing sadness. She says she was devastated when her husband took his own life, as he had no mental health issues in the past other than what he had from work. She believes the VBA caused his death. She says she had so much anger because it was only work to her, but to him, it was important. The scene then changes to a man walking down a dark street at night. The camera focuses on his legs and then on his back as he walks. The scene then transitions to a close-up of a man's eye behind glasses. The interviewer asks him to describe the culture of the VBA. He responds with one word: \\\"toxic.\\\" The interviewer then asks what kind of pressure was on inspectors in terms of numbers. The man explains that there was enormous pressure to put KPIs on inspections, which is ridiculous because one permit might be for 30 duplex units and another permit might be for a small two-bedroom unit, but it's still only one inspection. The interviewer asks why someone like him didn't just do that and achieve high numbers without worrying about the quality. He replies that he doesn't think it's in some people's DNA to do that. The scene then changes to a sign for The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne. The interviewer, now wearing a blue suit, stands in front of the hospital and says that inspectors were encouraged to cut corners, often not even visiting building sites, instead relying on FaceTime videos to get the job done faster, a potential breach of the Building Act. She then says that what happened at the Royal Children's Hospital was even worse. The VBA sent inspectors there to inspect the plumbing on medical gases, but an investigation found they weren't even qualified to do the job. The man's eye behind glasses is shown again. He says that people of this organization don't have the same moral fiber or social conscience that he has. The interviewer, now wearing a blue dress, asks him if there is any doubt as to why Rob took his own life. He says no, none whatsoever. He was harassed. The interviewer, now wearing a red suit, asks Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, if his government was alerted to the fact that there were serious workplace problems within the VBA in February 2022. Andrews says he certainly wasn't. The interviewer clarifies that she is asking whether the government knew about the workplace problems within the VBA and what action they took before the tragedy. Andrews says he certainly didn't. The interviewer says she hopes the premier will have more luck getting answers out of the VBA than she did, as they refused her request for an interview. She adds that there are, however, multiple investigations underway looking into their practices. The scene then changes to a beach, where two women are walking. The interviewer, now wearing a pink shirt, asks the woman in black what she thinks Rob would want to be done. She replies that he would definitely want them to be held accountable. She adds that she is still concerned about people's safety there and that she will keep fighting. The video ends with a photo of a couple, presumably Rob and the woman in black, smiling at the camera. The 60 Minutes logo and contact information are displayed, along with the Lifeline phone number. The host, Amelia Adams, signs off and the 60 Minutes logo and production information are shown again.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.18952143,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1968261},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1801067,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.26133114},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.2436427,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.18242536},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.13753287,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17441037}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1811,"promptTokenCount":823028,"totalTokenCount":824839}}}

She appears to be in a dimly lit room, possibly a studio, and looks down and to the side with a sad expression. The scene then transitions to a stage performance with red lighting and smoke. People in costumes are on stage, some holding a large wooden cross. The scene appears to depict a dramatic or religious performance. The audio describes the use of demons and Satan by the Potter's House Church to instill fear and control. The scene changes again, showing a man being dragged by a chain by a figure in a black hooded costume with a red demon mask. The lighting is now a mix of pink and purple. The scene transitions to a close-up of the masked figure, now in the audience, still dragging the man. The scene then shifts to a close-up of a person's face with their eyes taped shut. The lighting is dark, with a purplish hue. The scene changes to an image of a volcano erupting, followed by a close-up of a person's face with their eyes open, seemingly in distress. The scene then transitions to two women sitting on a white couch in a brightly lit room. One woman has long dark hair and is wearing a pink sweater, while the other has shoulder-length blonde hair and is wearing a white blouse. A laptop sits on a small white table in front of them. The women are having a conversation about movies shown by the Potter's House Church. The dark-haired woman explains that the movies were shown to scare them and reinforce the teachings of the church. She says that they were meant to instill fear of what would happen if they didn't follow the church's lifestyle. The scene transitions to a sunset over the ocean, followed by a close-up of the dark-haired woman on a beach at sunset. The audio identifies her as Amy Higginson, who was born into the Potter's House. A clip from an old movie is shown on the laptop, depicting a man in a military helmet being asked to renounce his faith. The scene then shows a young girl being forced into a guillotine-like device. The women on the couch continue to discuss the movies, with Amy expressing that the movies still terrify her. The scene returns to the beach, showing Amy walking along the shore. The audio describes Amy's constant fear of demons growing inside her if she did something wrong. Amy explains that her father used the term \\\"manifesting\\\" to describe the demons. The scene shifts back to the two women on the couch. The blonde-haired woman asks Amy what was considered bad behavior. Amy replies that even simple things like listening to non-Christian music or reading non-Christian books were considered bad. The scene transitions to Amy sitting on the beach at sunset. The audio mentions that both Amy and Katrina left the church as young adults and were not shocked to hear about the link between the extreme sect and the tragedy on the Melbourne Freeway in 2020. The scene changes to a group of people in suits walking down a city street. The audio explains that they understand why the trucking boss, Simon Tuterru, thought prayer would fix the drug-addicted truck driver's problems. The scene then shifts to a close-up of a man's hand holding a white cap. The man has a white beard and is wearing a dark shirt. The scene changes to a close-up of the man's hand, held up as if in prayer. The scene transitions to the woman with long brown hair from the beginning of the video. She says that when she heard the news, she knew it was based on what the church does. Amy adds that the fact that Tuterru believed in voodoo and didn't see it as a reason to seek help didn't surprise her. She says that he believed what he was doing was right. The blonde-haired woman says that instead of telling him to get help, he prayed with him and cast a spell. Amy agrees, saying that for the Potter's House, that's normal and something they genuinely believe. She adds that anyone else would have known how to respond in that situation. The scene changes to a bald man looking out a window with textured glass. The blonde-haired woman asks him if he feels any remorse or guilt when he hears these stories. The man, now sitting in a chair, says that he absolutely does and that in the first couple of years after leaving the Potter's House, he apologized to every ex-member he saw. He says he wasn't apologizing for the extreme acts mentioned, but he recognized he was part of it. He adds that he'd been there since he was 19 and grew up in it, so he didn't see the errors and extremes. The blonde-haired woman asks him what his message is for pastors in the Potter's House now. The man suggests that they rejoin the mainstream Christian church and allow outside voices to bring them back before anything serious happens. The scene transitions to a group of people on a stage, throwing money in the air. The audio mentions that when Potter's House senior member Simon Tuterru chose to pray for his exhausted truck driver and advised him to get back behind the wheel, four police officers lost their lives. The scene changes to photos of four police officers. The audio states that three months after the tragedy, Victoria Police charged Tuterru with four counts of manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty, and a trial date was set. However, in October last year, the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions dropped all charges. The scene transitions to a man in a suit walking away from a parking lot. The audio mentions that Tuterru is no longer a pastor but is still a senior member of the church. When contacted, he refused to comment on what happened. The scene changes to a close-up of a chain-link fence, then to a building with a sign that reads \\\"Welcome to the Potter's House Church (Please proceed upstairs).\\\" The scene then shows a wrecked police car next to a truck labeled \\\"CONNECT LOGISTICS.\\\" The scene transitions to a man with long white hair and a beard. He says that he feels frustrated and angry that Tuterru hasn't faced court for anything. He adds that there are three levels of blame: the driver of the truck, Tuterru (who was the manager), and the Potter's House, which influenced Tuterru's decision to send the driver back on the road. He says that justice means everyone who had a role should be held accountable. He adds that Kevin, Josh, Glenn, Lynette, and their families need closure and justice. The scene transitions to a photo album, showing pictures of a woman with red hair and glasses. The audio mentions that the man is calling for an inquiry into the church to prevent similar accidents. The scene shifts to a banner on a fence that reads \\\"COME AND RECEIVE A MIRACLE. HOPE, JOY, PEACE, HEALING, LIFE, A NEW FUTURE.\\\" The scene then shows the wrecked police car and truck again. The scene transitions to a woman in a red suit sitting on a stool in front of a red curtain. A poster behind her shows a shirtless man with tape over his mouth and the words \\\"WHO'S HUGH?\\\" The woman says that Hugh Sheridan is one of the nicest people you could ever meet, both on screen and in the theater, and one of Australia's finest and most loved actors. She asks how anyone could make sense of what happened in 2020, when Sheridan became the target of a vile hate campaign that almost broke him. The video ends with a close-up of the man with the long white hair and beard. He says that there are three levels of blame: the driver, Tuterru, and the Potter's House. The video then shows a clock with the words \\\"60 MINUTES\\\" on it, followed by a series of clips promoting upcoming segments on the show.\n    \",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Studio\",\n      \"Stage performance\",\n      \"Audience\",\n      \"Volcano eruption\",\n      \"Living room with white couch\",\n      \"Beach at sunset\",\n      \"City street\",\n      \"Window with textured glass\",\n      \"Potter's House Church\",\n      \"Melbourne Freeway crash site\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Religious extremism\",\n      \"Cult-like behavior\",\n      \"Fear and control\",\n      \"Tragedy and accountability\",\n      \"Justice and closure\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Katrina\",\n      \"Amy Higginson\",\n      \"Simon Tuterru\",\n      \"David Vickery\",\n      \"Kevin\",\n      \"Josh\",\n      \"Glenn\",\n      \"Lynette\",\n      \"Hugh Sheridan\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.24220619,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.22953552},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.26740846,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.28140607},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.39001182,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.3040417},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.17328803,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.26284194}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1940,"promptTokenCount":843088,"totalTokenCount":845028}}}

They kiss. Sandy says that knowing that Claire kissed Adam is not a good feeling. She says that she keeps looking over at Claire and Jesse, and they seem to be okay.

She says that she feels like she’s very much steering the ship with the conversation. Rupert asks why she would say that. Evelyn says that she doesn’t think so. She says that this is where she steers the conversation and asks him a question. She asks him what his pick-up line would be if he saw her in a bar. Rupert says that he’d just say, “You owe me an espresso.” Evelyn asks if that’s his pick-up line. Rupert says that it’s different. Evelyn says that if he went up to her in a bar and said, “You owe me an espresso,” she’d be like, “What?” Rupert says that he’d just get her talking. Evelyn says that he needs to give her something. She says that he needs to show her that he even thinks she’s hot, and show her that he wants to be there. She says that he needs to give her something, anything. Rupert asks, “Shall we?” Evelyn asks, “Shall we?” Rupert asks, “Shall we leave?” Evelyn says, “Okay, I guess.” Rupert says, “My first move.” Evelyn laughs.

The camera moves to show a partially constructed house behind a chain-link fence. Two signs on the fence read \\\"DANGER DEEP EXCAVATION\\\" and \\\"DANGER CONSTRUCTION SITE UNAUTHORISED PERSONS KEEP OUT.\\\" The camera then focuses on the entrance of the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) building, showing the sliding glass doors and the VBA logo.\n\n\nA woman named Ann is interviewed. She explains that she was held legally responsible for a construction mess on her property. She sought help from the VBA but received no assistance despite providing evidence, including photos. She questions the VBA's purpose and criticizes the use of taxpayer money to employ people who seemingly do nothing. She expresses her frustration and questions whether the VBA should even exist.\n\n\nThe reporter then states that Ann lodged 14 complaints with the VBA over three years, but they were stonewalled. The VBA considers the case closed, but Ann is financially and emotionally devastated, having lost her life savings.\n\n\nThe camera shows a woman standing at a window, her back to the camera. The reporter then interviews a man who compares buying a house with buying a car. He argues that if something goes wrong with a car, the dealer fixes it immediately. However, with a house, you can spend a significant amount of money and face endless problems with no easy solution.\n\n\nThe segment shifts to Tamara Ralton, whose house looks complete from the outside. However, the first attempt at building her home was a disaster, requiring demolition and rebuilding by a new builder. This left Tamara financially crippled. She recalls signing the sale contract, believing she was achieving the Australian dream of owning a home.\n\n\nSix weeks after a photo of Tamara and her partner was taken, her apartment flooded due to a hole in the roof where the drainpipe should have been. This was just the beginning of numerous defects. The builder, Shangri-La Constructions, refused to fix the issues and told Tamara to take them to court. She was prepared for a fight but didn't anticipate the enormous financial cost.\n\n\nThe most dangerous defects were water damage, leading to toxic black mold, and flammable cladding, which made the building one of the most dangerous in the state. Tamara's daughter was diagnosed with asthma as a direct result of the mold. Tamara expresses her heartbreak as a mother. The decision to demolish and rebuild the apartment was made in late 2020. Tamara had to pay for alternative accommodation and a $2.1 million strata loan, costing $200,000 a year in interest.\n\n\nTamara and the other owners refused to give up. They paid for independent reports to prove the extent of the damage to the VBA. The reports included assessments of water damage, mold, structural issues, fire risks, and building defects. The VBA had all these reports but failed to act effectively. Tamara questions why Shangri-La was still operating.\n\n\nThe VBA admitted to losing all but one of the reports, an astonishing admission of incompetence. Shangri-La received a small fine and a three-month suspension, which was overturned on appeal. The company later went into liquidation, but some family members continued building under a different name, SLC Bayside. The reporter expresses surprise that more consumers haven't been driven to the brink.\n\n\nThe segment then introduces Rob Karkut, a VBA inspector who took his own life 12 months prior. His widow, Andrea Holden, describes the stress he experienced due to the unrealistic and unfair demands of his job. Rob loved his job and was dedicated to it. He often spoke about the pressures he faced at the VBA, particularly the KPI targets for inspections. He was overwhelmed by the way he was treated and the impossible position of not being able to do his job properly.\n\n\nThe inspectors were pressured to complete around 60 inspections a month, regardless of the faults they found. This pressure followed a 2020 Victorian government order for the VBA to increase inspections of new buildings.\n\n\nThe reporter questions Premier Daniel Andrews about whether the VBA is doing its job. Andrews avoids directly answering the question. The reporter then asks if the Victorian Building Authority is broken. Andrews again avoids a direct answer. The segment ends with Andrea Holden expressing her belief that the VBA's treatment of Rob was unforgivable and unfair. She recalls a conversation where Rob told a motel owner about a bathroom problem. The owner dismissed Rob's concerns, telling him he was on holidays and didn't need to do inspections. Andrea describes Rob as having a big personality and being full of life. She emphasizes that he loved his job and didn't want to be anything else. She expresses her pain and disbelief at the situation that led to his suicide.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.19314747,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17328803},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.20181336,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.273575},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.26133114,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16132025},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.09268759,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16344576}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1269,"promptTokenCount":823028,"totalTokenCount":824297}}}

The woman is talking to another woman, who is sitting across from her. The second woman has long dark hair and is wearing a red shirt. She is looking at the first woman with concern. The second woman says, \\\"The fact that she's come forward and said something just goes to show her moral compass. She needs to come clean, and she is.\\\" The camera then cuts to the two women sitting at a glass table, having a conversation. The woman in the red shirt says, \\\"I don't even know how he's going to take it.\\\" The camera then cuts to a man with long dark hair and tattoos on his chest and arms. He is standing in front of a mirror, running his hands through his wet hair. The camera cuts back to the two women at the table. The woman in the red shirt says, \\\"Yeah, I know you can't fix it, but like, you've just got to remember that you're a good person who makes mistakes. You want to tell Jesse? That's a great start.

Step one.\\\" The camera cuts back to the man with tattoos, who is now looking at himself in the mirror with a concerned expression. The woman with glasses says, \\\"If Jesse got so upset that thinking that we may have been on the phone, I can't imagine like how he's going to react to this.\\\" The camera cuts to the title card for the show \\\"Married at First Sight.\\\" The camera then shows a series of shots of Sydney, Australia, including the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the city skyline. A voiceover says, \\\"It's been four weeks since the couples joined the experiment. And at this halfway mark, the experts are ready to reveal two more matches.\\\" The camera cuts to a man and a woman sitting on a couch. The man is wearing a black shirt and has tattoos on his arms. The woman has long blonde hair and is wearing a light brown sweatshirt. She is holding a letter and smiling. The man says, \\\"We got a letter!\\\" The woman says, \\\"Yay!\\\" The camera cuts to a man walking down a hallway, opening a door. He is wearing a light green shirt and khaki shorts. He is holding a letter and smiling. The camera cuts back to the man and woman on the couch. The woman is reading the letter.

A voiceover says, \\\"While things aren't looking good for Claire's marriage, two new couples are about to begin their journey.\\\" The camera cuts to a shot of a rural landscape in Tasmania. A woman with long blonde hair is walking through a field with two white dogs. She says, \\\"I'm Tayla, I'm 27 and I'm a nurse.\\\" The camera cuts to Tayla in a bathroom, putting on her stethoscope. She says, \\\"I love it. Something that I always wanted to do. I think I'm good at my job because I am very direct and very honest. I do have a very caring side to me as well and I think that comes into play with all of my patients.\\\" The camera cuts to Tayla curling her hair. She says, \\\"Despite Tayla's nurturing occupation, she's turned to the experts to help her overcome a major flaw in the approach she takes to her love life.\\\" The camera cuts to Tayla applying blush. She says, \\\"I would definitely say that it is Tayla's way or the highway. I cannot negotiate on the littlest of things. I'm not happy if I don't get my way. I don't compromise.\\\" The camera cuts to Tayla applying mascara. A producer asks, \\\"Do you like that you're this way?\\\" Tayla says, \\\"It's a problem for me. I cannot negotiate with even the smallest of things. So yeah, it's hard. I definitely want to change that, otherwise I'm going to be lonely for the rest of my life.\\\" The camera cuts to Tayla in a video call with a man. The man asks, \\\"Why do you think it no longer works for you in relationships?\\\" Tayla says, \\\"Well, I think because it gets to the point where I have broken someone and they lose their power and I think I really take away everything that they have to offer and I think that's really awful. I hate that and I don't want to be like that.\\\" The man says, \\\"So, obviously then, one of the biggest challenges is going to be in this experiment, you letting go, 'cause it's really not an experiment for control freaks because you have no control.\\\" Tayla says, \\\"Yeah, that will be a massive struggle for me.\\\" The camera cuts to Tayla walking through a field. She says, \\\"I want to do Married at First Sight because I definitely want the help of the experts. My behaviors are holding me back for the future that I want for myself because I want, you know, to get married and have children. I want a nice guy.\\\" The camera cuts to a man in a suit walking down a city street. He says, \\\"I need a nice guy.\\\" The camera cuts to the man sitting in a chair. A producer asks, \\\"How attractive do you think you are?\\\" The man says, \\\"Hopefully a seven in the right light with heels on.\\\" He laughs. The man says, \\\"I'm Hugo, I'm 32 and I'm an account executive. And I've been described by some friends as having big Labrador energy. I would say my approach to life is I try not to take myself too seriously. I like to see myself like a lovable space cadet.\\\" The camera cuts to Hugo sitting on a dock, looking out at the water. He says, \\\"I grew up in Sydney. I was raised by a single mum with an older brother. I lost my father at an early age at five years old to a brain tumor. It's something that I try not to think about because it is quite difficult.\\\" The camera shows photos of Hugo with his father. Hugo says, \\\"My mum is a wonderful woman. She's very strong. She had to be, she raised two boys by herself. I will always love her to death for that. So when it comes to my dating life, I definitely gravitate towards women with a strong personality. There's nothing sexier than a woman who knows what she wants.\\\" The camera cuts to Hugo walking through a field with two white dogs. He says, \\\"What I want is to be married. I would love to be with someone who wants to have children. I love my family to bits. Family's really important to me. And that's what I kind of look for in another person. To me, that's why being in love and finding somebody that's your ride or die is so important.\\\" The camera cuts to three people sitting in chairs, having a conversation. A woman says, \\\"Tayla has shared with us that she loves to be in control in relationships. That's her default in a relationship. And these unrelenting standards have led to her dating the wrong men time and time again.\\\" Another woman says, \\\"Tayla will be challenging to get close to. Hugo is quite calm, but he's also someone who's prepared to speak his mind. So I think that combination can actually allow her to let down some of those unrelenting standards and essentially be a little bit more open to doing things differently. And she said to us she's ready to change.\\\" A man says, \\\"That's right, and I think Hugo can be that change for her.\\\" The camera shows photos of Tayla and Hugo. A voiceover says, \\\"The first new couple have been revealed. The experts will challenge Tayla to let go of control and find the love that she seeks with nice guy Hugo.\\\" The camera shows a shot of the Sydney skyline at night. A voiceover says, \\\"But for the next couple entering the experiment, the experts believe polar opposites can have an instant attraction.\\\" The camera cuts to a woman getting her hair done. She says, \\\"Chin down.\\\" The woman says, \\\"I'm Evelyn, I'm 26. I'm a model and I live in Sydney. Yeah, that's good. It looks sweet now. I do fashion modelling and beauty. I think the modelling world is becoming so much more inclusive for like Eurasian short girls like me and I really love that.\\\" The camera cuts to Evelyn walking her dog in a park. A producer asks, \\\"Do you actually like dating?\\\" Evelyn says, \\\"People always assume that I'm super confident and I'm out all the time and there must be loads of guys after me, but to be honest, that's far from the truth. I don't know the last time you girls went out in Sydney, but it's rough out there. Like, it is it's terrible. I went on a date with a magician once. Didn't know he was a magician until I got I got there and he was like pulling out cards and dice. Did he have a rabbit? No. I might have stayed if he had a rabbit, to be honest. How many times do you think you've had your heart broken? I would say three times. I used to walk around with my heart on my sleeve. I stopped doing that now. Sorry. I've been cheated on a bunch of times. I want to believe love, it's like this beautiful thing that is that exists, but like in this day and age, it just sucks out there. I've very much lived my love life in fear. Going forward in this experiment, I'm choosing not to do that anymore.\\\" The camera cuts to Evelyn sleeping with her dog. She says, \\\"I'm going into this experiment completely vulnerable. I really want to meet someone special. Just hopefully makes me believe again.\\\" The camera cuts to a man in an orange and navy blue work shirt, standing on a ladder. He says, \\\"I am a bit of a romantic. I don't mind, you know, putting the effort in, you know, doing something nice for someone. I think I'm a bit of a lovable larrikin.\\\" The camera cuts to the man sitting in a chair. He says, \\\"I grew up in Sydney. I was raised by a single mum with an older brother. I lost my father at an early age at five years old to a brain tumor.

Then, the scene changes to a man in a suit standing in front of Buckingham Palace. He introduces himself as Tom Steinfort and welcomes viewers to \\\"60 Minutes\\\" and to London. He mentions that King Charles III has officially been crowned and now faces the challenge of filling his mother's shoes. He states that polling shows Queen Elizabeth was more popular than Charles, as are his son William, sister Anne, and even his grandchildren. He adds that the challenge extends beyond the UK, citing Australia as an example where the idea of a republic is gaining traction. He says that those close to the King want the world to know why he and Queen Camilla will succeed. \\n\\nThe scene shifts to footage of King Charles III and Queen Camilla on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, waving to the crowd. A child in the crowd takes a picture of them with a phone. The scene changes to a wider shot of the balcony, showing the royal family, including Prince William, Princess Kate, and their children. The narrator mentions that the traditional flyover had to be scaled back due to the weather. Prince Louis's wave is described as resembling windscreen wipers. The scene changes to a crowd of people waving British flags and wearing King Charles masks. The narrator mentions that King Charles would have been pleased with the turnout of his loyal subjects. \\n\\nThe scene changes to an interview with Valentine Low, the royal correspondent for The Times newspaper. He describes being inside Westminster Abbey and witnessing every moment of the coronation up close. He mentions the basis of the coronation ceremony goes back over a thousand years and the feeling of being part of history. He describes the King's robes as stupendous and the music as fantastic. He also notes the opulence of the crowns. \\n\\nThe scene cuts back to footage of the coronation ceremony, showing King Charles being crowned and receiving the Sovereign's Orb. The narrator mentions that the service was steeped in tradition but also acknowledged the changing face of modern Britain, as evidenced by the inclusion of a gospel choir. \\n\\nThe scene changes to Prince William and Princess Kate arriving at the Abbey with their three children. Prince George is described as watching his own future play out before him. Kate and Charlotte are described as radiant in matching Alexander McQueen gowns. The scene cuts back to the coronation ceremony, showing Prince William pledging allegiance to his father and sealing it with a kiss. The narrator mentions that this was one of the most iconic and heartfelt moments of the day. \\n\\nThe scene changes to footage of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, with a young Charles in attendance. The narrator notes the contrast in age between Charles at his mother's coronation and his own. He mentions that Prince Louis's yawns and waves caused a sensation for royal watchers. The scene changes to Prince Harry arriving at the coronation alone, without his wife Meghan and their children. The narrator mentions that Harry left the Abbey in a BMW straight to the airport. He is described as being relegated to the third row and his view sometimes obstructed by a feather. \\n\\nThe scene changes to Prince Andrew leaving the Abbey. The narrator mentions that Andrew was barred from the balcony display and frozen out of the family following his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. He adds that Andrew watched his brother become King and Camilla crowned Queen from the far edge of the third row. The narrator speculates on what Andrew might be thinking, suggesting he might be delusional about the situation blowing over and him having a role to play. \\n\\nThe scene changes to Madeleine Easton, the only Australian asked to perform at the coronation. She describes the experience as unbelievable and staggering. The narrator mentions that Madeleine is a member of the Baroque Soloists and Monteverdi Choir, of which King Charles is not just the patron but also a huge fan. He adds that she is on speed dial. The video ends with Madeleine playing the violin.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Buckingham Palace, London\",\n      \"Westminster Abbey, London\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Coronation of King Charles III\",\n      \"Royal family dynamics\",\n      \"Public opinion of the monarchy\",\n      \"Historical significance of the coronation\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Tom Steinfort\",\n      \"King Charles III\",\n      \"Queen Camilla\",\n      \"Queen Elizabeth II\",\n      \"Prince William\",\n      \"Princess Kate\",\n      \"Prince Louis\",\n      \"Prince George\",\n      \"Princess Charlotte\",\n      \"Valentine Low\",\n      \"Prince Harry\",\n      \"Meghan Markle\",\n      \"Prince Andrew\",\n      \"Jeffrey Epstein\",\n      \"Madeleine Easton\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.05582326,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.15203233},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.049588963,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.120025486},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.117572024,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16885665},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.06954183,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1623801}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1049,"promptTokenCount":823024,"totalTokenCount":824073}}}

The camera then pans up to show the man walking away from the camera on a city street. The narrator explains that the man, Chris Ridgeway, profited from a questionable global financial scheme to the tune of $1.6 million, while his clients lost millions. Ridgeway claims he doesn't know what happened to the money, but suggests that others might. \\n\\nThe scene changes to a parking garage, where an older man is seen walking and carrying a bag. The audio continues with Ridgeway saying that David Sutton would know where the money went. The scene then cuts to Ridgeway in a checkered shirt, suggesting that the interviewer ask David Sutton where the money is. The scene cuts to a woman in a red jacket, who is presumably the interviewer, listening intently.\\n\\nAn aerial shot shows a large house with a swimming pool, surrounded by trees. The narrator states that David Sutton lives in a wealthy suburb on Sydney's Northern Beaches. The scene cuts to the interviewer walking up to a house and knocking on the door. She identifies herself as Adele Ferguson from 60 Minutes. She then calls Sutton's phone, which goes to voicemail. A text message from Sutton appears on the screen, saying, \\\"Adele my legal advice is not to speak to the media.\\\" \\n\\nThe scene cuts to a woman knocking on a white door of a brick house. The narrator explains that they also tried to ask Sutton's business partner in England, Andy Turner, if he knew what happened to the money, but he wasn't talking either. A man answers the door and speaks on the phone. The narrator says that Turner later sent a statement denying any wrongdoing. \\n\\nRidgeway is seen walking in a park, carrying his jacket. He says that Turner and Sutton have left him out to dry and haven't helped him at all. The scene cuts to a group of people sitting around a large table in a formal room. They are discussing the financial scheme and how it was allowed to happen. They express frustration with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) for not protecting consumers. One person suggests that the directors involved in the scheme are likely planning their next company. Another person criticizes ASIC for being ineffective and says that it sends the wrong message to criminals when they don't act. \\n\\nA woman walks a dog in a park. Ridgeway is seen walking on a city sidewalk. The interviewer asks him what he thinks will happen. He says he may never be able to be a financial advisor again, or a company director, and that he may be charged with fraud and go to jail. He expresses fear and horror at the prospect. The interviewer asks him what he would say to his wife and children. He apologizes and says he didn't mean for this to happen. \\n\\nA woman with short blonde hair appears on screen, sitting in front of a graphic depicting a man surrounded by burning money. She summarizes the story, mentioning that Ridgeway's former employer, Shore and Partners, says he deliberately circumvented the company's compliance procedures. She also reports that ASIC has permanently banned Ridgeway from any involvement in financial services. \\n\\nThe segment transitions to a story about TikTok.

He states that his boss placed his hand on his head and prayed, \\\"In Jesus' name, take the curse away of the witch.\\\" After the prayer, his boss told him he could leave. The scene shifts to an aerial view of a highway where a truck crash has occurred. Emergency vehicles are on the scene. Next, photographs of four police officers who died in the crash are displayed. A man with a long white beard expresses remorse, stating that the truck driver should never have been on the road. A woman with blonde hair confirms that the driver shouldn't have been driving. The bearded man reiterates his statement. A bald man in a dark shirt with small gold dots speaks about people getting carried away with their authority, leading to tragic outcomes. A hand picks up a red Bible from a table. The bald man is seen again, now in a church, walking towards the altar. He is identified as David Vickery, the former head of the Potter's House Church in Australia. He spent three decades in the church before leaving with his family. He now understands how entrenched they were in the church's fundamental doctrine. He expresses disbelief at how anyone could lack basic common sense and understanding, and deviate so far from the basic tenets of Christian faith. A woman with blonde hair asks if it's brainwashing. Vickery explains that removing outside voices, keeping everyone within the church, and feeding them a specific narrative is a form of brainwashing. He is seen working on a laptop with a Bible open beside it. During his decade-long tenure as leader, David met Simon Tateru, pastor of a small Potter's House church in Melbourne. Vickery says he is not surprised by the truck driver's allegations about Tateru's interest in witchcraft. Tateru had pastored in Africa, witnessed witchcraft practices, embraced them, brought them back to Australia, and considered them a platform of truth. The blonde woman asks what Vickery knew about Tateru. Vickery describes him as warm, friendly, caring, quiet, and soft-natured. The woman notes that Tateru doesn't seem like someone who would deliberately cause harm, which Vickery confirms. A hand picks up a book titled \\\"Cults: Too Good To Be True\\\" from a stack of books. A man with a long white beard and a yarmulke, identified as Raphael Aron, director of Cult Consulting Australia, sits in a chair in a library and reads a book. He believes Tateru's religious brainwashing at the Potter's House played a significant role in his decision-making. Tateru is seen walking with a plastic container in his hand. Vickery says Tateru had embraced witchcraft in Africa, brought it back to Australia, and considered it a platform of truth. The blonde woman asks what Vickery knew about Tateru. Vickery describes him as warm, friendly, caring, quiet, and soft-natured. The woman notes that Tateru doesn't seem like someone who would deliberately cause harm, which Vickery confirms. Aron suggests that when critical thinking is turned off and individuals become completely subjected to an organization's ideology, anything can happen, especially if they believe it's God's message. Photographs of the four deceased police officers are displayed again. The narrator mentions that the Potter's House Church operated under the radar in Australia for over 40 years. There are now 72 churches across the country. Footage shows a church with a sign that reads \\\"Potter's House Christian Church Parramatta.\\\" Inside a church, a man in a suit prays for a man, placing his hand on his head. A young girl is also prayed for. The narrator says what goes on inside the church is astonishing and could be dangerous. In a suburban park outside Perth, Greg Mitchell, the world leader of the Potter's House Church, holds a miracle healing crusade. He prays for several people, placing his hand on their heads. For outsiders, it seems ludicrous, but for the indoctrinated, it's real. Mitchell claims witchcraft is at play. The truck driver, Mohinder Singh, is shown in court. The narrator mentions that Singh claims to have heard from his boss, Simon Tateru, a former Potter's House pastor, before the sleep-deprived Singh got in his truck and killed four police officers in a horrific crash. The bearded man says Singh was following his beliefs. The blonde woman confirms they were very firm beliefs. The bearded man says those beliefs overrode what Singh was supposed to be doing. He visits a memorial to the fallen officers. Footage shows a plaque with the name \\\"Lynette Rosemary Taylor.\\\" The bearded man, Stuart Schultz, is still grieving the loss of his wife, Lynette Taylor, in the truck crash. He recently learned about the link to the Potter's House Church and is furious that they're allowed to push their alarming doctrine. The blonde woman asks what Schultz sees as the danger when that ideology spreads into the community. He believes it's a serious threat to people's safety when such decisions affect others' lives, livelihoods, and work. Footage shows Mitchell praying for a man and a woman. The narrator mentions that the undercover footage reveals the church's extreme approach to illness. Mitchell prays for a woman with scoliosis, claiming she's been cursed. The former head of the Potter's House Church in Australia, David Vickery, agrees that the ideology is harmful and extreme. He criticizes the church's adamant stance on witchcraft and their lack of consultation with doctors. Footage shows Mitchell praying for a young girl with scoliosis. Watching the footage brings back painful memories for Katrina Turner, who grew up in the Potter's House. She cries and says it's hard to watch. She describes how they would pray loudly and speak in tongues, commanding the demon of lust out of her when she was only six years old. She believed she was bad and had a demon. The blonde woman notes that Mitchell is playing God. Turner says the church blames her for her scoliosis. The blonde woman says that's horrible. Footage shows Mitchell praying for a woman. The church's healing booklet attributes various medical conditions to spiritual causes. Colon cancer is attributed to an inherited curse, eczema to witchcraft, heart conditions to resentment, stroke to hatred and self-pity. The church believes prayer can heal all of these. Turner points out the booklet's claims about cervical and breast cancer being caused by gossip, promiscuity, and hatred of husbands. She finds it ridiculous that the church blames people for being sick or not praying enough. Footage shows Mitchell praying for a woman. Turner describes how they would put their hands on her and pray loudly, speaking in tongues, commanding the demon of lust out of her when she was only six years old. She believed she was bad and had a demon. The blonde woman notes that the church blames Turner for her scoliosis. The narrator mentions that the church blames various medical conditions on human behavior, curses, and witchcraft, and believes prayer can heal all of them. The church booklet is shown again, with various medical conditions and their supposed spiritual causes. Turner points out the church's claims about colon cancer, diabetes, and digestive disorders. She finds it ridiculous. She says it's like saying you're sick because you're not praying enough. Footage shows a sunset over a city skyline with two black swans in the water. Turner is seen walking along a path by the water. She says the constant praying was distressing and physically confronting.

The reporter discusses the Australian government's plans to introduce new regulations for these services, including credit licenses, responsible lending, dispute resolution and hardship options, and marketing and advertising restrictions. The reporter interviews Peter Gray, co-founder of Zip Co, who supports the proposed changes. The reporter then speaks with Fiona Guthrie from Financial Counselling Australia, who expresses concern about the potential harm caused by buy now, pay later services. \\n\\nThe next segment focuses on a world-first event: a Saudi Arabian woman, Rayyanah Barnawi, is rocketing towards the International Space Station on a private flight piloted by a woman, Peggy Whitson. The mission is historic on several levels. The crew includes three paying space tourists, two of whom are Saudis. The cost of the trip is undisclosed but rumored to be around $80 million per person. The mission will involve taking photographs of lightning strikes and working on a stem cell project for breast cancer research.\\n\\nThe following segment covers a fire at a school on the Northern Beaches. The fire, which started in an electricity substation, caused alarm among locals and threatened nearby homes. Firefighters extinguished the blaze in less than an hour, and school operations were not impacted. However, the fire is being investigated as a possible arson.\\n\\nThe next segment discusses the mortgage war in Australia. Major banks are cutting deals used to entice borrowers to switch lenders. These deals included frequent flyer points, up to $10,000 cashback, fee waivers, cheaper insurance, and even free internet. However, the mortgage war is coming to an end as banks are walking back these offers. CBA will cancel its cashback offers at the end of the month, and NAB will do the same from the end of June. Mortgage brokers warn that more borrowers are unable to refinance to cheaper lenders because they can no longer pass the stress test. In a surprising move, Westpac will now allow certain customers to borrow at a buffer below 3%.\\n\\nThe final segment reports on a potential cure for hemophilia B, a rare genetic disease. The drug, which costs $5 million per dose, is being tested in a groundbreaking trial at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Brett Bardney is one of 40 people in the world infused with the drug. The gene therapy involves infusing a safe virus carrying the factor 9 gene into the body, delivering the gene to the liver cells where doctors hope factor 9 is made for the rest of the patient's life.\",\n    \"KeyLocationsAndScenes\": [\n      \"Zip Co office\",\n      \"Shopping mall\",\n      \"9 News studio\",\n      \"Canada\",\n      \"SpaceX launch site\",\n      \"Inside the spacecraft\",\n      \"Axiom Space facility\",\n      \"International Space Station\",\n      \"Northern Beaches Secondary College Freshwater Senior Campus\",\n      \"Leichhardt Oval\",\n      \"Sydney\",\n      \"Royal Prince Alfred Hospital\",\n      \"Manila Post Office\"\n    ],\n    \"KeyThemes\": [\n      \"Buy now, pay later regulations\",\n      \"Space tourism\",\n      \"School fire\",\n      \"Mortgage war\",\n      \"Hemophilia B treatment\"\n    ],\n    \"PeopleAppearingAndMentioned\": [\n      \"Peter Gray\",\n      \"Fiona Guthrie\",\n      \"Chris Kohler\",\n      \"Rayyanah Barnawi\",\n      \"Peggy Whitson\",\n      \"Ali Alqari\",\n      \"Jonathan Kearsley\",\n      \"Maggie Raworth\",\n      \"Adam Dewberry\",\n      \"Darcy Byrne\",\n      \"Sally Tindall\",\n      \"Eddy Meyer\",\n      \"James Algar\",\n      \"Volodymyr Zelenskyy\",\n      \"Brett Bardney\",\n      \"John Rasko\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.12765291,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.16885665},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.22678408,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.37296242},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.111241356,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.1623801},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.07477004,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.13296436}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1289,"promptTokenCount":801198,"totalTokenCount":802487}}}

The narrator introduces the show, \\\"Married at First Sight,\\\" where twenty brave singles get married at first sight. One groom expresses his excitement, saying it's the first day of the rest of his life. Another couple walks down the aisle, hand in hand, beaming with joy. The narrator mentions that after just two weeks, love is already in the air. One bride expresses her happiness, saying no one has ever done something so thoughtful for her before. However, the video takes a turn as one bride, Shannan, confesses that she's still thinking about her ex and still loves him. The narrator reveals that the ghosts of the past are haunting some couples. Shannan explains that she almost didn't walk down the aisle because of her ex. During a boys' night out, Harrison takes another girl's phone number. The experts on the show express their shock and disapproval. The narrator mentions that Harrison lets Dan take the blame for taking the girl's number. Sandy, Dan's wife, questions him about it, and he denies giving his number to anyone. Sandy expresses her frustration, saying, \\\"Of course I'm going to react. What do you want me to do?\\\" Harrison is confronted by the group, and there's no place for him to run. Bronte, Harrison's wife, is in tears. The experts question Bronte about whether Harrison's actions make her question things. Harrison defends himself, saying he didn't want to reject the girl in front of the boys and deleted her number as soon as she walked off. The group isn't letting him off the hook. One expert says, \\\"There's intent behind taking someone's number, and that makes me sick to my stomach.\\\" Another expert agrees, saying, \\\"Yeah, me too.\\\" For some couples, the night is filled with fireworks and celebrations of their romantic bonds. One bride declares, \\\"I think I have the best husband!\\\" Another couple, Claire and Jesse, prove that love conquers all. The experts ask Jesse if he has romantic feelings for Claire, and he replies, \\\"Well, yeah, I like her.\\\" However, Shannan once again shocks the entire room. The expert expresses his disgust. Harrison says he will do something he's never done before. He places his wedding ring on a table and leaves. The narrator states that intimacy week has come to an end for some couples, and the week has helped them reach a new level in their relationship. One couple cuddles in bed, and the woman asks, \\\"How are you feeling?\\\" The man replies, \\\"Good.\\\" Another couple lies in bed, and the woman asks, \\\"Are you awake?\\\" The man replies, \\\"Mhm.\\\" She asks, \\\"Can I make you breakfast?\\\" He replies, \\\"At least, that would be lovely.\\\" After Jesse accused Claire of cheating with Adam, intimacy week has resulted in a major turnaround for the couple. Claire brings Jesse a cup of coffee in bed. They talk about how their feet touched during the night. Claire says she's a foot person, and Jesse says he was worried she wasn't and would be upset that their feet touched. Claire says, \\\"I think we're making really, really good progress. We're really just enjoying each other's company and really bouncing off each other.\\\" For Bronte and Harrison, their journey in the experiment hasn't been easy. At last night's dinner party, Harrison admitted he had taken another woman's number on a night out with some of the boys. Bronte wakes up and removes her sleep mask. Harrison explains that a girl came up to them at the bar and asked for his number, and he said no but took hers. Bronte says, \\\"It doesn't bother me. It's just a number. He says he deleted it.\\\" She adds, \\\"I've been in that situation before, and the only reason I've ever given my number away is so that the person just leaves me alone.\\\" She says Harrison probably should have said he was married, but it's a lesson. Harrison says, \\\"I handled that situation as best I could at the time, and Bronte understands that. It is what it is. So, for me, it's over.\\\" However, Bronte and Harrison weren't the only couple affected by the events at last night's dinner party. Sandy and Dan discuss the incident. Sandy says she was upset and lashed out because she likes Dan and doesn't want to become more vulnerable with someone who isn't in the same place as her. She says she can't have his back if he's giving out his number or taking numbers from girls. Dan says he wasn't involved and doesn't know why Harrison would say that. Sandy says, \\\"You were with Harrison, and Harrison is saying that he got a girl's number, and he's also saying that you got a girl's number. If you didn't do it, why is he saying it? He must have done it. Why would you say that?\\\" Dan says, \\\"I don't know why he would say that. It was just an innocent drink at a bar.\\\" He adds, \\\"I'm a bit mad, a bit angry, a bit pissed off. Harrison bringing down our relationship into that situation is not on.\\\" Sandy says, \\\"So you can't blame me if someone's saying those exact words. I, at least, am listening to it, but I'm not saying I'm believing it. But it's still a lot. Like someone says that to you, and you're just like, 'Oh, hang on a second.' Here I am thinking like, 'Everything's going well, everything's great,' and then I'm there, and they're saying this stuff to me, I'm like, 'Wait, what? Am I an idiot?'\\\" Dan says, \\\"Nothing happened.\\\" Sandy says, \\\"Yeah, so at least we're on the same page with that. You would believe that that's not acceptable behavior for someone that's married.\\\" Dan agrees. Sandy says, \\\"I have my own, obviously, trust issues. But so far, his actions say that he's a truthful person, and I can trust him. So, I need to believe that what Dan is saying is true.\\\" She says she wants to move past it. If he didn't do it, that's all she's focusing on at the moment. If she has any other reason not to believe him, they'll have that chat. Lyndon and Alyssa are getting ready to go out. Lyndon tells Alyssa he'll give her a kiss but doesn't want any of her red lippy on him. He kisses her forehead. Lyndall and Cameron hug and kiss. The narrator says, \\\"With the second commitment ceremony looming, our couples soon decide whether they will continue in the experiment or leave.\\\" Claire and Jesse are drinking champagne. Melissa criticizes Josh for his lack of physical intimacy. She says, \\\"You have a problem with intimacy, Josh, and I'm too much for you, and you don't know what to do.\\\" Josh says, \\\"I am too much for you.\\\" Melissa says, \\\"No, I am, Josh, and I'm going to speak my truth for every god damn woman in the world.\\\" Josh says, \\\"Having someone personally attack you is not my idea of a relationship.\\\" Melissa asks, \\\"Are you ready to go?\\\" Josh says, \\\"Yeah, I'm ready.\\\" Melissa says, \\\"You look nice.\\\" Josh says, \\\"You look very nice as well.\\\" Josh says, \\\"There's been really great moments in this marriage. When I turned around when I first saw Mel at the altar, I felt an instant connection. I felt a calmness and a reassurance.\\\" There's a flashback to Josh and Melissa's wedding. Josh says, \\\"There has been nice moments during intimacy week. We had a lot of fun in our place and a lot of laughs.\\\" Melissa says, \\\"This is going to be big. Just like Thor's hammer. There's going to be a lot of Thor's hammer jokes here.\\\" Josh laughs.

A man with long white hair and a beard appears on the screen, saying that it should never have been a crime and that the truck driver should never have been there. A woman with blonde hair appears on the screen, saying that he shouldn't have been on the road. The bearded man agrees. The bald man appears again, saying that people get carried away with their own authority, and tragedies like this can happen. A hand reaches for a red book labeled \\\"Holy Bible\\\" on a shelf. The bald man reappears, walking into a church and placing the Bible on a lectern. The narrator states that as the former head of the church in Australia, David Vickery knows the Potter's House better than just about anyone. He spent three decades in it before leaving with his family. These days, he can see how entrenched they all were in the church's fundamental doctrine. Vickery says that if he didn't know the Potter's House, he would be just as incredulous as the viewer, and it's hard to believe how anybody could lack such basic common sense and understanding, and certainly to depart so far from those basic tenets of Christian faith. The blonde woman asks if it's brainwashing. Vickery says that if you remove outside voices and then just keep everybody in-house and then feed them the narrative you want them to have, it's a form of brainwashing. Vickery is shown working at a table with a Bible and another book. The narrator states that during his decade-long tenure as leader, David met Simon Tuteru, who was the pastor of a small Potter's House church in Melbourne. He's not surprised to hear the truck driver's allegations about Tuteru and his interest in witchcraft. Vickery says that Simon Tuteru had pastored in Africa and had seen that sort of thing going on there, had embraced it, brought it back to Australia, and somehow he felt that that was a platform of truth that he could speak from. The blonde woman asks what he knew of Simon Tuteru. Vickery says that he was a very warm, friendly, caring sort of person, a good guy, a good person. The blonde woman says that he's not someone you would think would deliberately cause harm. Vickery agrees. A hand picks up a book titled \\\"Cults: Too Good to be True.\\\" A man with a long white beard and a yarmulke is shown reading in a library. The narrator states that the director of Cult Consulting Australia, Raphael Aron, believes the religious brainwashing of Tuteru at the Potter's House played a significant role in his decision-making. Aron says that the presentation of the truck driver should have been such to be able to alarm him and concern him. The blonde woman says that most people watching would be really alarmed to think that the beliefs of a pastor or a church leader could potentially play a role in such a tragedy. Aron says that once that critical thinking tap has been turned off, and they become totally subjugated to what this organization is all about, then really anything can happen. If one is at that point where it's God telling me this, then it becomes very, very difficult to resist that message and follow a different path. Photographs of the four deceased police officers are shown again. The narrator states that until the deaths of the four police officers, the Potter's House church had operated under the radar in Australia for more than 40 years. There are now 72 churches scattered across the country. And, as you'll see, what goes on inside the church is not only astonishing, it could be dangerous. Footage of a church service is shown, where a pastor is performing a healing ritual on a woman. He says, \\\"And I break this curse.\\\" The scene transitions to the blonde woman and a woman with long brown hair watching the footage on a laptop. The brown-haired woman begins to cry. The pastor in the video continues, \\\"That twisting spirit leave my spine.\\\" The brown-haired woman covers her face with her hands. The pastor in the video says, \\\"In Jesus' name.\\\" Text appears on the screen: \\\"Under the Influence.\\\" The 60 Minutes logo appears. More footage of the healing crusade is shown, with the pastor praying over different people. The blonde woman asks Vickery what he sees as the dangers when that ideology gets out into the community. He says that he thinks there are serious threats to people's safety when people like that are making decisions that are affecting other people's lives or their livelihoods or how they go about their work. He thinks that's very dangerous. The bearded man says that Tuteru's beliefs overrode what he was supposed to be doing. The bearded man is shown standing in front of a Victoria Police memorial. Plaques with the names of the deceased police officers are shown. The narrator states that Stuart Schultz is still grieving the loss of his wife, Lynette Taylor, in the truck crash. Having only recently learned about the link with the cult-like Potter's House church, he's furious they're allowed to push their alarming doctrine. The blonde woman asks what he sees as the dangers when that ideology gets out into the community. The bearded man says that there are serious threats to people's safety when people like that are making decisions that are affecting other people's lives, livelihoods, or how they go about their work. He thinks that's very dangerous. Vickery says that it's extreme, and there's no gray area, no \\\"Hey, maybe we can consult with doctors on this.\\\" It's this adamant sense that \\\"I'm right, this is witchcraft, and now we're going to pray, and you're going to be fine.\\\" Footage of the healing crusade is shown again, with the pastor praying over a young girl. The narrator states that next up at the healing crusade is this young girl who's got scoliosis, a physical curvature of the spine that can be debilitating. But Pastor Greg Mitchell tells her she's been cursed. The blonde woman and the brown-haired woman are watching the footage again. The blonde woman says that it seems ludicrous for outsiders, but for the indoctrinated, it's very real. The brown-haired woman says that it's hard to watch. The blonde woman says that it is. The brown-haired woman says that it's heartbreaking, just the way they talk to her. The blonde woman says that the pastor is playing God. The brown-haired woman says that he's saying to the girl that it's her fault she got what she got. Footage of the healing crusade continues, with the pastor praying over different people. The narrator states that our undercover footage reveals the church's extreme approach to illness. The former head of the Potter's House church in Australia, David Vickery, now agrees that the ideology is harmful. Vickery says that it's extreme. \\\"You've got this because of that, you've got this because of that,\\\" and there's no gray area, no \\\"Hey, maybe we can consult with doctors on this.\\\" It's this adamant sense that \\\"I'm right, this is witchcraft, and now we're going to pray, and you're going to be fine.\\\" Footage of the healing crusade is shown again, with the pastor praying over the young girl. The blonde woman and the brown-haired woman are watching the footage again. The brown-haired woman begins to cry. The blonde woman tells her to take her time. The brown-haired woman and a man embrace. The blonde woman says that it's hard to watch. The brown-haired woman says that it is. She says that it's heartbreaking, just the way they talk to her. The blonde woman asks what if the girl had done wrong. The brown-haired woman says that the pastor is saying that it's her fault she got what she got. More footage of the healing crusade is shown. The narrator states that it's just one of many serious medical conditions the church strangely blames on human behavior, curses, and witchcraft. The church's healing booklet is shown. The narrator states that according to the booklet, colon cancer is caused by a curse, heart conditions by resentment, and a stroke is triggered by hatred and self-pity. The skin condition eczema is blamed on witchcraft. The church believes all of it can be helped with prayer. The blonde woman and the brown-haired woman are looking at the healing booklet. The blonde woman points to entries in the booklet. The brown-haired woman says that prayer isn't going to fix colon cancer, any cancer, or diabetes. It's ridiculous. You're sick because you're not praying enough. The blonde woman points to more entries in the booklet. The brown-haired woman says that's horrible. A sunset over a city skyline is shown. The brown-haired woman is standing by a lake. The narrator states that for Katrina, the constant praying was distressing and even physically confronting. The brown-haired woman says that they all put their hands on her and would pray really loudly, speaking in tongues. She distinctly remembers them commanding the demon of lust out of her. She was a kid, six or something. She just thought she was bad and had a demon. The blonde woman is listening intently. More footage of the healing crusade is shown. The narrator states that it's just one of many serious medical conditions the church strangely blames on human behavior, curses, and witchcraft. A healing booklet is shown again."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.3259496,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.2861694},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.3293916,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.30486867},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.4943238,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.36206627},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.26588073,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.32338032}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":2443,"promptTokenCount":843087,"totalTokenCount":845530}}}

Giancarlo says that his life was crumbling in front of him. His professional reputation and everything was crumbling. He texted Becky and said that whenever they find his lifeless body, please return his dog to his family. He wanted to get away from the Falwells. He wanted nothing to do with them at that point. But all the doors were closing. The Falwells had made it clear that if Giancarlo raised the alarm, he’d be painted as an extortionist who’d made the whole thing up. But they didn’t realize he had the proof he needed to show it was Becky who was the protagonist and Jerry was in on it all too. Giancarlo had filmed a FaceTime call from the married mother of three as she boasted about their wild sexual rendezvous and Jerry was there again, watching on. The smoking gun was the FaceTime recording from January 2019. It’s case closed right there. Everything that he said, he promised that it’s all backed by evidence. \\n\\nTom asks Giancarlo what Becky is saying to him in that video. Giancarlo says that she’s just walking around her house with the camera pointing at her. She’s naked, topless, completely naked. Nothing on and she has a glass of white wine. She’s just kind of pointing at every spot that they had sex in. So, like, do you remember that spot? And it was like the kitchen island. Then she went up to one of the kid’s rooms. She’s like, do you remember that? He’s like, yeah. Tom asks if she had sex with him in her own children’s bedrooms. Giancarlo says that looking back now, it’s very weird to think about, but yes, they had sex in one of her kid’s rooms. They had sex obviously in her master bedroom. He believes that it’s case closed. If you actually analyze all the evidence, it’s just undeniable.\\n\\nThe news reports that Falwell Jr. resigns from Liberty University amid scandal. Despite his defense that it was all in good fun, Liberty University put the 58-year-old on indefinite leave. When Giancarlo Granda finally revealed all in 2020, it made headline news around the world. Falwell told CBS News he believes he was targeted because he’s a supporter of Donald Trump. Later that day, Jerry Falwell Jr. resigned as president of Liberty University. Mark Ebner is a New York Times best-selling author who’s now written a book on this extraordinary political and religious scandal. He says that they really believed that they were untouchable. Tom asks if he thinks the Falwells were drunk on power. Mark says that one thing, and it’s almost cliche, is that Jerry Falwell Jr. said to Giancarlo when he was being courted by Trump for a position actually in his cabinet, he was being wooed. And when Giancarlo said, listen, do you see yourself as ever running for office? And how Jerry Falwell Jr. responded? He said, Giancarlo, it’s better to be a kingmaker than a king. He knew his power, he knew the power of his power, but he also knew that it had limits.\\n\\nTom Steinfort calls Jerry Falwell Jr. on FaceTime and tells him that 60 Minutes Australia has conceded that his wife had a lengthy affair with Giancarlo Granda. But when they contacted him on Thursday, he was adamant he was never involved in the sexual relationship. Tom asks if it happened, the three-way tryst. Jerry says no. He just walked in three times after he knew what was going on, walked out, and that’s all he’s remembering. But he never took part. Never, never. Tom asks why he would make this up. Jerry says money, money. That’s it. A few hours after Tom’s call with Jerry Falwell, another twist. Becky got in touch demanding her say as well. Becky says that she can’t do a FaceTime right now because she’s in bed. Becky accepts she did the wrong thing, but says she’s sick of her entire family being punished for it. She says that the most important thing about Christianity is that everyone makes mistakes and everyone sins. And then the whole point of Jesus Christ coming and dying on the cross was to forgive the sinners for their sins. And so the whole hypocrisy thing is a bunch of bullshit because nobody is perfect. And why is she held at a different standard because her husband was a president of a university?\\n\\nMark says that Becky Falwell is like, well, Jerry forgives me. And so that makes everything all right. Does Jesus forgive you? Does your God forgive you? Well, she probably believes that’s the case, but she missed one key point of forgiveness. And that is a speck of remorse maybe. A willingness to make amends. None of that factors in with the Falwells. And so, consequently, they can burn in hell. After nearly a decade of mind games, Giancarlo Granda is now finally able to speak the truth about the scandal that dominated his 20s. But he says as he enters his 30s, he’s more mature for the experience and definitely much stronger. It’s been a wild ride. Tom asks if he would do it all again. Giancarlo says that it’s a dark chapter in his life, tough moments. They build character, right? So, there was a point where he was in a really dark place and he regretted everything. But he realized that look, this is out of his control. It happened. He can’t really do that, but he feels like he’s a stronger person now because of it. And again, he feels proud for exposing corruption, for exposing predatory behavior, and just kind of standing up for himself. He believes that his younger self would be proud of him. Tom Steinfort ends the program and asks viewers to have their say about the show on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. He also asks viewers to catch up on anything they’ve missed and their extra minute segments on 9Now. He says that they’ll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.18713295,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE","severityScore":0.17895599},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.1801067,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.2494475},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.43734318,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.35131136},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE","probabilityScore":0.39326817,"severity":"HARM_SEVERITY_LOW","severityScore":0.38306442}]}],"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-pro-002@default","usageMetadata":{"candidatesTokenCount":1445,"promptTokenCount":833648,"totalTokenCount":835093}}}
