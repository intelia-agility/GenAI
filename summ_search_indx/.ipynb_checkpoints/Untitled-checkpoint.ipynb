The subsequent aerial view of the city at night, emblazoned with phrases like “Shaw and Investments” and “Shaw and Trust,” hints at the scope of Ridgeway's influence and the potential impact of his confession.

Consumed by guilt, Ridgeway expresses a desperate need to apologize to those he harmed, claiming a desire for self-honesty and accountability for his actions.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the sincerity of his remorse, Ridgeway has agreed to cooperate with investigative journalist Adele Ferguson. He promises to unveil a still-active global financial scheme, detailing his involvement and the devastating impact on his clients.

This second man is linked to North Korean mining companies, identified as Sutton. The connection between these two seemingly disparate individuals hinges on a failed English bank, First London, to which Turner is also linked.\\n\\nThe focus shifts to Ridgeway, who asserts that Turner and Sutton hold the key to uncovering the missing funds.  He firmly believes that a thorough investigation into their activities will reveal the truth.  This conviction is met with skepticism from Adele Ferguson, who directly questions Ridgeway's suspicion, wondering if he genuinely believes the two men are con artists.

Despite being supposedly retired, Reynolds finds herself working as a courier, a situation she hadn't envisioned for this stage of her life.  The unexpected turn of events is juxtaposed with a photograph showing a gathering of people, some in suits, at her husband Mark's funeral.  Ridgeway, a close friend of Mark and even a pallbearer, is visible in the background of the picture.  \\n\\nAt the time of Mark's death, Ridgeway was a trusted member of their circle. The scene and Reynolds's reflections hint at a shift in their relationship dynamic, likely linked to the circumstances surrounding her current employment.  The contrast between Ridgeway's ostentatious car and Reynolds's practical one, coupled with her surprise at her courier job, suggests a possible financial disparity and perhaps even a betrayal of trust by Ridgeway, leading to Reynolds's present predicament. The interview with Adele Ferguson continues, promising to reveal more about this intriguing story.\\n\"],\n",
       " 'output_text': 'A joint investigation by 60 Minutes, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Age, titled \"THE CONFESSION,\" exposes a sprawling international financial scheme orchestrated by Chris Ridgeway, impacting hundreds of Australian families and thousands globally, with potential losses reaching millions of dollars.  The investigation, introduced by news anchor Tara Brown, centers on Ridgeway\\'s confession, a decision highlighted by his departure from a secluded area in his Porsche Macan, license plate “RIDGYS,” a symbol of his ill-gotten gains.  His meticulous attention to his appearance before the confession underscores his vanity and desire to control his narrative.\\n\\nRidgeway, formerly a senior advisor at Shaw and Partners, admits to defrauding clients and friends, leaving them financially ruined.  He expresses remorse and a desire to expose the scheme, collaborating with investigative journalist Adele Ferguson to reveal its intricacies and global reach. The investigation coincides with a nationwide Optus outage disrupting services for some Sydney Morning Herald and The Age subscribers, primarily affecting their contact center and delivery operations, prompting the newspapers to direct customers to online help platforms.\\n\\nThe scheme, estimated to involve losses of $5.5 billion USD, has left victims worldwide not only financially devastated but also deeply embarrassed and ashamed. Ridgeway implicates Andy Turner and David Sutton, both already under scrutiny by financial authorities, as key players in the scheme.  Turner, based in Britain, and Sutton, operating from Australia, are linked through the failed English bank, First London. While Turner boasts about his car collection, Sutton is connected to North Korean mining companies.\\n\\nRidgeway\\'s role was to lure investors into Turner and Sutton\\'s scheme with promises of high returns, receiving substantial kickbacks in return. He falsely claimed endorsements from Shaw and Partners, pocketing $1.6 million to fund a lavish lifestyle, hiding the true source of his wealth from his clients.  He concealed these substantial commissions, portraying them as standard practice.\\n\\nThe investigation also highlights the story of Leeth Reynolds, a widow forced to work as a courier despite being retired.  Her husband, Mark, was a close friend of Ridgeway, who even served as a pallbearer at his funeral.  The stark contrast between Reynolds\\'s modest Mazda CX-30 and Ridgeway\\'s luxury car, along with her unexpected employment, suggests a potential financial disparity and betrayal of trust, further illustrating the devastating consequences of Ridgeway\\'s actions. The ongoing interview with Adele Ferguson promises to uncover more details of this complex and heartbreaking story.\\n'}"

      "* **Data Drift:** Models can perform poorly if the live data deviates from the training data (data drift). Upstream system changes can also cause bad predictions.\n",
      "* **Monitoring:** A monitoring engine uses inference logs to detect anomalies (skews and outliers).\n",
      "* **Monitoring Process:**\n",
      "    * Inference logs (request/response data) are sampled and stored.\n",
      "    * The engine periodically analyzes the logs, generates a schema, and calculates statistics.\n",
      "    * The engine compares the generated schema to a reference schema to identify schema skews. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Model Monitoring Process:**  The system monitors production data (serving data) and compares it to the training data to identify anomalies and performance decay.\n",
      "* **Drift Detection:**  This involves checking for schema skew (differences in data structure) and distribution skew (changes in the distribution of feature values) between training and serving data. Other techniques like novelty detection, outlier detection, and feature attribution changes are also used.\n",
      "* **Performance Evaluation:** If ground truth (actual outcomes) is available for the serving data, the system evaluates the model's predictive accuracy in real-world scenarios.\n",
      "* **Alerting:** If anomalies or performance decay are detected, alerts are sent to trigger investigation or retraining.\n",
      "* **Data and Concept Drift:** The system aims to detect these. Data drift refers to differences between training and serving data, while concept drift indicates a changing relationship between input features and the target variable.\n",
      "* **Ground Truth Storage:**  In some cases, the system stores ground truth data from the production environment. This data can be used for continuous evaluation and future model training.\n",

      "* This repository supports both batch serving (for experimentation, training, and batch prediction) and online serving (for real-time prediction).\n",
      "* Features, which are refined attributes of business entities (e.g., product, customer), are managed centrally.\n",
      "* This centralized feature management allows for standardized definition, storage, and access for training and serving.\n",
      "* The repository facilitates feature discoverability and reuse, preventing redundant feature creation.\n",
      "\n",
