       "  'headline': 'Curtis Sittenfeld’s celebrity romcom didn’t sweep me off my feet',\n",
       "  'description': 'Curtis Sittenfeld likes to pose questions with her novels. What if Hillary had refused to marry Bill? (Rodham.) What if Pride and Prejudice was set in contemporary times? (Eligible.) Why did Democrat-raised librarian Laura Bush marry boisterous Republican George W? (American Wife.)\\n There’s an entertainment tradition of ordinary looking talented men pairing with spectacularly beautiful women. But it would never happen if the genders were reversed – would it? That’s the premise of Sittenfeld’s sixth novel.\\n Sally Milner is a writer for TNO, a fictional Saturday Night Live. When her colleague Danny becomes engaged to a gorgeous celebrity, Sally writes a mocking sketch – The Danny Horst Rule – embodying the novel’s premise. That week, as she helps “cheesily handsome” pop-star guest host Noah write his own sketch, she feels an attraction spark. But it can’t be mutual – can it?\\n The narrative tension, as with any romantic comedy, lies not in whether an attraction exists, or even if it will be consummated, so much as how that will happen, and the specifics of the obstacles they’ll overcome. An awareness of these genre mechanics is written into the novel.\\n Sally’s ambition is “to write non-condescending, ragingly feminist screenplays for romantic comedies”. She tells Noah, “When one of these movies doesn’t work, it’s usually because it’s horribly written and/or because the script hasn’t done the work of convincing you the couple is attracted to each other, so then you don’t care if obstacles get in their way and keep them apart.”\\n Sittenfeld creates a convincing connection between Sally and Noah: they describe their creative work – her comedy and his music – as the loves of their lives. So it makes sense that work is how their true selves are revealed and connect.\\n The conflict between our public and private selves has been central to Sittenfeld’s work since her debut, Prep, whose hyperaware, awkward teen protagonist embodied it. Sally suspects much of her writing emerges from that tension. And she tells Noah, “Sometimes I feel like I’m writing dialogue for the character of myself. I’m impersonating a normal human being when really I’m a confused freak.”\\n This aspect of Sally feels palpably real and suits a comedy writer: humour as armour; a protective layer to shield the real, vulnerable self. And theories such as the Danny Horst Rule feel like believable ways of protecting against romantic rejection.\\n Sally hasn’t allowed herself to have real relationships since a fellow TNO writer denied a mutual attraction she’d imagined, years ago. (Another Sittenfeld theme: young Hillary misreads male friendships in Rodham, and a similar situation plays out in the title story of Sittenfeld’s collection, You Think It, I’ll Say It.) “You’ve confused the romance of comedy with the comedy of romance,” Sally’s colleague told her.\\n It’s a good line. But there aren’t enough of them in Romantic Comedy. Sittenfeld can be a master of sardonic, devastatingly arch observational wit. She employed it beautifully in Eligible; perhaps it helped to borrow the skeleton of the most popular romantic comedy of all time.\\n Comedy is subjective, of course, but I didn’t find the jokes in this novel very funny. A skit about dogs doing Google searches fell flat. I groaned at many behind-the-scenes barbs among the comedy writers, such as Danny’s: “It’s very demeaning that you think my vagina needs cleaning. It shouldn’t smell floral when I’m getting oral.”\\n And while Romantic Comedy convinces readers of the connection between Sally and Noah, its characters and world often lack the texture of real life. Noah, repeatedly referred to as “cheesily handsome”, often reads more like a cipher than a real person. He once greets Sally with, “Those are great fancy shoes.” Danny and Annabel’s relationship is cliched even when it tries to draw us in: Danny loves to gaze into Annabel’s eyes on her bed with a million pillows “like in the fanciest hotel”. And Sittenfeld often uses bland descriptions that show us nothing. In the TNO boss’ office, people sit on “the surprisingly crappy furniture in the surprisingly unfancy space”.\\n The pace crawls in the section set at TNO, which takes up nearly half the book. Sittenfeld comprehensively researched Saturday Night Live; unfortunately, the text is weighed down with mechanical detail about the running of the show. The prose comparatively springs in its absence after the action moves location halfway through.\\n Further drafts may have moved this novel past the stage of being bogged in research. They might have sharpened the details and honed the comedy. But as it stands, Romantic Comedy feels like a promising sketch for a better novel.\\n Romantic Comedy by Curtis Sittenfeld is published by Doubleday, $32.99.\\n Jo Case is deputy books and ideas editor for The Conversation.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'headline': 'The ‘anonymous mogul’ who’s behind your favourite TV comedies',\n",
       "  'description': 'Bill Lawrence has a gift for TV comedy and his special skill is ensembles. And while you might not be familiar with his name, it’s likely that you’ve seen, and perhaps even loved and admired, some of his work. It’s most recently on display in Shrinking and Ted Lasso (both Apple TV+), but stretches back to Spin City (Stan*) and Scrubs (Disney+).\\n Dubbed “Television’s Anonymous Mogul” in a Los Angeles Times profile, Lawrence has been working steadily for decades. Although in his early days he was sacked from the writing team on Friends – “I was a kid. I misbehaved a bit,” he subsequently explained – he soon rebounded. Teaming up with Gary David Goldberg (Family Ties), he created Spin City (1996-2002), the first of his beautifully balanced ensemble comedies.\\n In a long career, he’s had some misfires (remember Whiskey Cavalier, Undateable, Surviving Jack or Life Sentence? No? Not surprising). But the good ones are memorable and display a capacity to create vibrant communities in an array of settings: the New York mayor’s office in Spin City; a Sacramento hospital in Scrubs (2001-10); a fictional Florida district in Cougar Town (2009-15); an English soccer club in Ted Lasso; a Pasadena psychology practice in Shrinking.\\n Sometimes, his series feature workplace families with artfully jumbled bags of diverse personalities; sometimes they’re biologically connected families, along with their friends, neighbours and work colleagues. In classic sitcom style, each character contributes a distinctive note to the whole: a dumb one, a daffy one, a pompous one, a smart and sassy one, a neurotic, etc.\\n Wherever they live and whatever they do, in the best of Lawrence’s work these ensembles present vibrant, idiosyncratic and very funny characters in productions distinguished by clever casting and pitch-perfect tones. As neatly illustrated by Shrinking and Ted Lasso, they can bounce confidently from laugh-out-loud physical gags and goofy humour to more tender moments where the multi-dimensional characters reveal their vulnerabilities.\\n Lawrence isn’t a one-man band: often his comedies are created and produced with others. Ted Lasso was developed with Jason Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt and Joe Kelly, and there’s a phalanx of producers, including Brett Goldstein, who plays Roy Kent. But there’s a discernible thread running through Lawrence’s productions, no matter who he’s working with, and that’s the strength of the communities that he constructs.\\n One indicator of how well they’re structured is how many of the supporting characters become scene-stealers, even when the shows are ostensibly built around a prominent lead, such as Michael J. Fox in Spin City, Sudeikis in Ted Lasso or Jason Segel in Shrinking. That’s because the writing is so strong and the casting is spot on. The focus of Spin City might be Fox’s deputy mayor, but as well as giving us the wonderful Connie Britton in a feisty early role, there’s the joy of Richard Kind’s sweet, bumbling, perpetually flustered press secretary. Scrubs follows the misadventures of Zach Braff as the caring, adorably discombobulated Dr John “J.D.” Dorian. But Sarah Chalke’s contribution as the delightfully ditzy Dr Elliot Reid would be right at home in a classic 1930s Hollywood screwball comedy (which is high praise).\\n My litmus test of a great ensemble is that it’s hard to pick a favourite character. In Ted Lasso, for example, there’s robust competition for that distinction: is it the magnificently monosyllabic Roy Kent? Indomitable, effervescent Keeley (Juno Temple)? Sweet Nigerian winger Sam Obisanya (Toheeb Jimoh)? Perhaps Dani Rojas (Christo Fernandez) with his sunny smile and gleeful pronouncement that “Football is life!” Titular Ted might be the main man, but, while taking nothing away from the nominal protagonist, the wealth of talent around him makes the series stronger.\\n That’s also true of Shrinking, where co-creator and co-producer Segel plays Jimmy, a psychologist and widower grieving the recent death of his wife (Lilan Bowden) and destructively spiralling. As it begins, he’s seeking comfort in drugs and casual sex, and failing to be the parent that his wounded teenage daughter, Alice (Lukita Maxwell), desperately needs.\\n Jimmy works in a practice with a trio of therapists and each of them is as much in need of supportive counselling as their patients. Gaby (Jessica Williams) is dealing with divorce and blithely maintaining she’s fine, when clearly she isn’t. Paul (Harrison Ford) is trying to manage a health issue and is troubled by a strained relationship with his adult daughter (Lily Rabe).\\n Beyond the core characters is a skilfully fleshed-out community, among them Jimmy’s nosy neighbour, Liz (Christa Miller, Lawrence’s wife, who also appeared in Scrubs and Cougar Town), his best friend, hilariously fast-talking gay lawyer Brian (Michael Urie), and his patient, war veteran Sean (Luke Tennie), who’s suffering from PTSD and dealing with anger-management issues. Notably, too, Ford is in his element as the grumpy elder of the practice, a terse type who protectively guards his personal space only to find it continually invaded by his colleagues.\\n As with Ted Lasso – whose fourth season has been the subject of fervid speculation – Shrinking was originally pitched with a three-season structure, with the first to focus on grief, the second on forgiveness and the final one on moving forward.\\n The first season has set the bar high, with a line introduced in the first episode and repeated in the final one to significantly different effect neatly illustrating the quality of the writing. Initially, Jimmy looks lovingly at Alice and tells her how much she reminds him of her mother, an observation that’s filled with pain. In the final episode, when the line is repeated, there’s only love and pride. Without labouring the point, the series illustrates how far the pair has come.\\n It’s classic Lawrence. So remember the name, because when you see it on a comedy, it’s likely to be worth watching.\\n * Stan is owned by Nine, the owner of this masthead.\\n Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.

       "  'description': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nPet\\nCatherine Chidgey, Europa, $32.99\\n Writing the young is hard, and worst when they are in an abusive situation. Catherine Chidgey’s novel tells of innocence becoming experience, gradually, and her form is the psychothriller. Justine is 12, and has a crush on her charismatic teacher, Mrs Price. What anchors the book is the precise details of a New Zealand childhood from late last century, the games, lessons and lolly cigarettes. Sinister is a constant undertone, from petty thefts and casual racism to the school’s Catholic doctrines. Mrs Price has more than her class in thrall, for Justine’s widowed father has also fallen in love with her. The tension rises, page by page, with abortion clinic picketing and finally murder. Chidgey maintains momentum, her narrative hooking the reader’s attention. It should make one hell of a movie.\\n Strangers at the Port\\nLauren Aimee Curtis, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, $29.99\\n Sydney-born Lauren Aimee Curtis has already been named as a Best Young British novelist in Granta this year, so this second novel comes with expectations. It consists of three parts: the narrations of Giulia and Giovanna, two peasant sisters born on an island off Sicily, and that of a tourist, an Austrian Archduke. In the late 19th century the island follows immemorial rhythms, but change arrives. First come convicts, then the devastating phylloxera virus. It will force emigration, ending in Australia as an academic seeks the elderly Giovanna’s first-hand testimony. The parallels between modern eco-disaster and dislocation are clear, if not belaboured. The difficulty is that the pacing is languid, the lissom prose somehow lacking the urgency of what it describes. And quick Googling establishes that Archduke Ludwig Salvador, a “loose” model for Curtis, was rather more interesting than his fictionalisation, being a travel writer and early ecologist.\\n The Invisible Hour\\nAlice Hoffman, Scribner, $32.99\\n American writer Alice Hoffman has a long and successful career of bending genres. This novel uses the trope of travel into the past, not as young adult fare, but as high literary fandom. Teenage Mia has been reared in a patriarchal cult, where what is verboten for women includes libraries. Of course she disobeys, and discovers Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter. She sees the parallels with her life; it radicalises her. That is one half of The Invisible Hour, the other being struggling writer Hawthorne himself. That Mia should enter the past, his present, is dandy; less is their affair, which pushes the book into historical romance territory. Hawthorne was a Victorian male, who memorably complained of “damned scribbling women”, authors of trash that prevented his literary success. Despite the evocative writing, the two halves of the book work against each other.\\n The List\\nYomi Adegoke, Fourth Estate, $32.99\\n It’s rare that a modern novel is bang up-to-date. The List comes with maximum hype and a television series in production. Its angle? How cancel culture affects a relationship. Michael and Ola are a young power couple in London, scaling the internet to success. What is different is that both are African. The novel begins with them engaged, out on the town drunk and happy. Next comes crisis, when Michael is named on an e-list of abusive males. At stake is their planned wedding, an extravaganza costing thousands of pounds, and also their love. The book adroitly details consumer and pop culture, gender and racial identity. Nothing is simple, least of all self-examination and remaking a life. Yet despite the book’s craft, the vitality of Bernardine Evaristo or Nnedi Okorafor seems missing: it becomes a bit of a slog.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nBetter Than Happiness\\nGregory P. Smith, Penguin, $35\\n After 10 years living alone in a rainforest in northern NSW, Gregory Smith was sitting on a park bench longing for a friend when he experienced a “full-blown vision”. Suddenly, he was in the middle of a smouldering battlefield surrounded by the ruins of his life. Sword in hand he stood ready for attack – only to realise that he was the enemy. He had been fighting himself for too long. In that moment of grace, he swore off the alcohol, drugs and cigarettes he’d used to dull the pain of his traumatic childhood. It was the beginning of a remarkable journey of transformation and acceptance that lead him from homelessness to a fulfilling job as an academic, from emotional isolation to unconditional love. The epiphanies that allowed him to turn his life around make this wise and self-searching memoir an invaluable handbook for those looking for a path out of their own dark forest.\\n Close to the Subject\\nDaniel Browning, Magabala Books, $34.99\\n “I am a storyteller – nothing more,” says Daniel Browning. He might well have said “nothing less”, as the pieces in this collection from his three decades of work as a Bundjalung and Kullilli journalist, radio broadcaster and writer reveal storytelling to be the most expansive, all-embracing of forms. This understanding of storytelling coheres around the presence of the storyteller as interpreter, medium, editor, critic, commentator and showcaser of Indigenous voices, whether he is talking to Doris Pilkington, author of Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, teasing out the tale behind the plaster cast found in Lyon of an Aboriginal man from Fraser Island, reflecting on Warwick Thornton’s documentary about the uses and abuses of the Southern Cross or offering his own forceful critique of nationhood. “Australia is a shadow ... It plays out like an in-joke; no one is quite sure when to laugh.”\\n A Clear Flowing Yarra\\nHarry Saddler, Affirm Press, $29.99\\n So accustomed have Melburnians become to disparaging the Yarra that a joyful book about this waterway would have seemed, not long ago, to be a contradiction in terms. Then came the COVID lockdowns and we started to see the river and its tributaries in a different light. Harry Saddler takes this new appreciation to even greater heights in a book that exudes an infectious and giddy delight for its subject. There are encounters with platypuses from the riverbank in a suburban park. There are evenings spent listening to and eyeballing powerful owls. There are sightings of Salvatore, the adventurous seal. As he immerses himself in the river and its environs, he also gets to know the human creatures – from the Yarra River keeper to the community groups – who share his love of it, swim in it and care for it. If you thought you knew the Yarra, Saddler will make you think again.\\n Love, Dad\\nLaurie Steed, Fremantle Press, $32.99\\n Of the trials that heroes undergo in classical mythology, becoming a dad tends not to be one of them – which says a lot about traditional notions of masculinity. Laurie Steed believed he’d fashioned a workable “warrior-self” along the lines of the “tough, silent kind of manliness [that] was sold to us as boys”. Until fatherhood exposed his fault lines. As he stares into the eyes of his newborn son, he is struck by the fact that although he’s now a dad, he has not yet worked out how to be a man. Love, Dad is an open letter of gratitude to his sons for initiating him into a richer, more emotionally attuned version of manhood that fits his particular circumstances and deepens his relationship with his own father. This more nuanced self is not afraid to acknowledge his struggles, shortcomings and anxieties as a dad and a writer, while lovingly celebrating the wild ride of parenthood.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'The image presents a split composition, juxtaposing a headshot of a woman on the left with the cover of a book on the right.\\n\\n**Left Side (Headshot):**\\n\\nThe woman in the headshot appears to be middle-aged, with shoulder-length dark brown hair parted slightly off-center. Her expression is neutral, almost pensive, with her lips closed in a relaxed position. Her gaze is direct, looking straight at the camera. Her skin tone is light, with a natural complexion. She wears a dark v-neck shirt underneath a light gray, textured blazer or cardigan. The background consists of horizontal, dark-colored slats, likely part of a wall or other architectural feature. The lighting is even and soft, suggesting a professional or semi-professional setting for the photograph.\\n\\n**Right Side (Book Cover):**\\n\\nThe book cover features a vintage aesthetic, reminiscent of 1960s or 1970s fashion photography. A woman with long, light brown hair is seated in the driver\\'s seat of a convertible car. She wears large, round, white earrings and a flowing, sleeveless, mustard-yellow top or dress. Her profile is visible as she looks away from the camera, towards the road ahead.  She holds the steering wheel with one hand and rests the other on the car\\'s gear shift. The car itself is a light color, possibly white or cream, and the background suggests a cityscape or urban setting. The book title, \"ROMANTIC COMEDY,\" is displayed vertically along the left edge of the cover in bold, uppercase letters. The author\\'s name, \"CURTIS SITTENFELD,\" appears in a larger, bolder font at the bottom of the cover, also in uppercase.  Two blurbs, seemingly positive reviews or endorsements, are placed on the cover. One, attributed to Kate Atkinson, reads, \"One of my favourite writers\\'.\" The other, from Elizabeth Day, states, \"I am obsessed with this book. Warm, wise, extremely funny.\"  A smaller line of text at the bottom identifies the book as a \"Sunday Times and New York Times bestseller.\"\\n\\n**Relationship between the two halves:**\\n\\nThe juxtaposition strongly suggests that the woman in the headshot is Curtis Sittenfeld, the author of the book \"Romantic Comedy\" displayed on the right. The image likely serves as promotional material, combining a portrait of the author with the visually appealing book cover.\\n\\n**Detailed Description and Analysis:**\\n\\n**Headshot (Left):**\\n\\n* **Framing and Composition:** The headshot is tightly cropped, focusing on the woman\\'s face and upper torso.  The horizontal lines of the background provide a contrasting visual element to the subject\\'s vertical posture.\\n* **Lighting and Color:** The lighting is soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows and creating a natural look. The color palette is muted, with the gray blazer and dark shirt complementing the subject\\'s hair and skin tone.\\n* **Expression and Pose:** The woman\\'s expression is neutral and approachable, conveying a sense of confidence and professionalism. Her direct gaze engages the viewer, while her relaxed posture suggests a sense of ease and comfort.\\n\\n**Book Cover (Right):**\\n\\n* **Visual Style and Era:** The cover\\'s vintage aesthetic, characterized by the car, the woman\\'s clothing and hairstyle, and the color palette, evokes a sense of nostalgia and classic Hollywood glamour. This style likely aims to attract readers interested in romantic stories with a retro feel.\\n* **Typography and Layout:** The vertical placement of the title \"ROMANTIC COMEDY\" is unconventional yet eye-catching. The bold, uppercase font emphasizes the genre and creates a strong visual impact. The author\\'s name, prominently displayed at the bottom, reinforces brand recognition.\\n* **Imagery and Symbolism:** The image of the woman driving a convertible suggests independence, freedom, and a sense of adventure. The yellow top or dress adds a touch of vibrancy and optimism, while the urban setting hints at a sophisticated and contemporary backdrop for the story.\\n* **Blurbs and Endorsements:** The inclusion of positive blurbs from established authors like Kate Atkinson and Elizabeth Day adds credibility and social proof, encouraging potential readers to pick up the book.  The use of phrases like \"favourite writers\\',\" \"obsessed,\" \"warm,\" \"wise,\" and \"funny\" provides concise yet compelling insights into the book\\'s tone and content.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe combined image effectively promotes Curtis Sittenfeld\\'s book \"Romantic Comedy.\" The professional headshot presents the author in a relatable and approachable manner, while the eye-catching book cover conveys the genre and tone of the story. The vintage aesthetic and positive endorsements further enhance the book\\'s appeal, targeting readers seeking a lighthearted, romantic escape with a touch of classic Hollywood charm. The image is well-suited for use in online advertising, social media promotion, and other marketing materials.\\n\\n**Further Speculation and Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe title \"Romantic Comedy\" and the vintage aesthetic of the cover suggest a story that explores themes of love, relationships, and humor within a retro setting. The choice of a female protagonist driving a convertible might symbolize empowerment and a break from traditional gender roles. The endorsements hint at a well-written and engaging narrative that resonates with readers on an emotional level.\\n\\n**Target Audience:**\\n\\nThe image likely targets readers interested in romantic comedies, particularly those who appreciate a vintage aesthetic and witty writing. The endorsements from established female authors suggest a potential appeal to a predominantly female readership.\\n\\n**Marketing Strategy:**\\n\\nThe image\\'s clean design and clear messaging make it effective for various marketing channels. The combination of author portrait and book cover provides a comprehensive introduction to both the author and her work. The inclusion of endorsements and bestseller status adds credibility and encourages purchase consideration.\\n'},\n",

       "  'description': 'Six of the best diversions, including what to watch, read, eat and buy.\\n SPOTLIGHT / Star Witness Gwyneth Paltrow’s Trial Is Her Best Role in Years declared a recent headline in The New Yorker – and it’s not wrong. The Academy Award winner was the subject of a civil suit in a Utah court regarding a so-called ski-and-run accident in 2016. The actress was accused of running into a fellow skier while holidaying with her family. She said au contraire – he ran into her.\\n The court found in Paltrow’s favour (#Gwynnocent) but no one really cared about the nuts and bolts of the case. Instead, the world binged it like a Netflix drama, tuning in to check out Paltrow’s daily court looks (she’s wearing a turtleneck!) and quoting her most iconic one-liners, including the new meme: “Well, I lost half a day of skiing.”\\n It’s the latest in a long line of celebrity court battles to have captured the public fascination, stretching back to 1995 and OJ Simpson’s “trial of the century”. Last year delivered Johnny Depp v Amber Heard, which spawned a parallel trial on TikTok in which social media users declared Depp the innocent party and Heard guilty of, well, everything. A timely reminder, perhaps, that treating the courtroom as soap opera can have troubling real-world consequences. One worth remembering, given the next celebrity to take the stand will be one Donald Trump – a man who knows the power of performance better than anyone. Thomas Mitchell\\n SHOP / Swap shop Flaunting a fin-shaped design and made from repurposed coffee husks, the HuskeeCup is a stylish reminder to choose to reuse. Drinkers buy a cup, which come in a range of sizes, from a participating cafe (8oz cup in charcoal or natural, $20) when ordering their caffeine fix, then return it when placing their next order (no need to even wash it). The “deposited” cups are sanitised and put back in rotation, with customers leaving with their fave brew in a “new” one. In due course, all cups, lids and saucers can be returned to Huskee or its swap partners – an app shows their locations – for end-of-life recycling. Frances Mocnik\\n EAT / Golden brown Spice up your weekend with a teaspoon of Golden Vadouvan, a sweet, smoky spice blend of roasted onions and garlic with turmeric, mustard seed, bittersweet fenugreek and more (150g, $22.50). It’s Indian but also French, said to have been created by the French colonists of Pondicherry (now Puducherry) on India’s south-eastern coast, and it will take your salmon kedgeree to the next level. Beat it into butter to pan-fry fish and melt over carrots, or just sprinkle over your weekend eggs for an instant wow factor. Jill Dupleix\\n READ / Role reversal Ever wondered why good-looking, talented women often date average-looking but interesting guys, while the reverse rarely happens? In Romantic Comedy by American novelist Curtis Sittenfeld, Sally is a divorced 30-something writer for a hit TV comedy show. Fed up with seeing gorgeous female celebrities hook up with the show’s dorky male writers, she writes a sketch about it. Enter Noah, a handsome rock star and guest on the show. The sexual tension escalates as they banter their way through lockdown via email. Among the book’s pithy one-liners: “Hot eventually gets boring but funny never does.” Sittenfeld has form in analysing relationships: she’s the author of bestselling 2020 novel Rodham, which reimagined the life Hillary Rodham would have had if she’d not married Bill Clinton. Nicole Abadee\\n WEAR / Step right up How many pairs of shoes does a man need? Four, according to the founders of shoe company Etymology – Gabriel Abi-Saab and brothers William and Albert Phung. A loafer or two, an Oxford and something not black. The Sydney-based trio founded the company during the pandemic and this month released their four-pair debut collection, which leans heavily into the loafer. The all-leather shoes are handcrafted in family-run workshops in the Spanish shoe-making capital of Almansa, and retail here online for $425 a pair. The inspiration? Abi-Saab’s Lebanese-Australian heritage: “My dad always wore this pair of loafers he found in Lebanon, even when going to the greengrocers. He took pride in the way he dressed.” Taking following in dad’s footsteps to a whole new level. Melissa Singer\\n WATCH / Dead Ringers It’s always a concern when a TV series or film casts an actor to star opposite themselves; the double-up can be great but can also be a gimmick used to paper over a thin plot. It worked a treat for Eddie Murphy in Coming To America but not in The Nutty Professor, while John Malkovich proved there is no such thing as too much Malkovich in Being John Malkovich. Thankfully, British actress Rachel Weisz is so charming in Dead Ringers (Amazon Prime) that you never get sick of seeing her star alongside herself. In this modern take on David Cronenberg’s 1988 thriller, Weisz plays twin gynaecologists whose desperation to change how women give birth pushes them into ethically questionable territory.

       "  'headline': 'Yes, the men of Sex and the City were awful, but things are improving',\n",
       "  'description': 'The interaction of the past with the present is the faultline on which great stories are built, sure. But many Sex and the City superfans were dismayed to learn, via the trailer for the second series of SATC’s sequel And Just Like That, that the show will recycle Carrie’s old boyfriend Aidan into her life.\\n Aidan Shaw was one of the two most important of Carrie’s love interests during the long-running show, the beta male in the love triangle he (unwittingly) participated in with Carrie and the horrendous Big.\\n Big was the alpha whose emotional avoidance was dressed up as mystery, a man so emotionally unavailable that Carrie never even felt entitled to use his real name (which turned out to be John – apt because Big/John was revealed to be decidedly average once Carrie finally captured him and they settled down).\\n Aidan was folksy and handsome, a carpenter who worked with his hands and wore lumberjack shirts without any apparent sense of irony. He loved his dog. He loved Carrie. He made a chair that she bought for her apartment. What could be so bad about that?\\n As many SATC scholars have elucidated since, Aidan didn’t really love Carrie just as she was. He hated her smoking. He hated her going out. He hated her attachment to her glamorous lifestyle. Had he even met Carrie? That’s all she was – a smoker with a glamorous lifestyle who enjoyed going out a lot.\\n Aidan hauled Carrie, the Manhattan denizen fuelled by Cosmopolitans and the New York Times Style section, into the woods to hang out at his bug-infested cabin. He trapped her into commitment by buying the apartment next door and knocking down the wall between them. She felt invaded. Was it any wonder she resumed the ciggies in secret and started an affair with the now-married Big?\\n Yes, Carrie was awful: neurotic, flighty, self-absorbed and terrible with money. But she was not as bad as the men she dated.\\n To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the iconic show – which was probably the biggest single cultural influence on women of a generation – Vanity Fair published an article titled “Who was the worst man on Sex and the City?”\\n It’s a close-fought contest. My vote would go to the horrid Jack Berger, a brooding wannabe literary novelist who went into a prolonged sulk when Carrie’s (non-literary and therefore inferior, in his eyes) book was published to great success.\\n Many of Carrie’s romantic trials involved men who were attracted to her success and independence but were threatened by it. Big at least let Carrie be Carrie. But even the bad men of Sex and the City all had something superficially attractive about them.\\n The annals of romantic comedy are full of unkempt and even oafish men who score hot babes – think the 2007 Judd Apatow film Knocked Up, in which a stoner slacker (played by Seth Rogen) wins over the successful and attractive Alison, after impregnating her during a one-night stand. Or Notting Hill, where the hopeless Hugh Grant character snags a movie star.\\n Woody Allen’s entire oeuvre (which has become tricky anyway, for other well-documented reasons I won’t delve into here) depends upon the premise that a beautiful, clever woman will be irresistibly drawn to a nebbish, prickly man who is deeply selfish, just because he cracks a few self-deprecating jokes and knows a lot about classic cinema.\\n Many sitcoms rely on the trope of a grumpy and/or hopeless husband who is adored by his efficient and attractive wife (my favourite episode of The Simpsons is where Marge snaps because she doesn’t get enough help around the house; she is sent away for a break to a spa called Rancho Relaxo. But Homer is so incompetent he loses baby Maggie while his wife is away and has to call a Missing Baby Hotline to locate her).\\n It has been a quarter-century since Sex and the City first aired, and it busted genres while creating its own. It has heavily influenced its successors – everything from the Millennial homage of Girls, to shows like Derry Girls, the delightful Irish comedy series about a group of teenagers, whose antics are set against the backdrop of Northern Ireland during the Troubles in the mid-1990s.\\n In the ensuing decades, the ideal male romantic lead has evolved somewhat. The recent bestselling book by cult American author Curtis Sittenfeld, Romantic Comedy, up-ends the trope of the “schlubby” male hero who lands the hot, eligible chick just by making her laugh.\\n The book asks why the opposite case is not often portrayed - why do we never see a frumpy-but-funny woman capturing the attention of a handsome, highly successful hero? (Although it must be said, Bridget Jones was a bit this person.)\\n It then goes on to explore that very scenario, with a male love interest who is hot, talented and famous, but also slightly insecure (he wears a wig). Our hero openly admits he is no match for the clever wit of our heroine, who has sub-Hollywood looks and is skittish around commitment.\\n The world’s most-read contemporary author, Colleen Hoover, who has barnstormed traditional publishing with her popular fiction, upturned the ideal of the male hero in her most famous book, It Ends With Us. The hero is introduced as dark, mercurial and emotionally elusive, but when the heroine finally lands him, she finds out the truth – he is prone to volcanic rages, and he hurts her when he’s in the grips of them.\\n In this story, the archetypal hero is a trap, and the heroine’s real struggle is to free herself. The heroines of 2023 crave freedom, and men who will give it to them. But romance still has a momentum of its own – Hoover wrote the sequel, It Starts With Us, because her fans wanted her to, and they specifically told her they wanted their heroine to fall in love again and stay there, this time.\\n Reader: she gave them what they wanted.\\n Jacqueline Maley is a columnist.\\n The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own.

       "  'description': 'HOLLYWOOD\\nBurn It Down: Power, Complicity and a Call for Change in Hollywood \\nMaureen Ryan\\nHarperCollins, $60\\n Maureen Ryan is as mad as hell about what’s been happening in Hollywood. And the Vanity Fair contributing editor has written Burn It Down to tell readers why. “What should be assessed is not just the creative product, its financial cost, and its efficiency (or lack thereof),” she writes, “It’s also how productive and nurturing an environment it is.” Something that she goes to great lengths to explain isn’t happening now and never has been.\\n Her book, which deals mainly but not exclusively with the world of television, was written before the recent strikes by the American Writers and Screen Actors Guilds and doesn’t deal directly with the specific issues that have provoked them. But it does point to a range of resentments that have been simmering away for years, to do with how workplaces that ought to service the needs of employees have frequently become hellholes.\\n To most readers, much of this won’t come as a surprise. Hollywood has long been infamous for what was once seen as routine behaviour but is now regarded as disreputable. The public testimonies of the courageous survivors of sexual assaults by men in powerful positions have exposed some of the darker activities hidden behind the surface gloss of the American film business.\\n Ryan mentions in passing that she herself suffered this fate at the hands of an unnamed TV executive. She wrote at some length about it in Variety in October 2017, and her smouldering anger about what happened permeates the book.\\n Drawing on the experiences of a young actress, she even goes so far as to liken what goes on in Hollywood to the way cults conduct themselves. “How is a cult that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day all that different from a set (or a workplace) that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day?“\\n Her overall approach is messy, featuring long-winded attempts to explode myths about the Hollywood business, most of which were blasted to smithereens long ago. But she also provides compelling, detailed accounts of the failures and moral breakdowns that have occurred behind the scenes on the long-running series, Lost (2004–2010) and Sleepy Hollow (2013–2017), and that (contrary to the view that emerges, fictionalised, in Curtis Sittenfeld’s irresistible novel, Romantic Comedy) allegedly continue at NBC’s Saturday Night Live, the late-night sketch comedy show that has been around for almost half a century, and elsewhere.\\n Some of her sources allow her to use their names; others choose to remain anonymous whistleblowers, fearful of the consequences for their careers if they become known as troublemakers. She manages to get a few of those accused – “the sinister forces in the shadows” – to go on the record with their responses, but most ignored her requests for interview.\\n Stories abound of nightmare situations arising in writers’ rooms, on sets and in private offices, around racism, sexism, homophobia, inequitable returns for efforts, and the systemic abuse of those without power. Ryan’s crusader-like passion sometimes leads to overkill, the litany of sins that she uncovers providing more examples than required to make her points when a more selective approach would have been more effective.\\n But it does mean that many of those that the system has turned into victims do get an opportunity to have their voices heard, even if only as “Joyce” or “Hannah”, or any of the other names she attaches to those who wish to avoid reprisal.\\n Ryan is especially illuminating in her examination of some of the disturbing developments at Saturday Night Live. In this context, she cites journalist Seth Simons’ astute but unfashionable notion that stand-up comedians have long occupied a space for an ugly culture, one “where it has been OK to be a horrible person” (a point that becomes especially pertinent in the light of the coverage of Russell Brand’s transgressions).\\n In the final section of the book, acknowledging that there’s no magic fix for the problems she’s identified, Ryan proposes several ways in which it might be possible to repair “the damage created by allowing toxic people – and systems – to run amok”.\\n She quotes The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer about the best way to go about it: “The hope for a more equitable, democratic and prosperous society does not lie with enlightened corporations but with organised workers.” And, in line with this, she points to the need for writers, actors and others to work together to establish grassroots alliances and respectful workplaces in which to do their creative work.\\n She ends by explaining that she’s no revolutionary, that she doesn’t actually want to burn Hollywood down. What she really wants is a business equivalent of a “prescribed burn”, one that can help prevent a wildfire. “Fire can be rejuvenating,” she writes, creating a neat analogy courtesy of National Geographic. “It returns nutrients to the soil … and can help young trees and other plants start to grow.”\\n Burn It Down sometimes labours its points, but the urgency with which Ryan champions her cause is both affecting and effective.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'Australia’s top chief executives almost unanimously expect the domestic economy to skirt a recession next year despite lingering inflation, pressure on household budgets and the prospect of a long monetary pause.\\n CEOs from the banking, mining, retail, property and industrials sectors expect Australia’s economy to slow in the coming year, which along with cost pressures could mean a tougher 2024 for business and pressure on planned investment.\\n “We’re likely to avoid a hard landing in 2024,” Goodman Group founder and CEO Greg Goodman said.\\n “It’s also likely that inflation will keep slowing as a result of the interest rate rises we’ve seen. The business climate is, however, going to be more difficult, with spending more subdued.”\\n Macquarie Group’s Shemara Wikramanayake said Australia’s immigration profile and strength in key industries should keep the country out of recession in 2024; however, slower economic growth should bring inflation back to the Reserve Bank’s targeted range by the end of the year.\\n “Broad-based inflationary pressures, driven by relatively strong economic demand and a tight labour market, will likely abate in the face of this slower growth,” Ms Wikramanayake said.\\n Commonwealth Bank boss Matt Comyn said there was only low risk of a recession next year, although that would increase should high inflation persist and the RBA needed to increase official interest rates further.\\n “Given the sharp rise in interest rates over the past 18 months, we think we are at, or very close to, the top of the current rate cycle,” Mr Comyn said.\\n The comments were made as part of The Australian Financial Review’s annual Chanticleer survey of more than 50 top ASX CEOs. Nearly all said higher interest rates and inflation were likely to slow growth; however, they pointed to immigration and infrastructure spending as reasons why Australia would avoid a recession.\\n Wesfarmers CEO Rob Scott said the homegrown cost pressures, including staff costs and raw materials, were the “greatest challenge to inflation” in the coming year.\\n “We are seeing significant increases in supply chain costs, wages, power and other services,” said Mr Scott, whose company owns hardware retailer Bunnings Warehouse, discount retailer Kmart and a big industrials chemicals business.\\n “There are risks of further pressures in 2024 with additional regulation and compliance costs, and less flexibility in the workplace to adjust to dynamic changes in the market will ultimately increase costs if we are not careful.”\\n CEOs with consumer-facing businesses said cost-of-living pressures would keep customers rethinking their spending habits and choices. Even so, they kept referring to the economy as “resilient”.\\n “I think most people have been surprised at how resilient the economy has been this year in spite of global shocks and interest rate hikes, so we’re cautiously optimistic that resilience continues,” said Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson, who took over from Alan Joyce in September.\\n “What we’re seeing is that demand across Jetstar and Qantas remains above pre-COVID levels, despite cost-of-living pressures.”\\n Coles CEO Leah Weckert, also new to her role, agreed customers were feeling the fiscal pinch: “Overall, we are optimistic about the resilience of the Australian economy and, in particular, non-discretionary sectors like supermarkets,” she said.\\n Woolworths’ Brad Banducci was reluctant to make any economic predictions, but said the government’s revised approach to skilled migration had helped address labour shortages that should ease cost pressures in the economy.\\n “It will allow Australia to better attract the talent we need to fill critical skills gaps and labour shortages across the economy, in turn supporting productivity growth,” Mr Banducci said.\\n “The ‘Skills In Demand’ visa is a big step forward and will help bring experts with emerging skills and expertise into Australia to help train and develop local team members.”\\n Elliott Rusanow, who runs Westfield owner Scentre Group and is a major landlord to the likes of Coles and Woolworths, said consumers were still spending up big at the shops.\\n “When you look at the consumer, aggregate consumer spending is also high,” Mr Rusanow said. “We’re seeing this play out in our business partner sales which are at record levels.”\\n Seven Group’s Ryan Stokes was one of only a few outliers who said there was a “high risk” of a hard economic landing and there was little room for further interest rate tightening.\\n “The resilience shown to date can only withstand so many shocks inflicted by the RBA,” Mr Stokes said.\\n “The RBA’s approach to the cash rate will eventually trigger the economic contraction they are targeting ... In short, rates have already moved too far too quickly. Patience needs to be demonstrated. Further rate increases are not required in the near term.”\\n Newmont CEO Tom Palmer, an Australian whose company bought Australia’s biggest listed goldminer Newcrest Mining this year, said it was too early to declare victory in the fight against inflation.\\n “Until there is a sustained and honest effort to increase productivity in Australia through genuine reform, the RBA has little option but to use the blunt instrument of cash rate increases to try and reduce inflation,” Mr Palmer said.\\n With Ciara Seccombe and Edmund Tadros\\n'},\n",

       "  'headline': 'The novel tackling the myth of Australia’s ‘bloodless’ creation',\n",
       "  'description': 'FICTION\\nEdenglassie\\nMelissa Lucashenko\\nUniversity of Queensland Press, $32.99\\n When I was at high school in northern NSW, in a town just south of the Queensland border, one of my teachers reflected on the remarkable fact that Australia was founded as a modern country without major bloodshed. Melissa Lucashenko’s electrifying new novel draws on recent research suggesting that “There were more dead on the Queensland frontier than Aussies killed in World War One”, making notions of Australia’s’ “peaceful” history now seem almost wilfully blind.\\n Lucashenko’s title is a portmanteau of Edinburgh and Glasgow, and was the name given to the penal colony that became Brisbane. Edenglassie opens in 2024, whenan ageing Aboriginal woman, Eddie, takes a fall and lands herself in hospital. Sceptical of the medical profession, given the history of her mistreatment by authorities, Lucashenko tells us, “she had been concerned with dirt all her life, and with being dispossessed of the same, not to mention treated like dirt, which is to say, trampled over and disregarded as a general rule”.\\n While in hospital, she is attended-to by Doctor Johnny, who has recently learned via DNA testing of his Indigenous ancestry, but Eddie’s granddaughter, the plain-speaking Winona, is quick to scuttle any idea that he can identify as Indigenous, without a thorough cultural education. Winona is something of a firebrand for Indigenous rights; in one particularly amusing incident, Winona confiscates the didgeridoo of a busking white man and wields it as a weapon against him.\\n In a second narrative strand set in the mid-1800s, we learn about Mulanyin, who belongs “to the five Yugembeh rivers which fell like wide blue ribbons from the western range”. Travelling with his law-brother Murree, Mulanyin encounters Nita. Nita was “rescued” from slavery by the Petrie family, working as a maid, but ultimately taken on as the family’s ward (though she continues to provide their domestic labour.)\\n The love affair between Nita and Mulanyin, as well as the depiction of kinship, shows the intimate ties these characters have to the land, defining not only their culture but notions of selfhood. In one scene, Mulanyin attempts to fish a female mulloway, but is directed by his elders to return it to the sea. Mulanyin then has “the electric realisation that all his life he had been eating the decisions of his ancestors”.\\n Edenglassie shows etiquette and respect as central to the Indigenous way of life, belying prevailing colonial attitudes. Mulanyin observes that a young Yugambeh boy was “quite rude not to stop and yarn”.\\n In 2024, Eddie encounters a presence in her hospital room, masterfully named by Lucashenko as “the Voice”. The omniscient narrator in Edenglassie serves Lucashenko particularly well, hovering between characters, enacting with nuance a variety of Indigenous perspectives: the moderate Eddie, who is more ready to reconcile herself to a peaceful solution, and Winona, who is understandably angry on behalf of her people.\\n Eddie explains to Winona at one point that the Petries’ son Tom was actually initiated, and thus “part of the tribe”, explaining that “things could have been different alright. If the whitefellas had just asked.” Throughout Edenglassie, the hope offered by Lucashenko, who won the Miles Franklin award in 2019 for Too Much Lip, is that despite the various injustices meted out by white settlers, understanding across cultural boundaries remains nonetheless possible through communication and respect.\\n In the earlier time-stream, the oppression of Indigenous people is extreme: we learn about a curfew announced by the cracking of a “stockwhip”. In an unforgettable scene, Lucashenko enacts the execution of Dundalli, an Indigenous warrior and resistance fighter whose death was horribly botched. At one point we learn that “the Kurilpa and Magandjin had been rudely shoved back from their river, often at gunpoint”.\\n Even the well-meaning Dr Johnny unwittingly commits a number of faux pas. When he points out a plaque in Brisbane, acknowledging an Indigenous warrior named Mulrobin, Winona derides this as tokenistic given Indigenous people have had to fight for every minor gain, which for her and her family has been “exhausting”. Dr Johnny also doubts the presence of the Voice and considers it a manifestation of Eddie’s cognitive decline, but to Indigenous characters this ancestral presence is very real.\\n Given the historical research Lucashenko deploys here, it’s not surprising that Mulanyin’s story involves a shocking brutality, and the depiction of the events of Mulanyin’s life are only made more poignant by the story of his love for the land, particularly the “saltwater”, and his palpable connection to kin.\\n It is through the dual time streams that Lucashenko emphasises the importance of truth-telling to contemporary Indigenous Australians. Eddie needs the truth to be recounted and acknowledged so that these past injustices may be healed, and the lack of truth is hauntingly evoked by Lucashenko as a profound absence.\\n Lucashenko’s meticulously researched novel speaks to a deep-seated violence not just in the past, but in the way our colonial history continues to be represented. Edenglassie forms part of an essential conversation about our shared heritage; its urgent and modest request is that we listen.\\n Gretchen Shirm’s latest novel, The Crying Room, is published by Transit Lounge.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'Disney may be better known for its theme parks and blockbuster movies, but its streaming service successfully draws on a pair of historic America television networks, spin-offs from its fabled franchises, and a growing cohort of original commissions. Putting together the platform’s essential scripted shows required difficult choices, but the list is illustrious.\\n Abbott Elementary\\nThe great American sitcom is not dead, it’s just morphed into this delightfully witty mockumentary about the ever-burdened staff at a primary school in West Philadelphia. Creator and star Quinta Brunson delivers 22-minute episodes that sing with character humour and absurd machinations. Janella James, as the school’s questionable principal, is the best scene-stealer on television right now.\\n The Americans\\nWhat began as a sharp Cold War thriller, following a pair of Russian spies (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) living as a couple complete with children in Washington DC, became a masterful study of what we will and won’t reveal to those closest to us. Deception has rarely been so intensely intimate, culminating in a note-perfect finale after six seasons.\\n Andor\\nThe rough equation is Star Wars with less Jedi and more John le Carre, but that doesn’t do justice to Tony Gilroy’s brilliant prequel series about how the dedicated spy from 2016’s Rogue One movie (Diego Luna), found his calling as a revolutionary. Dispensing with nostalgia but staging gripping set-pieces, this is a galaxy far, far away reimagined for adults.\\n Arrested Development\\nIgnore the subsequent Netflix revival, the original three seasons of this wonderfully loopy comedy about a dysfunctional family’s downfall constitute one of the funniest shows of this century. Jason Bateman is the dutiful son trying to hold everything together, but he’s surrounded by self-sabotaging kin whose antics are perfectly shaped by dry digressions, meta-commentary, and brain-bending ramifications.\\n Atlanta\\nDonald Glover’s surrealist-tinged comedy about a struggling college graduate (Glover) who works as the manager of his rapper cousin (an immense Brian Tyree Henry) was one of the most ambitious shows television has witnessed, and mostly it succeeded. The implications of being Black in America spiralled into uncomfortable realities, otherworldly horror, and soulful self-recognition.\\n The Bear\\n”Yes, chef!” A blackly comic drama about a fine dining savant (Jeremy Allen White) returning to run his late brother’s Chicago sandwich joint, the two seasons to date of this series have been defined by corrosive tension, whiplash humour, and family dynamics that are painfully gripping. Watching creativity and renewal take hold for these characters is both a blessing and a curse.\\n Bob’s Burgers\\nIt took a season to get going but Loren Bouchard’s animated sitcom about the family behind a New Jersey burger joint has become one of television’s enduring pleasures. The Belcher clan are a wonderful mix of characters, driving a winning sense of humour that eschews pop-culture references for a depiction of the everyday that is charmingly plausible.\\n Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\nThe original slay queen, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Geller) is a Californian high school student chosen to battle the forces of evil. It’s the first of many inspired mash-ups in this deeply influential supernatural adventure, which shines as a tale of feminist empowerment, a goofy serial, and a homage to friendship powered by rat-a-tat dialogue.\\n Desperate Housewives\\nIs it a soap opera or a satire of a soap opera? Marc Cherry’s blockbuster comedy about the many intrigues surrounding a group of neighbouring married women was both and much more. Upending how network television depicted wives, life on Wisteria Lane was wild, insightful, and given to almighty twists.\\n Homeland\\nEpisodic television has rarely seen a performance as fierce and finely judged as the one Claire Danes delivers in this spy drama, playing an obsessive CIA agent with bipolar disorder. The early seasons, with Damian Lewis as a possible foe hiding in plain sight, are a sinewy two-hander, before Danes’ Carrie Mathison becomes the focus of a taut, globe-trotting study of betrayal and sacrifice.\\n How I Met Your Mother\\nIf you crave the reassuring familiarity of a multi-camera studio sitcom, the nine seasons of this Hollywood comedy about the loves and laughs of a group of (initially) twentysomethings will hit the spot. The punchlines are sharp but the casting is perfect: Jason Segel, Cobie Smulders, Alyson Hannigan, and a fearless Neil Patrick Harris shine.\\n Loki\\nThe one television spin-off of Marvel’s movie blockbusters that mattered follows the titular brother of Thor, Tom Hiddleston’s capricious, arrogant Loki, who finds himself caught up with the agency regulating time itself and its representative, Owen Wilson’s laconic investigator. The unlikely duo’s double act is the show’s selling point, a give and take that is verbally dexterous and emotionally primed.\\n Lost\\nThe network drama that didn’t so much kick the door in for grandiose ambitions as knock the entire house down, the 121 episodes of this science-fiction laced epic gave us smoke monsters, temporal shifts, labyrinthine conspiracies and a handful of finely revealed characters. The mysterious island they were trapped on was a puzzle box of vast possibility, somehow kept in motion through six seasons.\\n Mrs America\\nCate Blanchett, Rose Byrne, and Uzo Aduba headline an exemplary cast in this historical drama about the 1970s battle in America between second-wave feminists and the conservative women who opposed them. This is a vivid, telling recreation, with depictions of real-life figures that are anything but textbook – these public and private conflicts are both nuanced and prescient.\\n The Muppet Show\\nAs the oldest show on this list – it ran between 1976 and 1981 – there are certainly dips in Jim Henson’s ground-breaking reinvention of the variety show, but Kermit, Miss Piggy, and their iconic fellow hand puppets thoroughly transcend the era. The best guests gave the backstage absurdity an artful, idiosyncratic charge, with guests like Elton John, Gilda Radner, and John Cleese.\\n NYPD Blue\\nControversial when it debuted in 1993, Steven Bochco and David Milch’s police procedural about a fictional Manhattan precinct raised the bar for the cop drama with intertwining storylines, pungent dialogue, and reflections on trauma. David Caruso ducked out after one season, but the pairing of Jimmy Smits and Dennis Franz gave the show a memorable core that carried it to classic status.\\n One Mississippi\\nDebuting in 2015 and unfairly cancelled after just two seasons, comedian Tig Notaro’s semi-autobiographical series has her playing a breast cancer patient who returns to her hometown to care for her dying mother. The observational comedy that ensures is deeply personal, heartbreaking in its misunderstandings, and willing to suspend reality to grasp deeper truths. This hidden gem is ripe for rediscovery.\\n Only Murders in the Building\\nSteve Martin, Selena Gomez, and Martin Short are aces together in this farcical crime caper about a trio of true crime podcast addicts who start recording when a neighbour in their NYC apartment block is murdered. It’s a rapid-fire satire and deadpan comedy of manners, but its secret weapon is a melancholic undertow that makes the motives tragic and the investigators dedicated to their unlikely friendship.\\n The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\\nThe murder trial that transfixed America 30 years ago is re-examined in a limited series that reveals the distorting nature of fame, rampant ego, and sexist double standards. In an all-star cast none surpass Courtney B. Vance as defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran: a showman created by the very system he despises.\\n Pose\\nBoisterous with a bittersweet chaser, this drama recreates in stunning detail the ball subculture in 1980s New York, where Black and Latino drag queens competed for recognition in private tournaments while representing their unofficial families. It’s hectic and not always subtle, but the show does what its historic subjects did: it claims space for the marginalised and lets their stories resonate.\\n Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.

       "  'description': 'This wrap of shows across the Melbourne International Comedy Festival includes “a ripper of a show”, a performer who is surely a lock for best newcomer, a show in progress from the greatest comedian of his generation, a tropical holiday (sort of), a promising sketch performer, one of the best mental health jokes of the festival so far, stories of amorous kangaroos, an extremely impressive debut and plenty more.\\n COMEDY\\nGillian Cosgriff | Actually Good ★★★★½\\nThe Butterfly Club, until April 23\\n A lockdown-themed show of sorts may seem unfashionable in 2023, but not in the deft hands of Gillian Cosgriff, returning to the comedy festival for the first time since 2018 – mostly because it functions as a mere frame to explore what’s actually good in life. Each night, Cosgriff solicits her audience to find out their top 10 likes – all of which she notes down in a self-professed “book of tiny delights”.\\n Interspersed with this gentle form of audience participation are humorous anecdotes and highly infectious, clever, original songs that Cosgriff belts out about her own likes while her hands move across her keyboard at a dizzying pace. Cosgriff’s a whip-smart, quick-witted, confident performer.\\n It becomes clear towards the end that what undergirds the show is a simultaneous sense of sorrow and joy – it’s a credit to Cosgriff that she can hold space for both, leaving audiences with an incredibly affirming (and funny) show that marvels in the tiny profundities that make up our lives.\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n COMEDY\\nPatrick Golamco | Pork Adobo\\nTrades Hall, until April 23\\n Patrick Golamco is surely a lock for a Best Newcomer nomination this festival.\\n Having come runner-up in the 2021 RAW Comedy National Grand Final, and storming Comedy Zone in 2022, his debut Melbourne solo show is loosely tied together by a story of visiting his 99-year-old grandmother in Manila to let her know he loves her while she may be on her deathbed.\\n Through song, breakneck-speed jokes and tales of therapy gone awry, he harnesses the neurotic, introverted nature of Luke McGregor, the shake-your-head puns of Tim Vine and the pull-the-rug-from-your-feet energy of Mitch Hedberg all at once.\\n There are sharp jabs at Catholics, his Chinese upbringing, and of course, tales of the titular recipe – all which are delivered with the aplomb of a festival veteran.\\n At only 40 minutes in length it’s on the leaner side of shows this year. But for those who prefer quality over quantity, you simply can’t miss it.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nComedy Zone\\nTrades Hall, until April 23\\n A five-dish taster, the hand-picked lineup of Comedy Zone decided by festival staff is a glimpse of the future stars of Australian comedy.\\n Hosted by AJ Lamarque, he turned the camp up to a degree that would make Joel Creasey blush with stories of coming out and being mixed-race. Ben Hunter shared his love of playing goal defence in netball and hesitation to hang out his clothes; Samuel Gebreselassie delivered deeply dark material of why Ethiopia is now famous for aviation disasters rather than famine; and Annie Boyle’s delivery was so dry that it left the audience parched. That said, a brilliantly employed dance move quenched the thirst in mere moments.\\n Alexandra Hudson delivered the strongest set of the evening honing in on her disabilities. However, 80% of her material was verbatim from her televised RAW Comedy-winning performance last year. If you’re yet to see it – don’t until after the show.\\n A well-rounded evening, but not as strong as previous years.\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nDaniel Kitson | I Shall Have a Good Think When Everybody’s Gone Home\\nMalthouse Theatre, until April 23\\n If you know, you know.\\n In 2002, Daniel Kitson took home the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 2007, he won the top gong at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. If the rules allowed you to win more than once, he’d have another half-dozen on his mantelpiece.\\n Make no mistake – Kitson is the greatest comedian of his generation. Even if his aversion to press, media and podcasts means the majority have never heard of him. When other comedians see him perform, often they consider quitting the art form, knowing that they’ll never reach the same heights. It’s known as a term within the cognoscenti as “the Kitson effect”.\\n Does this all sound sycophantic? Probably. But is it hyperbole? Absolutely not.\\n A poll conducted by Dave, a TV channel that is a subsidiary of BBC, saw British comics including the ilk of Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee, Tim Vine, Mark Watson, Jason Byrne and Greg Davies all agreeing that he reigned supreme.\\n The sold-out audience for the stuttering Brit’s latest 90-minute show at 12pm on a Sunday is filled to the brim with other award-winning comics from the festival watching on.\\n The show is a masterclass of delivery, quips and callbacks. Be it comparing his own work to a pavlova, keeping an audience member as a time-keeper or heartbreakingly cutting observations on the human condition – he’s armed with a vocabulary and wit that could rival Shakespeare.\\n All are delivered with rapid-fire articulation and multi-layered gags – and the interspersed crowd-work and reactionary exchanges are phenomenal.\\n Melbourne has long been his testing ground. If this is what he’s calling (read: deliberately underselling) as a work in progress, it’s near impossible to think how good the final product will be.\\n This is stand-up at its very finest. All for a measly $20.\\n Book yesterday, thrice.\\n Then you’ll know.\\n★★★★½\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n CABARET\\nAlice Tovey | Not Like the Other Ghouls\\nMalthouse – The Tower, until April 9\\n Channelling the wounded rage of Carrie, doused in pig blood, and the extreme camp of Courteney Cox’s absurd fringe in Scream 3, Alice Tovey, in a Ghostface leather corset dress, is not having a good night.\\n Playing a version of herself that’s hosting a spooktacular dinner theatre show at Frankenstein’s Palace, she has to cope with headliners dying en route. Now a meta one-woman show, Tovey stitches her generously vulnerable cabaret into a musical ode to teenage years of self-doubt, when she sought refuge in the queer otherness of horror movies.\\n Tovey’s mum pulled her out of school to read Twilight finale Breaking Dawn, after all, and she was just as much into mopey vampire boyfriends \\xadas fight-back final girls. But just who is that demanding, discombobulated voice in her head that sounds a lot like a Aussie Hollywood A-lister? There’s a lot going on here, and it’s all ghoulishly good.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nScout Boxall | Turbo Lover\\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 23\\n Scout Boxall is what happens if you’re raised on a diet of educational media, including the nightly news, Oregon Trail, the history channel, and Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing: an adult with a true crime and conspiracy theory obsession – one not killed off by working for five years as a court reporter.\\n Who doesn’t love conspiracy theories and true crime? Not this audience, who are thrilled to banter about their favourites and hear about Boxall’s.\\n This night was heavy on audience interaction. Boxall managed to take even the most banal responses and weave magic.\\n Turbo Lover is broadly about romance and love which Boxall claims are a mystery to them, but their material about being a non-binary bisexual finds favour with the crowd that loves it all, from the relateable to the risqué.\\n Their take on this universal material provides weird and wonderful truisms you can’t imagine any other performer pulling off.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY & THEATRE\\nLou Wall | vs. The Internet\\nACMI, until April 9\\n At six foot four, dripping Y2K vibes and geometrically precise braids, Lou Wall could be the Eureka Tower of Melbourne comedy. If only our architecture was as weird, queer and extremely online.\\n Of course this country kid was denied the internet until their mid-teens. Who else could nail the sorry-not-sorry ambivalence we all feel towards digital life? Wall’s envy of a schoolmate was turbo-charged by social media, but this is theatre, not therapy, and that jealous energy fuels a 120bpm multimedia onslaught that refuses to settle into any one genre, tone or voice.\\n Example: an early bit about an innocent Insta post seamlessly shifts into a hilarious exchange with an online foot fetishist that again morphs into a Lizzo-esque musical number as wrong as the whole thing is real.\\n The show’s Shyamalan-level twist ending proves that for all its high-wire lunacy, Wall is as sure-footed as they come.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by John Bailey\\n COMEDY\\nLaura Davis | Well Don’t Just Stand There Dancing\\nCampari House, until April 23\\n “If you’ve seen me before, I’ve changed,” says Laura Davis standing before us in pale chinos, denim shirt, red kerchief, and wide-brimmed hat. It’s not just the outfit.\\n Since last performing in Melbourne, Davis has been altered, as many of us have, by a pandemic and the curveballs of this new world we live in. Things are less predictable, more disorienting. Alarming things happen.\\n With a hectic pace, Davis veers between topics as varied as Jurassic Park, collecting rocks, and dispatching spiders, dropping in and out of character while delivering laughs that seem only tangentially related. It’s anarchic and the audience is with her all the way.\\n As the show unfolds, unravels, tangles, untangles and turns back on itself, we are brought full circle and Davis’ skill at weaving a story you didn’t know you were being told is unveiled. It’s remarkable and gratifying in equal measure.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nClara Cupcakes | Yee Howdy Rides Again\\nMalthouse Theatre, Playbox, until April 9\\n With looks like American drag queen Trixie Mattel and zany humour like Lucille Ball, Clara Cupcakes’ Yee Howdy Rides Again is a knee-slapping good time.\\n Dressed in a red hat, pink plaid shirt, denim shorts, cow-print boots, dark leather holster with a banana, then topped off with a bolo tie fastened with a cupcake slide, this camp one-woman show is a theatre western riding high on its theme.\\n The production incorporates a cardboard cactus called “Clara Cactus Face”, animated projector fire, elaborate costumes and whiplash sound effects, transporting audiences on a thrilling adventure that uses patriarchal cowboy culture and “cowpitalism” as a metaphor for feminist ideals.\\n Cupcakes is a versatile performer, transitioning between clowning, burlesque, improvisation, song and mime, adapting to sound and prop mishaps without faltering. Reliance on audience participation is always a risk, but Cupcakes’ guided cues enable a comfortable interaction.\\n So, giddy up! You’re in for a wild ride.\\n★★★★½\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nJames Nokise\\nCampari House, until April 23\\n One performer, one microphone, and one hour of straight stand-up resulting in sore cheeks for the audience. This is a ripper of a show.\\n Nokise, eponymous fancy man, makes it look easy as he freewheels between tales about himself, his Samoan family and his home country of Aotearoa (New Zealand) as only a performer with this level of skill can do. These deeply personal stories demonstrate a remarkable ability to draw the political from the personal in a way that avoids proselytising and endears him to the audience.\\n In his home country, he is known not only as a brilliant stand-up but as the host of mental health podcast Eating Fried Chicken in the Shower. His material about this potentially difficult topic is empathetic, well-handled and, yes, funny. No small feat.\\n Nokise’s years of experience delivering award-winning performances are evident in his comfort on stage and disarmingly charming delivery. A delight.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY & CABARET\\nMel & Sam | High Pony\\nThe Toff at Curtin House, until April 12\\n A line of purple netball bibs strung against the back curtain sets the scene for a show-stopping introductory song-and-dance number about sports culture.\\n Award-winning performers and podcast hosts Samantha Andrew and Mel O’Brien deliver a high-energy, seamless cabaret show with non-stop laughs that’ll make your cheeks hurt. Dressed in ’90s girl band-inspired outfits with high ponytails, black midriff halter necks, flared black and neon pants and bright eye shadow, they deliver musical hit after hit that has the audience in fits of laughter.\\n Featuring tunes about Where’s Wally, babies being cancelled and lesbians not getting “the ick”, they hilariously mock queer stereotypes from their own perspectives and experiences. Swift and simple costume changes also ensure limited respite from the lols.\\n A fitting sequel to Shit-Wrecked! (2022 MICF), Andrew and O’Brien have great on-stage synchronicity, chemistry and banter.\\n A chart-topping parody pop duo in the making.\\n★★★★★\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nDiana Nguyen | Going All In\\nMelbourne Town Hall – The Flag Room, until April 23\\n Stereotypes harm us all, but the joyous Diana Nguyen is empowered – thanks to expensive breathing classes and an extensive range of dildos – to reclaim the “Asians can’t swim” slur.\\n She’s leapt headlong into roiling oceans to feign surfing proficiency to net not one, but two boyfriends (at separate times), all while being a prime candidate for Bondi Rescue who can’t float in a swimming pool. Often snort-laughing at her own (saucy) jokes, Nguyen is a hoot who can sweep even the most blush-prone audience into her silliness.\\n If the show’s a bit loose, it all hangs (10) together in the end, with a powerful undercurrent beneath the surface of this generous-hearted hilarity. A trigger warning that there will be intergenerational trauma content washes up in the final lap, as the threads of family and the indomitable spirit of her Vietnamese mum, who came to Melbourne as a refugee, leave you beaming.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nBrendan Wan | Yummy Yummy Cha Cha!\\nTIC Swanston (The Nicholas Building), until April 9\\n Brendan Wan isn’t interested in dissecting the Chinese-Australian migrant experience in his debut solo sketch comedy show – and fair enough. There are plenty of comedians who do just that.\\n His interests lie more in the realm of the absurd and surreal, manifesting in the 10-plus sketches that make up his high-energy, hour-long show.\\n A member of the Chinese crime syndicate Hutong Dragons delivers a presentation on how the group can make themselves more inclusive (a definite standout of the show that has the audience in stitches). A rendition of a perennial favourite karaoke song goes wrong. Appearances by Wan’s “stuntman” Rusty Lopez are another highlight – his spot-on impersonation of a certain Australian comedic trio is so startlingly accurate, it elicits uproarious laughter.\\n The punchlines of many of Wan’s sketches are in the set-up, but certain premises feel underdeveloped and go on for too long. However, as a debut comedy show it shows promise – Wan is a sketch comedian to watch.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n COMEDY\\nLuke Heggie | Grot\\nMorris House, until April 23\\n “This country’s built on theft,” quips Luke Heggie, positioning himself as an anti-left, anti-right, no-BS anthropological commentator who has a few things to get off his angry chest.\\n There is no knowing wink. No applause breaks. No sip of water.\\n Grot is line after line of lacerating truth about this ridiculous, ugly and (sure) lucky country we inhabit. Following last year’s magnum opus, Lowbreed, Heggie’s new set is another scathing critique on Australia’s class system, face-palm hypocrisy and the way we’ve veered into an era where the most flexible people in the country – those who do yoga etc – “are also the most useless”.\\n The crowd were in hysterics at what a mental health day really is (I won’t spoil it) and, apart from a spotty bit on Indonesia (which will be ironed out across the 42 performances he’s doing), this is a perfect hour of sharp, slaying-them-in-the-aisles, stand-up comedy.\\n Surely, an early contender for most outstanding show of the festival.\\n★★★★½\\nReviewed by Mikey Cahill\\n COMEDY\\nStephen Hall | Letters From My Heroes\\nACMI, until April 23\\n Never meet your heroes. Or in Stephen Hall’s case, never write to them.\\n Over 50 minutes, Hall reads the fictitious responses from celebrities that he has reached out to for advice: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jack Nicholson, Rodney Rude, Billy Connolly and a host of deceased names – Thomas Edison, Sean Connery.\\n It’s a flimsy concept at best. At its worst, it’s nothing more than an excuse for Hall to deliver an abundance of impressions.\\n Ironically, the strongest moment of the show highlights its weaknesses – when Hall screens a real impromptu vox pop with his father who abandoned his family during his childhood. It’s a bittersweet moment of sincerity that no impression could ever match.\\n While his ability to manipulate his voice is impressive, those hoping to witness the type of satirical whiplash that he’s previously delivered on arguably Australia’s best comedy of the past decade (Mad As Hell) will be left underwhelmed.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nAnne Edmonds | Why Is My Bag All Wet?\\nComedy Theatre, until April 23\\n All it took was an apocalypse for Helen Bidou’s real-life alter-ego to capture her Welsh boyfriend.\\n When lockdowns lifted, she held onto him the good old-fashioned way: by getting pregnant. Her words, not mine, in a riotous hour of “I’m a mum now, can you believe it?” that sees the award-winning comedian reach heights almost as delirious as her Get Krack!n counterpart, including a lesson in how best to slouch down a wall drunk.\\n She’ll whip you from doom-scrolling Facebook Marketplace through to sequestering a defective high-chair from a troll coven in Edinburgh, and on to a regrettable incident in a two-storey Coles Local in the NSW capital that has her pondering why they don’t just drain the harbour for more real estate?\\n If new motherhood isn’t the freshest show idea, then Edmond’s hurricane-force edge-of-hysteria humour sells it, delivering the kind of high you get from the good drugs in hospital.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nChloe Petts, Rob Auton, Huge Davies | New Order\\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 23\\n New Order brings three of the UK’s newest, most original and best unknown-to-Australia comedians to the festival.\\n Chloe Petts delivers the most straightforward set of the trio, opening the night describing the joys of being a masculine lesbian in self-deprecating fashion. Having good-naturedly made herself a target, she then turns her attention towards the English-Australian relationship, sports fans, and bantering with the frankly odd audience.\\n Rob Auton has a lackadaisical presence, dispensing observational material with a side-serving of the absurd. Add in a dash of poetry combining melancholy and humour, and you have a unique fusion that leaves the audience pleasurably baffled.\\n Huge Davies ends the night with deadpan delivery and a keyboard that he wields to deliver musical comedy and comedy about music, both of which have a delicious dark streak.\\n With 15-20 minutes per performer, the material is tight and the variety proves a strength.\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nSam Campbell | Every Single Emotion\\nMax Watt’s, until April 23\\n Sydney crackpot Sam Campbell is on a tear.\\n In the past five years he’s scaled the highest heights in comedy by winning the top gongs at Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2018 and last year’s Edinburgh Fringe.\\n Every Single Emotion is not so much a return to earth as a madcap hour of swerving, unnerving LOLs that needs lots of tightening up but is still undeniably Cambo (read: utterly brilliant, constantly wrong-footing and spectacular value for money).\\n Playing his biggest room yet, Campbell’s demonic voice modifier and extra shouty approach engage the crowd well.\\n A mid-show cameo from a fellow comic lands nicely as he bags out The Hundred with Andy Lee and professes a desire to be on another more successful panel show. Just imagine.\\n He’s on fire when he riffs on Jason Statham’s culinary skills and Christian O’Connell’s odd level of fame, while a Pet Barn bit needs to be neutered. Wait for his call-back to The Three Ls – it’s classic Campbell, where you think everything has gone pear-shaped but in fact it’s all cool bananas.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Mikey Cahill\\n COMEDY\\nKirsty Webeck | A Bit of Fun\\nThe Westin Three, until April 23\\n If you’ve accidentally been hoodwinked into going to the ballet by anyone pulling the “fun voice”, the last thing you’ll want to do is squish into a pair of tights, get up on stage and perform a pas de deux.\\n Kirsty (never Kristy, maaaybe Kransky) knows this, and that Swan Lake is too long. So if you love short and snappy comedy gigs with a great deal of heart but are terrified of audience participation, relax, you’re in safe hands.\\n An animal farm of content, from shocking rat attacks to the unfortunate fate of sperm whales, unfolds. Webeck’s obsessed with naming our furry friends and will take it personally if you don’t let her, even if it’s your second birthday (firsts are just dumb). There are busloads of LOLs to be had in a show that, unlike the ballet, isn’t flashy but will leave you wheeze-laughing a great deal more.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nDane Simpson\\nComedy Republic, until April 10\\n Dane Simpson named his show Always Was, Always Will Be…Funny on a whim, but it’s easy to imagine the funny kid he was when watching the cheeky, likeable performer he is now.\\n The show centres on Simpson’s recent life experiences and relationships, and his material remains personal even when it explores the more political aspects of life as a Gamilaraay man.\\n He sometimes uses short videos and pictures to help illustrate his material, but this is essentially a classic stand-up show with wordplay, callbacks and quippy one-liners in between longer stories.\\n He isn’t the only funny one in his family, and his delight in sharing their antics is contagious. Simpson appears to be having as much fun as the audience as he giggles at his own jokes, inviting the room to laugh along with him.\\n His personable delivery creates a natural rapport that results in steady laughter and applause.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nLucinda Price and Louis Hanson | Besties\\nTrades Hall – Solidarity Hall (show’s run is now complete)\\n Besties is an intimate slumber party filled with storytelling, confessions, witty banter and deliberately dorky singing and dancing.\\n Originally from Melbourne, comedians and creators Lucinda Price and Louis Hanson return home to a loving audience of social media fans, childhood friends and family. Dressed in Hello Kitty pyjamas, Price and Hanson get vulnerable, sharing parts of themselves yet to be disclosed – even on their respective Instagram and TikTok accounts. Price’s divulgence about a sexual encounter with an unnamed celebrity will leave audiences googling on the trip home.\\n From footage of embarrassing gigs to a fake image with an ex’s ex, their wizardry in video editing and Photoshop adds a meme aspect to the show, representative of their work at Pedestrian TV and as online personalities.\\n Witnessing Price and Hanson’s close-knit kinship feels like a warm hug, inviting the audience into a three-way call that you never want to end.\\n★★★★★\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nNina Oyama and Jude Perl | We Should Hang Out!\\nThe Westin Three, March 31 (show’s run is now complete)\\n Six comedians, one hour. What better way to spend three nights at the comedy festival? (n.b. this show’s run ended on April 1).\\n Nina Oyama, with her effortless charm and affable on-stage persona, and Jude Perl, with her virtuosic combination of dark humour, remarkable keyboard skills and a killer voice to match, are the hosts of a “loose and live” late-night variety show – featuring four comedic acts as divergent in their styles as their hosts are.\\n The jokes come a mile a minute in Suren Jayemanne’s confident set, spanning topics as varied as gentrification, rescue dogs and accents. Heath Franklin has the crowd on edge by deliberately wading into taboo territory, but subverts expectations in surprising ways. Aurelia St Clair’s languid, ASMR-pleasing delivery is responsible for perhaps one of the best mental health jokes of the festival thus far. And rounding it out is Frankie McNair as the sultry, chain-smoking Tabatha Booth, cleverly interweaving her off-kilter humour with burlesque.\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n COMEDY\\nRose Bishop | Feral\\nChinese Museum, until April 9\\n Rose Bishop is a feral.\\n What is a feral? In Bishop’s view, it’s a term to depict the lower-socioeconomic class that she grew up around in regional Western Australia. Ferals will get drunk enough to ruin Christmas (but not bash anyone); ferals will get vaccinated as long as it’s covered by Medicare.\\n Directed by festival mainstay Claire Hooper, Bishop’s debut solo hour is a patchwork of stories about her own feral-ness – be it tales of an amorous kangaroo that she took in as a pet, looking after a greyhound allergic to its own teeth, aiming to always have sex on the first date or inheriting trauma instead of property.\\n Oh, and a frankly absurd anecdote about spending time on a billionaire sheikh’s super-yacht with snarky Russian sex workers. We’ve all been there, right?\\n While there is an over-reliance on expletives for laughs, Bishop’s well-structured storytelling and confident delivery makes for an impressive debut.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY & CABARET\\nAli McGregor | Late-Nite Variety-Nite Night\\nThe Famous Spiegeltent at Arts Centre Melbourne, March 31 (on until April 9)\\n At an indeterminate point in time, Ali McGregor’s Late-Night Variety-Nite Night reached cult status.\\n For 16 years, the soprano has plucked a melange of comedy and cabaret acts from a massive trove for a 75-minute showcase. Each evening, there’s a different haul.\\n A tight band of keyboards, drums and bass welcomes McGregor into the hazy lights of The Famous Spiegeltent – an ideal venue for such a show.\\n Not quite seamlessly, the acts pour onto the tiny stage.\\n First-up is comedian-actor Diana Nguyen, followed by hyper-expressive acrobat-artist Jess Love and her jaw-dropping hula-hoop set.\\n Comic/songwriter Gillian Cosgriff enchants with a keyboard takeover, skipping through a joyous observational score that lets rip.\\n Stand-up Carl Donnelly entrances with a 12-minute shower gel discussion.\\n McGregor, interspersing the acts with soaring, melodic mash-ups, describes it as a “bargain of a show”. Spot on.\\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\\n COMEDY & THEATRE\\nOsher Gunsberg | Night Time News Network National News\\nMalthouse Theatre – Beckett Theatre, until April 9\\n Osher Gunsberg drops his sanitised reality TV host persona for an evening of participatory theatre that satirises live news.\\n Performing alongside a ragtag Sydney-based improv troupe, unique headlines are written prior to each show, acting as a live prompt similar to Whose Line Is It, Anyway?\\n Gunsberg is dressed as a Ron Burgundy-esque news anchor in a pink suit and orange-rimmed glasses. His prologue – projected loudly in signature fashion – contextualises the show, laying the groundwork for a future commercial television pitch.\\n Incorporating live crosses and crew interactions, there’s inconsistency across the performers in their ability to deliver convincing news segments. Alex Reynolds and Orya Golgowsky are standouts in their world building, characterisations, facial expressions and physical comedy – getting the largest laughs in any sketch.\\n Reminiscent of The Chaser, this is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy show that could be ripped (but for liability reasons is not) straight from the headlines.\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nOpening Night Comedy Allstars Supershow\\nPalais Theatre, March 29\\n\\n A 150-minute melange of taste-testers, the annual Allstars Supershow delivers the audience bite-sized teasers to satiate every form of the comedic palate. This year, to mixed results.\\n Hannah Gadsby took on compering duties, and warmed the crowd with reflections of her recent marriage to her former tour manager. Anne Edmonds opened proceedings with her regular polemic style – shooting daggers at D-grade celebrities who seek fame on reality TV and commercial radio. Dilruk Jayasinha followed by bringing up the cricket rivalry between Australia and his home country of Sri Lanka – and the uneasy fact that his mother fancied the late Shane Warne.\\n On the international front, the beat-boxing skills of the Icelandic Ari Eldjarn landed soundly; American Kyle Kinane took shots at himself when referencing the January 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol and the social faux pas that comes with buying a telescope; and New Zealander Guy Montgomery skewered the Bechdel test and explained the difficulty of implementing it into his everyday life. All to uproarious effect.\\n Similarly, Douglas Lim, Anirban Dasgupta, Leo Reich and The Lucas Bros all easily won over the crowd – albeit it with a vastly ranging difference of styles.\\n Best Newcomer at Edinburgh Festival Fringe Lara Ricote delivered the most risque gag of the evening – regarding cysts in her reproductive organs and an abortion. It slayed the room. If the ABC actually air it during their broadcast next week, I wouldn’t want to be working in their complaints department.\\n Among all the well-placed bullseyes, there were of course a few that failed to hit the board.\\n David O’Doherty’s ongoing cheap keyboard shtick elicited yawns; Bronwyn Kuss’ never-ending repetitions about Tina Arena well overstayed its welcome; and Huge Davies’ barbs and impressions about modern-day dance music read the room about as well as Tommy Wiseau.\\n Georgie Carroll’s anecdotes about rotator cuff tears went down like a balloon over the seas of South Carolina; and headline grabber Reuben Kaye doubled down upon his recent controversy with Catholics by employing juxtapositions about the church, priests and drag queens. Clever enough, but you could see the punchlines coming from St Kilda Road.\\n Concluding the evening, Dave Thornton scored the highest decibels of applause of the night with a sharp attack at King Charles and for a proposition of vasectomies versus IQ levels.\\n A few lulls aside, inevitable in such a gargantuan event, the merriment of this year’s Allstars Supershow lit the fuse to set off the celebratory firework of more than 600 shows across the city over the next month.\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nElyce Phillips | Pretends to Be On Tropical Holiday For 50 Minutes (Definitely Not A Scam)\\nThe Butterfly Club, until April 7\\n Elyce Phillips has only been staying at premium luxury resort Poseidon Sands for a day. Or has she?\\n Featuring an elaborate mix of gross-out hijinks, well-crafted props and costumes, and sophisticated multimedia (no doubt drawing on Phillips’ other hat as an illustrator), nothing is immune from censure in Phillips’ delightfully chaotic, multilayered show.\\n The show’s episodic structure has Phillips oscillating between a bikini-clad tourist, a sea cucumber and the unwilling assistant of a chauvinistic big wet ham – among other characters – while the sound and light design effortlessly shifts the tonal register between sequences.\\n Phillips is a master at pulling the rug out from under her audience – nothing is what it seems at the ramshackle Poseidon Sands, too far from the beach to be anything other than the ‘jewel of the inner coast’.\\n The Butterfly Club, with its tightly packed pews and haunted tiki bar vibe, is the perfect setting for its unravelling.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair \\n COMEDY\\nBec Petraitis | Merry\\nCampari House, until April 9\\n The carols are pumping, the decorations are hung and the stage is set for the tale of Bec Petraitis’ Christmas Day, 2021, her worst on record.\\n It’s true, the Christmas in question was not that bad – something Petraitis is quick to point out when she promises at the outset nobody died. However, amid the COVID years, our tolerance for disappointment was low, and Petraitis is quite the Christmas fan.\\n What follows is a series of unfortunate events told with the aid of dramatic inner monologues, neat stagecraft, and a knack for storytelling.\\n With her expressive face and charming style, Petraitis’ tally of dissatisfactions brings frequent laughs of both recognition and sympathy. There are understated punchlines dispensed with dry wit and the occasional diversion into silliness, which delight the audience.\\n Here’s a performer who keeps the laughs rolling, the snark light and the atmosphere warm – just like a good Christmas.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nCourtney Crisfield | Cult Classic\\nQueen Victoria Women’s Centre, until April 18\\n You know that friend who always speaks in film quotes? That’s Courtney Crisfield.\\n In her own words, she was raised by movies, spawning a multi-faceted show featuring trivia, short films and costumed portrayals of recognisable characters that cinephiles would relish.\\n Parodying genres from horror to silent films, Crisfield disarms the audience with her awkward nerdiness, unafraid to call out the derivative nature of new cinema.\\n A working actor, the short films – in which Crisfield also stars – show off her acting chops, playing beloved protagonists from David Bowie in Labyrinth to Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind.\\n Cult Classic relies heavily on the make-shift cinema projector and it’s clear Crisfield has invested a lot into the film production aspects of the show. However, more weighting towards the live stand-up component would have made it more balanced.\\n Crisfield delivers an endearing Oscar-worthy performance that successfully convinces us why she’ll always love … movies.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nUrvi Majumdar | Urvi Went To An All Girls School\\nTrades Hall – Common Rooms Bar, until April 2\\n Urvi Majumdar reprises her debut solo show from 2022 for just four nights between the light-studded, grandiose purple curtains of the Common Rooms Bar. The setting evokes the same feeling as a high school formal – incidentally the pivotal event that foregrounds Majumdar’s recollection of her teenage years.\\n Reading verbatim from real-life journal entries out of a comically oversized stage prop diary, Majumdar swings between acting out her adolescent fears and humiliations and retrospectively examining these ordeals through an adult lens.\\n Her experience growing up as a first-generation Indian-Australian in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne is joyfully resurrected through Majumdar’s animated, confident storytelling and endearingly pithy quips – though she has the tendency to needlessly over-explain her well-crafted punchlines.\\n Majumdar’s deftly re-enacted MSN Messenger conversations, intentionally cringe dance sequences executed with the fist bump of an iPod and a jaunty noughties soundtrack has the audience laughing in shared recognition of a fraught but memorable period of heightened emotions and thwarted desires.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n The Melbourne International Comedy Festival is on now until April 23.

       "  'description': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\n Firelight\\nJohn Morrissey, Text, $32.99\\n\\nFirst Nations fiction and sci-fi might sound like strange bedfellows, although anyone who saw the Shadow Spirit exhibition at Melbourne’s Rising festival this year (which featured First Nations Star Wars characters alongside ancient stories and cultural knowledge) will know how fertile their conjunction can be. Kalkadoon author John Morrissey has produced a suite of short stories – some of them sci-fi, most within the realms of magical realist or speculative fiction – that investigate colonialism and identity with a keen eye and an uninhibited imagination. It’s a volume that features a little green man and the colonisation of the Moon, fraught attempts by scientists to reconstruct a thylacine, and a Gothic-tinged revenge fantasy in which an Aboriginal warrior haunts the white explorer responsible for his murder. An elegant and unpretentious narrative style allows Morrissey to reach for outlandish or bizarre elements with the irreducible impact of a lucid dream. It’s a fable-like, inventive, and well-crafted collection.\\n Serengotti\\nEugen Bacon, Transit Lounge, $32.99\\n Eugen Bacon’s Serengotti follows Ch’anzu, a gender-nonconforming narrator, on a day from hell. Ch’anzu loses hir job, and walks in (totally hungover) on hir wife Scarlet having pneumatic sex with a guy half her age. The opening chapters are set in contemporary Melbourne but there’s a hyperactive buzz of disorientation and dislocation in the prose, which has a futuristic feel and surges forward using the unusual second-person perspective. You’re put into Ch’anzu’s shoes as hir life crisis leads first to the wisdom of Aunt Mae, and on to a migrant African community, Serengotti, deep in the Australian bush. Eugen Bacon has a propulsive experimental style that voraciously incorporates idiom from urban, internet, Australian and African contexts to forge something new. Momentum builds quickly in this rush of a novel, which illuminates questions of gender and race as they are experienced, and has a sharper focus on how the world turns in urban Australia than most new fiction.\\n Prophet\\nHelen Macdonald & Sin Blache, Jonathan Cape, $34.99\\n Co-written during lockdown by Helen Macdonald (H is for Hawk) and Sin Blache, Prophet literally weaponises nostalgia. The title refers to a military-grade chemical that causes those exposed to it to fall into a nostalgic trance, creating figments of the past from treasured memories. Naturally, such a weapon could be disastrous in the wrong hands. And perhaps there are no right hands, as two agents – super-buff American action hero Adam, and dissolute but sharp-minded Rao, a former British intelligence operative – discover. Following Prophet’s destructive trail from Britain to the American West, it seems Prophet has new properties waiting to be unleashed. This sci-fi queer romance espionage thriller smashes together a bewildering array of genre fiction tropes, but it’s obsessively crafted, and has the kind of philosophical underpinning that makes it read more like postmodern fabulism than fanfic.\\n Temperance\\nCarol Lefevre, Wakefield, $34.95\\n It’s 1963 and widowed café owner Stella Madigan struggles to make ends meet after the death of her husband. The arrival of unconventional artist Mardi Rose promises a reprieve from working-class life for Stella and her young children, Fran and Theo, but when they embark upon a road trip to Byron Bay, they make it only as far as the tiny hamlet of Temperance in the Australian Outback. There, a horrifying and half-remembered incident turns the family back, and it will plague the children into their adult lives. Award-winning writer Carol Lefevre has a deft touch for psychological drama and the intricacies of domestic relationships. Here she takes a tightly stretched working-class canvas and loosens it into an evolving mystery (and a deferred coming-of-age tale) spanning decades. Lefevre is particularly good at showing the subtle effects of trauma, and the intensity of repressed emotion.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nBeeswax and Tall Tales\\nJane Crowley with Athol Salter, Ventura Press, $32.99\\n This polished collection of tales from the antiques trade could easily have been sub-titled “Life’s Little Ironies”, for the way it reflects human foibles in all their variety. Jane Crowley’s father, Athol Salter, has spent a lifetime buying and selling antiques and throughout that time continually shared the stories he gathered along the way with his daughter. Written from her father’s point of view, the stories are full of intriguing characters, from shifty types who get their comeuppance, a sad widower in Wagga whose last wish before suiciding is denied him by big-city lawyers, and a Welsh collector whose dying business is, to an extent, emblematic of the trade. And all of them revolving around selling artefacts, be it a bath, a chiffonier or an old farm table. Lovingly crafted and sure-footed, this could become a collector’s item.\\n Girls [Don’t] Play Sport\\nChloe Dalton, Allen & Unwin, $34.99\\n When Chloe Dalton was young watching her brothers play rugby she would practise kicking at half-time, often being told by adults that she should play the game. Her reply was, “Girls don’t play rugby”. In 2016 she won Olympic rugby gold in Rio. Her journey, her successes and her experience inform this combination of treatise and memoir. It also provides a snapshot of women in sport, citing, say, the struggle that swimming legend Fanny Durack had to get to the 1912 Olympics. In what is basically a call to arms she highlights the achievements, and prejudices that women’s sport still faces: pay, training facilities, misogyny, trolling and the reaction to the now iconic photo of Tayla Harris goaling from the 50-metre mark. Deeply passionate, her enthusiasm is infectious, and we can only hope one day nobody will think twice about girls playing footy – or any other sport, for that matter.\\n The Chipilly Six: Unsung Heroes of the Great War\\nLucas Jordan, NewSouth, $34.99\\n It takes a certain type of larrikin daredevil to do what six Australians soldiers did in the middle of the Battle of Amiens in August 1918. The allied offensive had been stopped by a line of German machine gunners on the spur above the Somme village of Chipilly. Repeated frontal assaults had failed. During the morning sergeants Jack Hayes and Harold Andrews went for a “stroll” into the village looking for souvenirs – as you do. That night they led a patrol of six, flanked the German gunners and took them out, capturing 71 prisoners and nine machine guns – achieving what an entire army couldn’t. It’s impossible to read this ripping, vivid recreation of events without shaking your head in disbelief. For years history paid scant attention to the “six”. This account (covering post-war years) and drawing on firsthand testimony corrects that.\\n The Shrinking Nation\\nGraeme Turner, UQP, $32.99\\n This is a sort of report card on Australian politics over the past 15 years, and it’s not good. The phrase “must try harder” comes to mind. Australia and the world have changed enormously in that time, but our national governments have gone missing in vital areas such as climate change, social welfare and closing the gap. The period, especially from Tony Abbott’s government on, was marked by what we might call policy paralysis, the ship of state was left to drift and the country has shrunk, so it’s “less than it was, less than it should be”. Graeme Turner’s clear, emphatic, convincing examination is a big-picture study of a time when the big picture deserted our politics. It’s also a searing indictment of decades of neo-liberalist hypocrisy. But there’s also hope, with Turner seeing positives in the busyness of the Albanese administration.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'This photograph captures a candid moment of two men, seemingly musicians David Byrne and Brian Eno, inside a Chemist Warehouse, a prominent Australian pharmacy chain. The image is rich in detail, showcasing not only the individuals but also the vibrant, bustling atmosphere of the store.\\n\\n**The Men:**\\n\\n* **David Byrne (left):**  Recognizable by his distinctive features and attire, Byrne stands slightly to the left of the frame. He is known as the former lead singer and guitarist of the influential new wave band Talking Heads. His musical career spans decades, marked by innovative work in various genres, including rock, funk, and world music.  He is also a visual artist, writer, and cyclist, known for his advocacy for urban cycling.  In the photograph, he wears a dark blazer over a dark, subtly patterned shirt and dark denim jeans. His expression is relaxed and approachable, almost as if he\\'s engaged in conversation.\\n\\n* **Brian Eno (right):**  Standing to the right, Eno, a renowned music producer, composer, and visual artist, complements Byrne\\'s presence.  Eno\\'s career is marked by pioneering work in ambient music and electronic music production. He has collaborated with numerous artists, including David Bowie, U2, and Coldplay, and is considered a highly influential figure in the music industry.  In the image, Eno wears a dark fedora, a dark blue plaid blazer, a black undershirt, and dark trousers.  He sports a full beard and a calm, almost contemplative expression.\\n\\n**The Setting: Chemist Warehouse**\\n\\nThe backdrop of the photograph is unmistakably a Chemist Warehouse. Several key visual elements confirm this:\\n\\n* **Bright Blue and Yellow Signage:** The dominant colors are the signature bright blue and yellow of the Chemist Warehouse branding. These colors are visible on the shelves, price tags, and promotional signs.\\n* **\"Cheaper @ Warehouse Prices\" Slogan:** This iconic slogan is clearly visible on yellow signs hanging from the ceiling, reinforcing the brand identity.\\n* **Product Placement and Pricing:** The shelves are stocked with a variety of health and beauty products, typical of a Chemist Warehouse.  Prominent brands like Colgate, Olay, and Nature\\'s Way are visible. The yellow price tags with black text are a characteristic feature of the store\\'s pricing strategy.\\n* **\"As Seen on TV\" Stickers:**  Many products feature circular stickers stating \"As Seen on TV,\" a common marketing tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.\\n* **\"Health Break\" Signage:**  The \"Health Break\" logo, a part of Chemist Warehouse\\'s branding for its health product sections, is visible on several shelves.\\n* **Metal Grid Shelving:** The metal grid shelving units are a standard fixture in Chemist Warehouse stores.\\n\\n**Composition and Details:**\\n\\nThe photograph is composed with the two men positioned centrally in the aisle, with shelves of products flanking them on both sides. This creates a sense of depth and draws the viewer\\'s eye towards the center. The aisle appears well-lit, likely due to fluorescent lighting typical of retail spaces.\\n\\nThe shelves are densely packed with products, creating a visually busy backdrop. The bright colors and varied packaging of the products contribute to the overall vibrancy of the scene.  The price tags, with their bold yellow and black design, stand out against the colorful products, emphasizing the store\\'s focus on value.\\n\\nThe \"3\" signs hanging from the ceiling, indicating further discounts, are a common promotional tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.  The \"Discount Chemist 50% Go\" sign suggests a sale or special offer on selected items.\\n\\nThe floor appears to be a light-colored tile, typical of retail environments.  A circular floor sticker, possibly indicating social distancing guidelines, is partially visible near Eno\\'s feet.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe photograph presents a striking juxtaposition of the two renowned musicians against the backdrop of a busy, everyday retail setting. The contrast between the artistic personas of Byrne and Eno and the commercial environment of Chemist Warehouse creates a sense of intrigue. The image captures a seemingly spontaneous moment, lending it a candid and unposed feel.  The vibrant colors, dense product displays, and prominent branding of Chemist Warehouse create a visually stimulating environment that further enhances the photograph\\'s impact. The presence of text throughout the image, from product names and prices to promotional slogans, adds another layer of detail and context. This photograph is not only a portrait of two influential musicians but also a snapshot of a particular time and place, capturing the essence of a ubiquitous Australian retail experience.\\n'},\n",

       "  'description': 'Rome: When Travis Scott asked Rome to make some noise at the Circus Maximus on Monday, Rome cheerfully complied.\\n The 60,000-odd spectators jumped so vigorously that some locals panicked, thinking that an earthquake was underway.\\n Archaeologists were alarmed by the vibrations and questioned the wisdom of holding musical events at an ancient site, where chariot races were held more than 2,000 years ago and to which Julius Caesar later added his own decorating touch.\\n The concert coincided with the release of Scott’s chart-topping new album, Utopia. He was joined by Ye, the rap star formerly known as Kanye West.\\n The show in Rome marked Ye’s first concert appearance after a series of antisemitic remarks on social media and in interviews last year led to his expulsion from social media for a time and theseries of antisemitic remarks. When he came onstage, the crowd roared and jumped some more.\\n Romans, including those living some distance from the site, took to social media to lament shaking windows, beds and chandeliers.\\n In more recent years, the Circus Maximus has played host to major open-air rock concerts, including shows by the Rolling Stones, Lady Gaga and, this summer, Bruce Springsteen, Guns N’ Roses and Imagine Dragons.\\n The circus has also hosted the summer season of Rome’s opera.\\n Giovanni Diaferia, a seismologist at the Italian Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, calculated: “60k people, 70 kg each, jumping and reaching 0.15 m from ground radiate an energy of E = 6.2 MJ which is equivalent to a magnitude 1.3 earthquake, at each jump!! Enough to be recorded by a seismic station 9 km away.”\\n On Tuesday, the institute said in an online note that its national seismic network stations “clearly registered the enthusiasm of Travis Scott fans in concert at Circus Maximus”.\\n Similar activity was registered in 2021, when Italy won the European Championship soccer final, as well as earlier this year when Naples won the Serie A championship, the institute said.\\n In July, a Taylor Swift concert in Seattle shook the ground so hard, it registered signals roughly equivalent to a magnitude 2.3 earthquake, seismologists said.\\n A seismogram identified several points during the Scott concert, which lasted under 90 minutes, “with evident peaks of jubilation” on the part of fans, according to the institute.\\n In the aftermath, Alfonsina Russo, who oversees the Archaeological Park of the Colosseum, Rome’s most important archaeological area, called on city officials to stop using the Circus Maximus for mass events and to put it to more cultural use.\\n Russo told the AGI news agency on Tuesday that the circus was a historical monument, not a stadium, and that “mega-concerts put it at risk”.\\n Archaeological experts had given advice to the city for such events, and Russo said she had expressed concerns about the decibel levels and about spectators jumping in place.\\n “In my opinion, musical events can be held, but they should be carefully chosen like opera and ballet,” she told AGI. “Rock concerts are best held in stadiums to not endanger public safety.”\\n There was a moment of panic during the Scott show. Italian news media reported that around 60 people had to be treated for eye and throat irritation, possibly because someone used pepper spray in the crowd.\\n Nearly five years ago, pepper spray used at a nightclub, where a rapper was to perform, in the central Italian town of Corinaldo led to a stampede that killed six people and left nearly 200 people injured.\\n Attempts to reach the organisers of Scott’s concert were unsuccessful.\\n In 2021, 10 people were crushed to death and hundreds more were injured at a concert by Scott at his Astroworld Festival in Houston. Scott was investigated, but a grand jury declined to indict him or others connected to the festival. A number of lawsuits against Scott and festival organisers are pending.\\n On Wednesday, Alessandro Onorato, Rome’s City Council member responsible for tourism and events, defended the mega-concerts.\\n Beyond the money spent by concertgoers visiting from around the world, he said, fees to use the Circus Maximus for concerts last year brought 2.1 million euros, or $3.5 million, into city coffers. The funds were earmarked for the city department that maintains city-owned archaeological monuments, he added.\\n Without these fees, Roman taxpayers would have to pay up, he said in a Facebook live feed. “There were zero incidents, zero people got hurt,” he said of Scott’s concert.\\n This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'headline': 'The acclaimed writer dictating daily dispatches from his hospital bed',\n",
       "  'description': 'Just after Christmas, writer Hanif Kureishi was taking a long walk in Rome, where he and his wife, Isabella D’Amico, were spending the holiday, when he suddenly collapsed onto the sidewalk. It is unclear why — perhaps he fainted, said his son Carlo Kureishi, or perhaps he suffered an epileptic fit — but he fell awkwardly, twisting his neck and grievously injuring the top of his spine.\\n When Hanif Kureishi regained his senses, he was lying in a pool of blood, unable to move his arms or his legs.\\n “It occurred to me that there was no co-ordination between what was left of my mind and what remained of my body,” he wrote, via dictation, a few days later on Twitter. “I had become divorced from myself. I believed I was dying. I believed I had three breaths left.”\\n Taken to Gemelli Hospital, Kureishi spent the next several days “profoundly traumatised, altered and unrecognisable to myself”, he said on Twitter. “At the moment, it is unclear whether I will ever be able to walk again, or whether I’ll ever be able to hold a pen.”\\n Since then, Kureishi, 68, a novelist, screenwriter, playwright and director best known for My Beautiful Laundrette and The Buddha of Suburbia, has been dictating daily dispatches from his hospital bed.\\n In vivid, poignant prose, he is narrating his ongoing drama but also conjuring memories, musing about writing and art, and describing the terrifying, sometimes transcendent profundity of being dependent on the love and patience of others.\\n The posts are presented as series of tweets and also compiled as a Substack newsletter — postcards from an unfolding crisis. They have touched a nerve in readers, who have responded with practical advice, as well as messages of love, support and gratitude for what they say has been an extraordinary model of grace and imagination in the midst of calamity.\\n “We are all with you in this room, lying next to you on your trolley and staring at the ceiling tiles,” a Twitter user named Affi Parvizi-Wayne wrote. “Your beautiful writing transports us every day to your world.”\\n Kureishi first said he wanted to post something on social media a few days after the accident, his son said in an interview. “He’s not a private person in that respect,” Carlo Kureishi said. “He’s always been autobiographical in his writing.”\\n He started dictating, almost in the way of an old-time, pre-internet reporter phoning in a story to the office. (As he speaks, he notes the paragraph breaks, for example, by saying “new paragraph”.)\\n “It came out very naturally, very fluidly,” his son said. “I thought that was that.” But the first posts attracted a great deal of interest, in part because Hanif Kureishi was channelling the fears of so many readers.\\n “What happened to my dad is pretty much the event that’s uppermost in people’s minds of what they don’t want to happen to them,” Carlo Kureishi said.\\n The tweets are brave, profound, playful, lyrical, despairing and occasionally very funny. Mentioning an impending rectal exam, Hanif Kureishi recalled the last one he had, courtesy of the public National Health Service back in England. The nurse mistook him for Salman Rushdie.\\n “As the nurse flipped me over she asked me, ‘How long did it take you to write Midnight’s Children?’” Kureishi wrote. “I replied, ‘If I had indeed written Midnight’s Children, don’t you think I would have gone private?’”\\n As it happens, the two writers are old friends. “My friend Salman Rushdie, one of the bravest men I know, a man who has stood up to the most evil form of Islamofascism, writes to me every single day, encouraging patience,” Kureishi wrote in one Twitter post. “He should know,” he added, a reference to the vicious stabbing attack on Rushdie last summer. “He gives me courage.”\\n Kureishi is about to move to a specialty rehabilitation hospital, and his recovery is likely to be arduous and uncertain. After an operation on his neck to reduce some of the swelling around his spinal cord, he has regained glimmers of movement in his legs and the tips of his fingers, his son said. No one has made a definitive prognosis, though a physical therapist recently “promised that I would raise a pen again with my right hand”, Kureishi wrote on Thursday.\\n The author has been grappling daily with the recalibration of his closest relationships — with his three sons, his wife, and his ex-wife, producer Tracey Scoffield, to whom he remains close. “This bomb has also shattered the lives of those around me,” he wrote.\\n “People love to be kind and help one another,” he added. “They also resent their dependence on each other and the fact they can’t do everything for themselves. My accident was a physical tragedy, but the emotional outcomes for all of us are going to be significant, but also very interesting.”\\n In one of his posts, Kureishi talked about his love of the physical act of putting pen to paper, how he likes to “write a word, a sentence, then another sentence, until I feel something wake up inside me”.\\n “As I make these marks, I begin to hear characters speaking, and then they start speaking to each other if I’m lucky; if I’m even luckier, they might start amusing one another,” he continued. “I’m sure many painters, writers, architects, sports people and gardeners love their tools, and see their tools as an extension of their body.\\n “I hope one day I will be able to go back to using my own precious and beloved instruments.”\\n This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'CRIME FICTION\\nDeath in the Sauna\\nDennis Altman\\nClouds of Magellan Press, $34.99\\n It’s leather night at Spartacus, a discreet London sauna that is a meeting place for gay men. It’s also two days before a Global AIDS Conference, and Pomfrey Lister, the eminent virologist, founder and President of the Global AIDS Trust, is lying naked and serenely dead in a cubicle with a half empty bottle of amyl nitrate in his hand. So begins Dennis Altman’s elegant whodunnit in which everyone, in true Agatha Christie mode, is a suspect.\\n The author of Homosexual: Oppression and Liberation, first published in 1971, Altman is a distinguished academic who has himself served on the board of many AIDS initiatives across the world. Here he draws on that experience to present a wry, poignant, restrained murder mystery that unfolds against the backdrop of a major AIDS convention in 2003. In relation to which, there’s some amusing asides about the minor royal who opens the event who would clearly much rather be at Wimbledon, and the missing wife of a central Asian despot who went shopping two days earlier and hasn’t been seen since.\\n Sadly, the man who might have managed these various hiccups is now dead. Summoned to the sauna, Pomfrey’s colleague and rival for control of the Trust, Spencer Carson, thinks it would be much better if Pomfrey were discovered at home, in bed, dead of a massive heart attack.\\n So does Mary, Pomfrey’s wife, who has yet to come to terms with her husband’s double life, and so Pomfrey’s body is immediately relocated and quickly cremated. But there are suspicions.\\n The unlikely sleuth in this telling tale is Noel, Pomfrey’s former lover. A mild-mannered second-hand bookseller, Noel just happened to spot Pomfrey’s bright red Bentley outside Spartacus on the night in question and suspects Pomfrey was cheating on him. For his own peace of mind, Noel needs to know. He thought they had made a commitment.\\n After teaming up with Sylvie, Pomfrey’s former assistant, who incidentally collects early editions of Agatha Christie novels, Noel embarks on a quest to determine Pomfrey’s fidelity, or not. Searching for the attendant who first discovered his lover’s body, Noel heads to Brighton. There he stays in the rather shabby gay bed and breakfast establishment, Brigadoon, run by the irrepressible Maurice who is rehearsing for the role of Miss Prism in the Brighton Wilde Players production ofThe Importance of Being Earnest.\\n What is so endearing and engaging about Altman’s first crime novel is that all the characters, however minor, have intricate lives and backstories that render them profoundly human, even if their motives and actions might be questionable. Take Mary, Pomfrey’s widow, who bears “a slight resemblance to Judi Dench”. Her AIDS work in Africa involving virginity and abstinence is based on her belief that sex is the cause “of so much misery.” No wonder Pomfrey strayed.\\n Altman’s touch is deft and his wit razor sharp. Agatha would have surely approved, but I’m not sure what she would have made of leather night at Spartacus.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nHow to Love Your Daughter\\nHila Blum, Bloomsbury, $32.99\\n Total estrangement between family members holds a peculiar fascination for those of us fortunate enough not to have experienced it. You’ll have no trouble imagining how even love might cause such a rift after reading Hila Blum’s How to Love Your Daughter. It begins with Yoella, spying upon her daughter Leah (and two grandchildren she has never met) having dinner in an Amsterdam suburb. She has flown from her home in Israel, many years after Leah cut her out of her life without a word, and flies back again after a tantalising glimpse of her child, determined to make sense of what went wrong between them. In this sense, it is a detective novel in which suspect and sleuth are one and the same. Disquiet builds as Yoella sifts through the past for clues, dredging up memories of her late husband Meir, and the family’s life together as Leah grew up. A tenuous hope survives this quietly observed examination of how maternal love can misfire, stifling what it strives to nurture.\\n Audition\\nPip Adam, Giramondo, $29.95\\n Three giants hurtle through the galaxy aboard the spaceship Audition. Alba, Stanley and Drew have grown and will continue to grow unless they talk, which they do unceasingly, both to restrain their alarming bodily expansion and to fuel their vessel as it searches for a new home among the stars. Blending science fiction and social realism, Pip Adam’s Audition is an audacious novel that gives voice to the marginalised and underprivileged, and as the enforced stream of chatter burgeons, it becomes clear each of the giants is a social outcast jettisoned from Earth as punishment. It can be a tough read – the dialogue writhes between small talk and desperate confession with limited insight; it often rides waves of inarticulacy. And yet this bleak experimental fable arrives at new possibilities, the implied critique of the society from which the characters have been exiled yielding to alien worlds. It won’t be for everyone, but there’s a bold integrity to this outlier of a novel that will attract writers and readers interested in pushing the limits of genre.\\n Vincent & Sien\\nSilvia Kwon, Macmillan, $34.99 \\n More has been unearthed over the past few years about the biography of Sien Hoornik, Vincent van Gogh’s only live-in lover, but many details remain sketchy and a novelistic treatment has plenty of gaps for the imagination to fill. Silvia Kwon takes us to The Hague in 1882, where the struggling artist first takes in Sien and her young daughter on a bitterly cold winter’s night. They will live together for 18 months, Vincent entranced by her strength of personality and the hardships endured in her former life as a sex worker. Sien takes on the role of model and muse – to survive, though she is convinced she will die by her own hand – but as the connection between the couple deepens, they face intense hostility from Vincent’s immediate family. Novels portraying artists and muses, especially those paying attention to the woman’s perspective, are almost a subgenre in themselves, and this one should appeal to art lovers curious for insight into a formative relationship involving a famously tormented artistic genius.\\n God Forgets About the Poor\\nPeter Polites, Ultimo Press, $34.99\\n A tender novel about a migrant mother, God Forgets About the Poor starts winningly in the imperative mood … as if the writer’s mother were bossing him about, offering unsolicited advice and anecdotes about why and how her story should be told. The tale stretches from poverty and civil war – hardships difficult for the mother’s descendants in Australia to imagine – in a remote mountain village on a Greek island. The contrast with 21st century Sydney couldn’t be starker. Villagers confront death as an inescapable reality: they’re bound together by the struggle to survive, the beauty of the landscape, intensity of religious feeling. This imagined Greek village is draped not in nostalgia but a vibrant earthiness, a dignity in the face of conditions that were anything but dignified. Peter Polites is also sensitive to the ways in which migrant stories can be reduced, stereotyped and consumed in mainstream publishing, and is at pains to give voice to the complexity and richness of his subject’s experience.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nMy Mother, The Spy\\nCindy Dobbin & Freda Marnie Nicholls, Allen & Unwin, $34.99\\n Mercia Masson, journalist and spy, mother of Cindy Dobbin, started working for naval intelligence in 1943 and was later recruited by ASIO to report on the Communist Party and suspected spy rings. But her daughter knew virtually nothing about Mercia’s double life (and she emerges as a cold and distant mother) until after she died. Mind you, Masson had been exposed in 1955 by the Petrov Royal Commission, because of which she claimed to have “lost everything”. For the most part, though, this is a realistic portrait of the humdrum activities of most spy work, all written in the third person from the point of view of the daughter trying to discover who her mother was. Among other things, it asks the question if the clandestine life of operatives is imposed on them by the secrecy of their work, or whether certain types are drawn to it.\\n Your Name Is Not Anxious\\nStephanie Dowrick, Allen & Unwin, $29.99\\n Frederick Nietzsche famously called his chronic pain “dog”, attempting to control it as you would a pet. Stephanie Dowrick, writer and psychotherapist, addressing the reader – in particular anyone suffering anxiety – directly as “you”, makes a similar point. “You” are in control and this, basically, is a handbook for self-therapy. Chronic anxiety “colonises” the sufferer, making them feel powerless. The task is to “de-colonise” yourself and put anxiety in its place through self-therapy (not ruling out consultative therapy). At the core of this is getting in contact with the total of your being, physical, intellectual and spiritual, contextualising anxiety and, among other things, being kind to yourself. Using case studies and personal history she expertly guides the reader through complex material, making perfect sense.\\n Shake Some Action\\nStuart Coupe, Penguin, $35\\n\\nNot many people can claim to have saved Richard Ford’s life, but Stuart Coupe can, after the American writer looked the wrong way before crossing the street and was hauled back by Coupe, supposedly in the nick of time. This book is mainly a catalogue of encounters, largely as music writer and manager, in the rock business. And it’s an impressive catalogue, from the spectacular (hanging out backstage with Bruce Springsteen in Paris, not to mention Mick Jagger), to the seedy (observing roadies selecting female fans in the ’70s for an unnamed band’s pleasure). It’s also, to some extent, an incidental retrieval of how journalism has changed over the decades – Coupe recounting his experience of taking copy into the newspaper office and handing it to the editor. Woven into this is his Launceston childhood and the origins of his passion for music writing.\\n The World of Sugar\\nUlbe Bosma, Belknap Press, $63.95\\n\\nOnce, like salt and pepper, the granules extracted from cane known as “white gold” were a luxury only the richest could savour. But from the middle ages a massive industry evolved, to the extent that today the average European consumes 40 kilos of sugar a year (60 in the US). It is an industry with a seriously dark past and a menacing present in terms of world health, WHO declaring sugar-driven obesity a pandemic in 1999. Ulbe Bosma’s history of sugar is also a case study of global capitalism over the centuries, colonial wars, and the deadly slave trade that made the industry possible. It may be a history of a sweet substance, but it has a bitter aftertaste. Like most studies that tell us how rubber, salt and paper changed the world, it’s formulaic. But it’s an interesting account of how sugar seeped into the global digestive system.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'Spoiler Alert ★★★½\\nM, 112 minutes\\n The title of Michael Ausiello’s bestselling memoir, Spoiler Alert: The Hero Dies, mixes irony and bravado in equal measure.\\n Ausiello says his book isn’t a “misery memoir”. Even though the plot hinges on a diagnosis of terminal cancer, fun and romance have equally important parts to play.\\n Michael Showalter’s film of the book drops the spoiler from the title, but we learn the worst in the opening scene. Then we’re into a flashback recounting what is essentially a love story. It begins in 2001 when Ausiello (Jim Parsons) and Kit Cowan (British actor Ben Aldridge) meet at a Manhattan club.\\n They’re an unlikely pair. Kit is a buff, charming photographer who has always preferred casual sex to steady relationships, and Michael (Jim Parsons) is a nerdy vegetarian who drinks Diet Coke and wears button-down shirts buttoned up. He’s an entertainment journalist with a special interest in sitcoms and soaps. And that’s not all. When Kit is finally permitted to visit his apartment, he finds that it’s been colonised by the Smurf collection Ausiello has been acquiring since childhood.\\n Ausiello wrote the book after Kit’s death. It grew from a series of Facebook posts read by the couple’s family and friends, one of whom was an editor at Simon & Schuster. And Showalter has succeeded in catching its spirit – its intimacy, its self-deprecating sense of humour and Ausiello’s habit of seeing life through the prism of the television shows he loved as a kid. Both his parents died when he was young and the shows take him back to the times when he was at his happiest. So, too, does the Smurf collection.\\n Kit’s parents are very much alive. His mother, Marilyn (Sally Field) competes in triathlons – despite her stately pace and dodgy knees – and his father, Bob (Bill Irwin) is kept busy carrying out his wife’s orders. Kit’s relationship with Michael finally gives him the courage to tell them that he’s gay and they do better than approve. They embrace Michael as a surrogate son.\\n The film is episodic in shape. The couple go through many ups and downs during the 13 years they spend together and the script canvasses them all. Sometimes the tone is a little too cute but Showalter (The Eyes of Tammy Faye) and his writers have a persuasive ability to defuse the looming threat of sentimentality with comedy.\\n Aldridge is terrific as the easy-going Kit, who’s been blessed with such physical confidence that the disease comes as both shock and betrayal, and Field knows exactly when to rein in the indomitable Marilyn. It’s a disarming film.\\n Spoiler Alert is in cinemas from February 9.\\n A cultural guide to going out and loving your city. Sign up to our Culture Fix newsletter here.\\n'},\n",

       "  'description': 'Jeff Tweedy was bruised and shaken after taking a 15-metre fall down the side of a cliff. When he looked up, comedian Nick Offerman and author George Saunders were looking down at him with concern on their faces.\\n No, this wasn’t a dream. This actually happened four years ago on a five-day hike in Glacier National Park in Montana, when the Wilco frontman slipped on melting ice.\\n Yes, Tweedy is “pals”, as he puts it, with the star of Parks And Recreation and the Booker Prize-winning writer.\\n “I met Nick when I appeared on Parks And Rec,” says Tweedy, reclining on a couch in his basement in Chicago after a day of rehearsals with Wilco for their upcoming world tour, a cat-shaped pillow behind his head and a collection of his late father’s electronic gadgets lining the shelves.\\n “Apparently the conversation in the writers’ room went something like, ‘We need to find an ageing, washed-up rock star.’ And someone else said, ‘someone like Jeff Tweedy?’ And someone else said, ′Well, why don’t we just ask Jeff Tweedy?’”\\n Offerman interviewed Tweedy and Saunders separately for his book Gumption, about 21 Americans who had shaped his world. Tweedy met Saunders when the two appeared on the final episode of The Colbert Report, along with a rollcall of over 100 guests that included Cookie Monster, Willie Nelson, Cyndi Lauper, George Lucas and Henry Kissinger.\\n “George is one of my favourite authors, so I went searching for him backstage,” recalls Tweedy. “I saw him come out of the door of one of the dressing rooms and I said, ‘You’re the person I’m most excited to meet here.’ And he said, ‘Well, I was just coming to find you.’ It was very romantic.”\\n Saunders told Tweedy he had listened to the sprawling Wilco song One Sunday Morning (Song For Jane Smiley’s Boyfriend) over and over every day while writing some of the stories in his collection Tenth Of December.\\n He went on to write a piece about the song for The New York Times Magazine in 2016, calling it “a reliable 12-minute prayer” and calling Tweedy “one of the great conversational poets of our time.”\\n It wasn’t long before “a three-way bromance” (Offerman’s words in an interview with Stephen Colbert) was instigated, starting with long text threads between the trio, and culminating in the hike, which made its way into Offerman’s latest book, Where The Deer And The Antelope Play.\\n Tweedy himself is also on a roll in the book-writing department. He has already published two – the 2018 memoir Let’s Go (So We Can Get Back) and 2020’s How To Write One Song.\\n The latter is a revealing and generous book about the creative process and why he thinks everyone should do it. He writes about pushing your ego out of the way and creating for the sake of creativity, and the feeling of disappearing when you’re truly in the moment.\\n I point out that people also use drugs to disappear. Tweedy, 56, used to be addicted to prescription opiates he took for crippling migraines. How did things change for him creatively when he got sober 19 years ago?\\n “It would be more accurate to say that I created those older songs in spite of being an addict,” he says. “Those issues I had were a distraction and sapped my energy, but the part of myself I was writing from was the part that was there before I did drugs. It was the part of me that was childlike and wanted a song to sing. That was the big revelation for me when I got sober. And that’s why I can still sing those songs and not feel like they were written by a different person.“\\n Wilco are a self-sufficient band with their own studio, The Loft. But for the latest Wilco album, Cousin, they invited Welsh singer-songwriter Cate Le Bon to produce.\\n “I met Cate when she played Solid Sound (the Massachusetts festival Tweedy curates) in 2019,” he says. “We performed an Arthur Russell song and Strangers by The Kinks together and hit it off right away. Then whenever Cate and her band came through Chicago on tour they would either stay at The Loft or use it for rehearsals. She just became part of the family.\\n “And when I heard her version of the Wilco song Company In My Back, which she recorded at The Loft for a cover-mount CD for Mojo magazine, it blew me away because it was such an imaginative arrangement and a unique sound. So I thought I’d ask her to produce us.“\\n A couple of the new songs are among the most politically pointed Tweedy has penned. Ten Dead came from a news story he saw on TV about yet another US school shooting.\\n “The reporter literally said ‘only 10 dead’,” says Tweedy, slowly shaking his head. “He almost had this tone of disappointment that it wasn’t a bigger news story. Or maybe he was saying ‘Well, it’s good that it was only ten.’ Either way, it was an appalling thing to say.\\n “And look, I know we hear people singing songs about things like this and go, ‘Oh yeah, the world was really waiting for you to weigh in on this. Thank you for appropriating someone else’s trauma.’ But I was trying to highlight the insanity of this becoming so matter-of-fact. The rational response to this is ‘No, this can’t happen anymore.’ It’s painfully obvious what we should do about it. Instead, we hear people talking about giving kids bulletproof backpacks.”\\n The title track is close to home, aimed at relatives who expressed far-right views after Donald Trump came to power.\\n “It’s really more about my dad than me. Before he died (in 2017) he saw family members turn their backs on democracy and decency. They felt emboldened to express their bigotry. It was something that deeply upset my father. He wasn’t a liberal by any means. He grew up in southern Illinois and he worked on the railroad. But he was decent and smart and thought Trump was what he called ‘a boss’s son’. And, in his mind, there was nothing worse than that.“\\n Tweedy has a third book due out in November. The World Within A Song will be his deep dive into 50 songs by other artists. Despite the fact he had already written a memoir, he found this book ended up being even more autobiographical, “because songs become part of our own biography, they work their way into our memories and self-image.”\\n Many of Tweedy’s choices will be unsurprising to those who follow his work: Mavis Staples, The Replacements, Dolly Parton, the Velvet Underground. But a couple may put the cat among Wilco’s “dad rock” contingent – and perhaps educate them.\\n “I chose I Love You by Billie Eilish, because, like a lot of her songs, it has this majestic, sublime melody. I think she and her brother would have been successful songwriters and performers in any era. Her songs are like jazz or torch songs, but she’s extremely modern.\\n “And I chose a song by Rosalia because I think she may be the greatest artist walking the earth right now. She has this incredible gift and she made this quantum leap from studying flamenco as a young girl to basically reinventing reggaeton music. It’s like she’s Miles Davis or Pablo Picasso. She had to be in the book.”\\n Cousin is out now. Wilco play The Forum in Melbourne on March 16, 17 and 18; the Sydney Opera House on March 22 and the Enmore Theatre on November 22.\\n'},\n",

       "  'description': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nGreen Dot\\nMadeleine Gray, Allen & Unwin, $32.99\\n This Gen Z novel has all the trappings of a Bridget Jones-style romcom though its young heroine is cleverer, more cynical, and more hopelessly trapped, not only by the apparent unreachability of anything like a stable income, but by the anxieties and rationalisations underneath all the sass. Hera Stephen has reached her mid-twenties and rather enjoys her job, despite being miserably paid, as a comment moderator in a Sydney newsroom. She falls for a nerdy, older married colleague, Arthur. Like everyone else in her life, Hera has seen that story before – how could she not have? – but goes for it anyway. Madeleine Gray’s Green Dot stands out from a pack of “hot mess” novels for its wit and sensitivity, the singularity of the voice, the way it resists cliché. Some readers will be frustrated by Hera, who seems besotted by failure as much as the “ordinary happiness” Arthur appears to represent, but as she navigates questions of success, adulthood, and love itself, it’s hard not to admire her.\\n\\n\\n The Last Devil to Die\\nRichard Osman, Viking, $34.99\\n The popular Thursday Murder Club series continues in this fourth book. If you’re unfamiliar, it features a group of elderly amateur sleuths solving crimes from what proves to be the most lethal retirement village in the land.\\n Former spook Elizabeth Best, union man Ron Ritchie, nurse Joyce Meadowcroft, and psychiatrist Ibrahim Arif are at it again. In The Last Devil to Die, a character who assisted them in a previous investigation is found murdered, and a heroin shipment has vanished into thin air. The gang has a wealth of experience between them, and are accustomed to leveraging the fact that codgers and little old ladies tend to be underestimated or ignored. The team must find the killer as the body count rises, even as one member faces their own rapid decline. Newcomers should start at the beginning, and fans will be pleased to know the author has promised to complete another instalment.\\n The Love Contract\\nSteph Vizard, HarperCollins, $22.99\\n Steph Vizard’s The Love Contract nimbly stitches the tropes of romantic fiction onto the modern crisis in childcare. After her long-term relationship breaks down, Zoe decides to go it alone as a single mum. Crunch-time comes when she must return to work but can’t find anyone to mind little Hazel. Enter her neighbour and nemesis, Will – an arrogant lawyer whose boss mistakes Zoe for Will’s wife and insists that he take parental leave. The situation might solve all their problems, assuming Zoe and Will can put down their swords long enough to fake a romantic relationship, and Will cares for the tot while Zoe’s at work, of course. True to form, they draw up a contract. What seems cut and dry on paper runs into love’s fine print: there’s only so long you fake it till you make it. Vizard is clearly a Janeite, and though her novel can’t match the wit or observation of Austen, it adapts the timeless perversities of the human heart into a contemporary context, in a finely constructed narrative that readers will breeze through.\\n Light Over Liskeard\\nLouis de Bernières, Harvill Secker, $34.99\\n My prize for the year’s most irritating dystopia goes to Louis de Bernières’ Light Over Liskeard. The author of Captain Corelli’s Mandolin is no stranger to eccentric dead ends – Red Dog consisted of silly short tales about an Australian kelpie, for instance – but this confection seems such a half-hearted blob of misanthropic whimsy it’s a wonder he finished it at all. Arthur, or “Q”, is a middle-aged quantum cryptographer warned of an imminent technological crisis. He retreats to rural Cornwall where he converts a rundown farmhouse into an elaborate bunker to survive the coming apocalypse. Quirky characters bustle through the moors, among them an Edwardian schoolgirl’s ghost, a survivalist Scot, the rugged park ranger Theo, and his daughter Eva, an artist who runs everywhere and somehow develops an interest in Q the reader struggles to share. If the author intended to extol simple country life over a technological hellscape, he fails. Glimpses of the city (an indolent populace titillated by sexbots, tormented by fully automated restaurants) are more fun, with genuine satiric potential.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nMy Father’s Shadow\\nSandra Goldbloom Zurbo, Monash University Publishing, $32.99\\n Sandra Goldbloom Zurbo’s evocative, often moving study of her complex relationship with her father is as much a homage as a memoir. Samuel Goldbloom was a Jewish, Moscow-line communist whose politics touched every part of domestic life when she was growing up in Melbourne.\\n “Everything is political,” Samuel lectured at dinners. She admired him (treated the line as gospel, and travelled overseas with him for political events), and rebelled against him. He could be supporting and loving, but there were also “wollopings” for transgressions and sarcastic putdowns. He cast a long shadow, but she discovers a kind of resolution in his death and its wake, finding solace in knowing that through it all they loved each other.\\n Alan Joyce & Qantas\\nPeter Harbison, with Derek Sadubin, Penguin, $36.99\\n There has been no more spectacular fall from corporate grace in recent years than that of Qantas, from beloved national icon to trashed brand. And it was Alan Joyce in the pilot seat. This mix of biography and career assessment is an attempt to contextualise Joyce’s time in charge, Peter Harbison pointing out that the first part of this century was either disastrous or seriously testing for airlines worldwide (Air New Zealand went bust and the state had to acquire it), and concludes that “in seeking to make the airline bulletproof, Joyce surely couldn’t have done much better”. Scandal, inquest, sackings and severe customer backlash notwithstanding, he is optimistic that “Qantas’s reputation will recover faster than most would expect”. Others might suggest that pigs, as well as kangaroos, might fly too.\\n Abortion Care is Health Care\\nBarbara Baird, MUP, $40\\n “It is estimated,” says Barbara Baird, “that between one in three and one in four Australian women will have an abortion during their lifetime.” Baird does not address the moral dimension of the abortion issue, which has long been decided, the majority of Australians being “pro-choice”. The main question her book addresses is why there is a lag between public opinion and public health in providing abortion care, abortions – emblematic of what she calls “neoliberal abortion” – being provided “predominantly” by the private sector, at cost to the patient, and favours urban dwellers rather than those in rural and remote communities. She incorporates interviews and case studies (one, a Cairns woman arrested in 2009 for taking abortion medication), and while there is some unnecessary jargon it is accessibly written.\\n Our Fragile Moment\\nMichael Mann, Scribe, $35\\n It is ironic, says Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann, that it was climate change (the impact of a massive asteroid 65 million years ago) that made humanity and our Goldilocks Earth possible – and it’s climate change that may well imperil it.\\n In this combination of science and history, he says the past can help us understand the current challenge. He cites case studies such as the collapse of the Akkadian Empire because of severe drought, but also cautions that we need to embrace “scientific uncertainty” and that answers to climate-change questions aren’t always “cut and dried”. In this sense, he seeks to occupy a middle ground between two extremes – denialism (aided by the conservative media, especially News Corp) and doomism – in addressing the reality of climate change. Mann can qualify his arguments a bit much, but this is timely.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. Get it delivered every Friday.\\n'},\n",

I make myself a coffee, clear my schedule and try to avoid the cut and thrust of newsroom life for a few minutes to write to you with some level of clarity. Usually I find some way to provide you with a subscriber-only peek behind the curtain of what we do.\\n Draw back that curtain today and you will find me looking a bit like the eponymous Wizard of Oz, busily pulling on levers, turning the wheels and pressing buttons in an attempt to create a facade of order. But news is a messy business and today was one of those messy days full of unpredictability.\\n In fact, all week the news cycle has been full of unpredictability, a far cry from the set pieces I discussed with you last week.\\n There have been plenty of big stories that have dropped out of nowhere, forcing the newsroom to scramble into a state of coordinated chaos. These stories are otherwise known by the most overused moniker in media: “breaking news”.\\n Often such stories involve an unexpected tragedy, such as the Exford school bus crash. The freak nature of this event and its impact on the children involved, and their families, is enormously upsetting and while challenging to report on, the public interest in such incidents is obvious. Without the the Exford school bus crash and the the Exford school bus crash who put themselves at risk to rescue children trapped on the bus, the situation could have been worse. We should also be thankful for people like Warwick Teague and Joanne Grindlay and their trauma and emergency teams that responded to the seriously injured children. the Exford school bus crash gives a rare insight into how the medical teams handled the incident at the Royal Children’s Hospital.\\n While all of our journalists are expected to respond to fast-moving events with speed and accuracy, we have a team of breaking news reporters, bloggers and digital producers who are our first responders in these situations. They are trained to move quickly, with accuracy, to update you on developments via our digital platforms. The skill of these journalists is such that they can verify, produce and distribute a story to you in the time it takes a hygienic person to clean their teeth.\\n Some of these names you will know. Caroline Schelle is our morning blogger and uses her shrewd judgement to turn the relentless stream of national news into Caroline Schelle with skill, speed and accuracy. Our breaking reporters, such as the talented Caroline Schelle, will hit the phones to verify news tips or be dispatched to the scene to file “colour” to add texture to a story.\\n They are ably supported by a host of people whose names you probably don’t know. Our news director, Katie Bice, sets the priorities and identifies the right journalist for the job. Our digital editor, Daniella Miletic coordinates the production and delivery of stories online, finessing headlines and selecting the right images, with the help of our excellent digital production team. Homepage, newsletter and social media editors then set about making sure that story is delivered to you.\\n Sometimes, this happens in seconds. Yesterday, chief football writer Jake Niall called me with a big story, confirming that Alastair Clarkson had stepped away from his coaching role at North Melbourne to look after his wellbeing. Minutes later, for many of you, the first version of that story arrived in your pocket with a buzz or a ding.\\n Even now, as I write this, another resignation has taken many by surprise. Host of the ABC’s Q+A program and veteran broadcaster Stan Grant has just stepped down from his role, citing racist abuse amid complaints about the public broadcaster’s coverage of the coronation of King Charles. A discussion between relevant editors is flowing in the newsroom, considering how to cover the story and whose insights might be most valuable to our readers. We didn’t see this one coming, but we’re doing our best to bring you the news quickly, with nuance and thoughtfulness.\\n Journalists are superstitious people. Simply uttering phrases like “slow news day” or “it’s really quiet” can conjure up any manner of disasters, according to newsroom mythology. In spite of this faux fear, the buzz of a room full of journalists working as a pack in pursuit of a developing story can be an awesome thing to behold. Contrary to one of the more negative perceptions that exist about our industry, The Age’s reporters invariably do so with sensitivity, respect and caution, keeping the public interest at the heart of every question.\\n Speed is certainly not everything. Accuracy is prized above all else in our newsroom. We don’t always do things perfectly in fast-moving situations, but we aim to. I couldn’t think of a team better equipped for that task than the “breaking desk” at The Age.\\n That brings me to my final point about the inherent messiness of news, the one that will really make you think and change your perspective …\\n Wait, sorry, another story.

       "  'headline': 'Awkward and cringy – Post Malone performs at Melbourne Showgrounds',\n",
       "  'description': 'MUSIC\\nPost Malone ★\\nMelbourne Showgrounds, November 30\\n Red fireworks burst into the sky like flares at sea, as rain showers down on a sold-out crowd waiting to see American rapper Post Malone.\\n A group of fans are rejected from the golden circle, the central pit in front of the stage. They complain as they’re ushered behind a tree roughly a hundred metres from the area they’d purchased tickets for.\\n The same happens to another group, who show me their tickets but have also been issued the wrong wristband. Another group returns from the ticket booth, having complained about their tickets. They say they are told there are no more golden circle wristbands so they’re relegated to general admission. These fans paid hundreds of dollars. They’ve travelled for hours to be here.\\n A Live Nation spokeswoman on Friday denied golden circle tickets were oversold. “We had ample wristbands printed for the golden circle sales, and no issues were reported last night to the event control centre, event or site offices during the show.”\\n One of the rejected fans resists the solemn mood of his friendship group, sculling a can of beer before breaking out in a wild dance. It’s raining heavily now. The group watches the lone dancer for a moment before seeking shelter beneath the merch stands.\\n “Post Malone”, members of the crowd tell me, “is a sad character or an antihero or both.” I’m told he is an introvert, an outsider, an outcast – as if that hasn’t been the story of every rapper since the inception of hip-hop. “He’s different.” they assure me.\\n The show has the veneer of hip-hop with pop, rock and R&B drippings. The genres are scattered and messy, and it feels as though Post Malone isn’t comfortable in his own tattooed skin. Maybe that’s the point. From where we stand, the rapper can only be seen on giant pixelated screens.\\n There’s a startling distraction of more fireworks as he sings unconvincingly, “I’ve been f--kin’ hoes and poppin’ pillies / Man, I feel just like a rockstar / All my brothers got that gas / And they always be smokin’ like a Rasta.” He waves around a guitar, dances awkwardly, some find it charming, and then brings The Kid Laroi on stage to perform Bleed – which becomes the only highlight of the show.\\n The music feels like indie pop’s answer to hip-hop. I wonder if this is what the whitewashing of hip-hop culture sounds like? It’s clear, the audience can relate to his broken personality in a way I can’t.\\n In what’s meant to be a moment of catharsis, Post Malone asks a fan to join him on stage for a shoey. The shoey has become something of a motif in his shows.\\n Pouring beer into a shoe and drinking it has become a strange ritual that visiting artists are often forced into in their Australian shows.\\n It is also a stunt synonymous with First Nations UFC fighter Bam Bam Tuivasa (dubbed “shoeyvasa”), who brawls against the odds, crawling out of cage fights with blood splattered across his face before raising a Nike TN full of liquor, a Western Sydney-style toast, before throwing the sweaty drink down the hatch. It’s something of a counter-culture coronation.\\n Post Malone’s shoey isn’t anything like that. I’ve seen more gravitas in toasts of VB at the local cricket club.\\n And if it’s an attempt to connect with Australian culture, it feels about as cringy as opening a hip-hop show with Angus Stone. Angus Stone was the opening act.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. Get it every Friday.\\n'},\n",

       "  'headline': 'He played Harry Potter on stage. Now he’s out of work, and nearly out of money',\n",
       "  'description': 'Gareth Reeves played one of the most high-profile theatre roles in the world, but he has found himself back in a position depressingly familiar to all actors: the money is about to run out and there is no work on the horizon.\\n For over a thousand shows starting back in February 2019 Reeves played Harry Potter in the blockbuster Melbourne production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\\n Cursed Child closed just under two weeks ago, after several lockdowns and selling over a million tickets, but it will take some time for Reeves’ body to unlearn the muscle memory it has created. “I woke up in the middle of the night two nights ago doing the show, apparently,” he says.\\n Playing the one role for so long is highly unusual and Reeves knew this from the outset.\\n “[Normally] you do your three to six weeks season – or longer if you’re doing a tour – and then crash and get the flu and fall apart and then get up and madly scramble around for the next gig,” he explains. “My whole life [as an actor] I’ve always kind of hovered around this sort of $20-$30,000 a year kind of income.”\\n So, when he was cast as Harry Potter he knew it was a chance that might not come again. “Going into it one of my first thoughts was ‘OK, this might be the only time in my life I have a full-time job’,” he says.“So, we were like, OK, we have to be smart about this. How can we maximise the opportunity?”\\n Reeves took out a home loan and built the kind of financial buffer that is rarely possible for actors. In two months, however, that buffer will run out and he will return to familiar territory – trying to pay the bills any way he can and not knowing what acting job comes next.\\n “I’m looking at training as a marriage celebrant and helping out a friend who’s setting up a small business,” he says. “That’s about all I’ve got in the pipeline at the moment.” \\n While Reeves threw himself into playing Harry Potter and found the experience deeply satisfying, he also knew that when things finished he would be returning to the hustle that goes hand in hand with being an actor.\\n “In terms of career ... I’m under no illusions that playing Harry Potter is going to open any doors for me. I think, if anything while I’ve been doing this, a bunch of doors have probably closed and I have to go back and start banging on them again.”\\n He says it’s an interesting time to find himself out of work, pointing to the Hollywood writers and actors strike. “We’re all watching very closely,” he says.\\n Something the strike has put into sharp relief is that a big break doesn’t necessarily mean financial security, or an increased likelihood of work in the future. More often than not, once that role wraps up, you’re back where you started.\\n “It took me years, even as an actor to figure that out” says Reeves. “I had friends who would get a big gig and you were like, ‘Well, off they go they’re loaded now’. But that isn’t the reality, at least not any more.”\\n He points to streaming services in particular – even if actors land a role in something high profile and well regarded, “it’s only once it becomes popular and starts repeating that you and your team can then start to kind of push and negotiate for a bit more”.\\n “No one’s set for life anymore, that’s for sure.”\\n “As you get older, and you have families or you get a gig that enables you to buy a house … this is one of the main times that people start dropping off,” says Reeves. “They just get jack of it and start to see the advantages of having a job where you can be home at night with your families and be around on the weekends to see people, and to be able to know that that money is coming in regularly and know how much it’s going be.\\n “Harry was a real outlier – it was a large Broadway-musical-scale play with movement, and there aren’t many of those. I always knew that it was going to be a one off.\\n “I’ve got this little window of time just to breathe and heal and find out who I am now [while] trying to stave off the terror because I have absolutely no work or gigs lined up at all, not through lack of trying – but I’m working on it,” he says with a small laugh.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'headline': 'Eye-catching debut for the futuristic festival aiming to transform the city',\n",
       "  'description': 'Over the past three weekends, Melbourne’s major new arts festival Now or Never made its dizzying debut. With a focus on the future of technology, it sits in a crowded field of high-concept, brand-intensive, publicly funded festivals including RISING, Vivid and Dark Mofo (which is privately owned but receives public funds). So, where does it land?\\n Now or Never is a consolidation of Melbourne Music Week and Melbourne Knowledge Week and continues MMW’s tradition of reinvigorating under-utilised civic spaces. For its marquee venue, Now or Never staged major contemporary music performances in the Royal Exhibition Building for the first time in more than 20 years.\\n Inside, a dazzling, 16-metre-high semi-transparent LED screen (inspired by a similar, social media famous installation in the London super-club Printworks) was the backdrop for highlights including Orchestra Victoria’s hypnotic rendition of minimalist composer Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians; anarchic modular techno by the Bristol duo Giant Swan; and a community-affirming celebration of Queer artistry headlined by the pre-eminent experimental US R&B artist, Kelela. Concerns around the building’s hard, reflective surfaces proved unwarranted – the room sounds fantastic.\\n Now or Never’s series of talks from scientists, artists and designers underpinned its performances. In a keynote speech, the London-based social entrepreneur and architect, Indy Johar, proposed a complete reorganisation of governance, the economy and our relationship to the land we live on to ensure humanity’s survival. If we do as Johar says, how should a city’s publicly funded festivals reflect that change? What’s their purpose, and who should they serve?\\n RISING opted to empower artists with its bold programming and initially chose a smaller number of thematically more complex free public artworks than White Night, the increasingly unmanageable festival it replaced. But arguably, RISING alienated the broad audience White Night amassed in the process. Now or Never took note and presented a free 1.2-kilometre Docklands Art Trail; a thematically accessible 360-degree full-dome cinema presentation in its Neversphere; and SACRA – an epic, RISING alienated the broad audience White Night amassed in the process.\\n Now or Never’s NONSTOP WKND (formerly MMW’s Live Music Safari) was a crucial social leveller. Affordable day passes (reduced in price at the eleventh hour) gave audiences access to 70 artists performing at 13 shows, in six Melbourne venues. In shadowy rooms vibrating with bass, attendees let loose without hyper-specialised knowledge of a medium’s in-jokes or conventions.\\n Walking into one of the city’s beloved band rooms one could find singer Georgie Darvidis belting out John Farnham’s You’re the Voice in the style of Björk; the performance artist Mara Gallagher, spotlit on a milk crate podium being buffeted by leaf blowers; the DJ Adriana supporting Pontic Greek folk dancers; and the Honduran DJ Low Jack upending a club with Britney Spears edits and Central American dance genres, including electro Latino and zouk bass.\\n Now or Never’s opening party at Max Watts featured exclusively First Peoples DJs, and the festival opened its events with a message supporting the Voice to parliament. But those overtures ring hollow when First Peoples performers are only given opening, interstitial or back-up slots at the festival’s flagship Royal Exhibition Building venue; just two First Peoples artists in its Docklands Art Trail; and one film in the Neversphere.\\n As confirmed to The Age by the festival, NONSTOP WKND included international and local performers with Nigerian, Serbian, Indonesian, Japanese, Colombian, Chilean, Hong Kong, Angolan, Black American and Mauritian heritages – but none of the 70 acts at NONSTOP WKND were from First Peoples communities.\\n The festival included some First Peoples representation in smaller events and talks, but the absence was felt at Now or Never’s mass-attendance program pieces. Representation matters in what context it happens as well as how often.\\n In a flicker of hope, Now or Never has already presented a template to help it fix the imbalance in subsequent years at Never Permanent, its day-long conference co-presented with Semi-Permanent. The day’s sole First Peoples speaker (the speakers in general came from a wide range of backgrounds), the AI researcher, designer and entrepreneur Professor Angie Abdilla, a Palawa woman, presented her Country-centred Design philosophy.\\n Abdilla’s concept places care for Country and community at the heart of decision-making: When it comes to the consultation process, who is asking the questions? Is the work interrupting an important cultural practice or enhancing it? Does the work holistically benefit the community in which it’s taking place? Many of these concepts sync with Johar’s thoughts, too.\\n Now or Never’s futurist thematic undertaking is both a challenge and opportunity. The City of Melbourne, the festival and its directors are on the cusp of creating something extraordinary that caters to academics and aesthetes, while engaging and challenging a broad audience, too – but only if it practises what it preaches year-on-year. If Now or Never can look to the future, while meaningfully incorporating the practical knowledge systems that have existed here for tens of thousands of years, it will have something truly unique within its grasp.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'headline': 'Judith Lucy takes on one of the most demanding roles in modern theatre',\n",
       "  'description': 'THEATRE\\nHappy Days ★★★½\\nSamuel Beckett, Melbourne Theatre Company, until June 10\\n For decades, Judith Lucy has cultivated the curled lip and sardonic wit of the jaded urbanite, perfecting the art of acidic feminist snark. Her comedy is, above all, knowing. Winnie in Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days is a very different creature. There’s a lot to unknow to fully realise one of the most demanding parts in modern drama.\\n Winnie is in deep shit. Sand, actually – first up to her waist, then her neck – on a hellishly hot day in a vast desert landscape, after some unnamed apocalypse. (To a contemporary audience, climate change presents itself as the inescapable suggestion.)\\n She has only her faceless husband Willie (Hayden Spencer) for company, and he mostly ignores her.\\n Such a hopeless situation would make most of us want to curl up and die – or at least bitterly complain. Not Winnie. She ignores the gun within arm’s reach and gets on with her day. Puts on lippy. Brushes her teeth. Files her nails. She prattles. Gives herself little pep talks. Makes one-sided stabs at conversation with Willie. Half-remembers fragments of the Psalms and Shakespeare. Counts blessings and mercies.\\n Winnie’s radical optimism scales the cliff of the present by using that exotic grammatical tense, the future perfect. “This will have been,” she repeats after any memorable event in her existence, “a happy day”.\\n Audiences may find themselves admiring Lucy’s tenacity, barracking for the underdog, and relishing some inspired passages of play in this unconventional interpretation. But accomplished histrionic technique? Command of the musicality of the language? A breath-catching, effortlessly inhabited Winnie whose unyielding, half-ingenuous act of self-assertion at once doggedly resists and helplessly succumbs to distinctly feminine forms of self-erasure? No, not really.\\n What we get isn’t exactly unimpressive.\\n Despite the plastered smile, Winnie is channelled in part through Lucy’s irrepressible comic persona. It’s a deliberately spiky performance with a much stronger passive-aggressive streak than the role usually receives, and can be funnier for that, especially in the low-key marital stand-off with Willie, and in meta-theatrical moments.\\n Lucy’s elastic and expressive face, aided by shadowy lighting design, also makes her neck-up performance a tormented battleground against evanescence – achieving if not outright poignancy, then at least a strangely familiar desolation, punctuated by sharp notes of suppressed anger.\\n Whether Winnie can rage against the dying of the light in quite this way without compromising the aching fragility behind her resilience, I’m not sure.\\n And maybe director Petra Kalive could have risked cracking this classic wide open to contemporary feminist challenge, by striking a consistent, and entirely self-conscious, anachronistic tone.\\n Given the scale of the task faced here, this is a valiant performance, unconstrained by tradition, that brings fresh insights to the work a play every theatre lover should want to see.\\n It’s obvious Judith Lucy has the talent and creative intelligence for a stage acting career, and if Joanna Murray-Smith wrote a play for her, I’d see it in a heartbeat.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'headline': 'One man and his dog: The lonely task of writing an opera',\n",
       "  'description': 'In a second-storey room of a Brunswick building I must have walked past dozens of times without noticing, Richard Mills is creating music.\\n Books are stacked neatly around the place, a piano stands off to one side, a desk is strewn with papers, and curled up on a chair is the accomplished composer and conductor’s dog, Buddy, who is his constant companion through the process of writing an opera from scratch.\\n Walking Buddy, who is one of the loveliest dogs you’ll ever meet, and getting a coffee are the two main breaks from writing Mills takes. The rest of the time he is immersed in the musical world he is creating.\\n “Writing music is really hard work. It takes time and concentration, and it takes isolation,” he says. “You can’t be talking to people – you’ve got to sit and do it quietly away from outside influences.”\\n When we meet, Mills is in the process of composing Galileo, a new work that will also mark his final production as artistic director of Victorian Opera after 11 years in the role. He will, however, be staying close to music. It’s impossible, he agrees, to ever retire from a vocation.\\n Though he is wrapping up his tenure, his passion for the art form is just as fiery as ever. He’s steadfast about the importance of opera and, while proud of what Victorian Opera has been contributing, feels that is a significant distance between where we are and where we should be in the art form as a state.\\n “Opera’s part of that continuum of the imagination – and a society without imagination has no future,” he says. “It happens to contain some of the greatest thoughts penned by human beings … It opens a window on the marvellous to a community … it creates opportunities to see the world in a different way.”\\n Every Victorian Opera program balances past and present, with an emphasis on spotlighting local talent both on the stage and behind the pen. “We were doing everything … this state government’s wanted to do long before they even published an arts policy, because it’s the right thing to do. I mean, we should be working with First Nations, we should be responsible to our community, we should be doing education. We should be doing accessible, meaningful work for families. We’re doing all of that – we always have. ”\\n That said, he feels there is more that could be done. “Every city that aspires to be an important centre has an opera company – and Melbourne should have a properly articulated state company at about $10 or $12 million a year. That would serve the city well, and the whole community,” says Mills.\\n At present, while Victoria has several local opera companies, there isn’t a dedicated state opera with that level of funding. Instead the role is filled in part by Victorian Opera, which was founded in 2005 and currently receives about $4.8 million in local and federal funding, and in part by Opera Australia, which formed when the Victoria State Opera merged with the Australian Opera in 1996 but is not Victoria-focused.\\n Mills also has his eye on the bigger picture beyond Victorian Opera. His views are firm and clear: pathways for young musicians and composers have become more tortuous and opaque, venues for performance are inadequate, government funding for performing arts is inadequate and spaces for emerging artists to experiment and create have all but disappeared.\\n “I feel incredibly fortunate when I was starting out as a young composer,” he says. “I’m not a great composer, I’m a good craftsman … I was lucky to be given opportunities at a time when it was much easier,” he says.\\n “The orchestras in those days were not run as businesses. They were broadcasting orchestras. So they had a lot of time to play Australian music.”\\n He has spoken before about how badly Melbourne needs its own opera house, and when asked about this – and where it should go – he doesn’t hesitate. “Fishermans Bend. It’s going to be a major hub.” He explains how a few years back he started work on a design made of shipping containers, then worked with Alan Pert from the University of Melbourne’s design school to work on a mock-up for another idea. “A 1200 seater.”\\n At present, Victorian Opera performs at the Palais and the Arts Centre. “The trouble with the Arts Centre is it would cost $250,000 a fortnight and it’s just too big. Opera needs to be on a human scale. In a resonant space, the voice sounds beautiful,” he says. “The Arts Centre, of course, is full of carpet [and] carpet’s a natural enemy of voice.”\\n The venue issue extends beyond companies like Victorian Opera needing places to perform finished work, he emphasises.\\n “There’s no sandpit in Melbourne for the younger generation, the emerging generation, to make stuff and try things,” he says.\\n “Barrie Kosky, when he first started out, made shows and put them on in garages, in service stations, but … we’ve destroyed all those old industrial spaces that the young practitioners could rent. It’s why the whole Fishermans Bend thing is incredibly important, because this city needs a sandpit – it needs a place for emerging talent to manifest itself without punitive cost structures.”\\n Mills is grateful for the time and space he had in his musical education to hone his craft, and this week his newest work, Galileo, has its concert premiere at the Palais.\\n He was drawn to the story of the Italian polymath because “it seems to me that it is a story for our time”.\\n Galileo was a pioneer in the field of astronomy whose work found him tried by the Roman Inquisition and falling out of favour with the pope. His final years were spent under house arrest.\\n Even so, Mills was repeatedly asked why Galileo – why not Giordano Bruno? “It’s much more dramatic because Bruno was burned as a heretic,” he says. But for Mills, the story that can be woven from Galileo’s life is “much more nuanced and much more dimensional”. He was drawn in by the complexity.\\n “It’s a story about the search for truth, and the meaning of truth. It’s the relation of truth and politics. It’s also a story about a spiritual quest. It’s a story about the possibility of faith. It’s a story about all of this taking place in a constantly shifting environment that was, you know, negotiating the plague. Think about it. What’s changed?”\\n Galileo, a new opera in concert, will be performed by Victorian Opera on December 20 at the Palais Theatre.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'It’s a near-impossible task, but the finished list is worth the struggle. In compiling Netflix’s 20 essential shows, I had a few simple parameters: scripted only (no documentaries or reality fare), mix the signature hits with the lesser-known, and recognise the breadth of the streaming service’s programming. Your favourite show might not be here, then again neither is mine.\\n Beef\\n Starting with a road rage incident and escalating to vengeful pranks, this black farce about a pair of Los Angeles residents – played by Ali Wong and Steven Yeun – appears to be a barbed contemporary comedy, but scene by scene it goes deeper into the characters, their failings, and ultimately their connection. It is a masterful, arresting transformation.\\n Black Mirror\\n Charlie Brooker’s science-fiction anthology debuted 12 years ago, which means that some of the dystopian concepts he built each season’s handful of episodes around no longer feel like mordant speculation. But the best episodes – start with San Junipero – still resonate in ways both fascinating and fearful, and the show’s evolution is fascinating to trace.\\n Bodyguard\\n Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio pushed his talent for tense thrillers punctuated by whiplash reveals to the limits with this limited series about a British personal protection officer and traumatised war veteran (Richard Madden, in his finest performance) assigned to a hard-as-nails cabinet minister (Keeley Hawes). The dynamic between the two is one of many combustible elements here.\\n BoJack Horseman\\n Hollywood satires tend to be snarky and short-sighted, so naturally it took an animated series where the Los Angeles subjects are anthropomorphic animals to really twist the knife. Daft at first encounter, full of visual delights, and psychologically acute, the story of the titular equine sitcom star (perfectly voiced by Will Arnett) dug deeper across six seasons than most prestige dramas ever could.\\n Borgen\\n The definitive political drama of the 21st century, this Danish series originally aired for three seasons between 2010 and 2013, with its depiction of power – how to wield it, what it costs – gripping when intermixed with piquant characters. Netflix added a sharply drawn fourth season last year, and the show’s many telling observations remain relevant.\\n The Crown\\n The closer this historic drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II has got to the present day, the more its spell has dissipated. Nonetheless, Peter Morgan’s royal drama is one of Netflix’s signature shows and the Claire Foy and Olivia Colman eras as Her Majesty are sumptuous character studies of privilege, contradiction and immaculate insults.\\n Dark\\n Seriously, don’t be flippant with this dense German drama: you’re in for three seasons of increasingly complex narratives, as events in an orderly town are tied together through time travel patterns every 33 years. It is bleakly gripping – mournful cellos yes, humour no – as kidnapped children and temporal conspiracies abound, but its depiction of regret and inevitability is also tragically beautiful.\\n Derry Girls\\n Has there ever been a sitcom as silly and yet sublime as Lisa McGee’s ode to her 1990s high school misadventures in Northern Ireland during the final years of sectarian conflict. Historic events and being banned from the local chippy intertwine as a group of teenage girls – and their plus-one male English cousin – plot wildly and act badly. The funniest coming of age tale going.\\n The Good Place\\n A classic American network sitcom in structure – 22-minute episodes! – loaded with inventive ideas, ingenious gags and moral quandaries, the four seasons of this metaphysical comedy find a group of wayward strangers exploring the afterlife. It is in turn nutty, soulful, and stacked with note-perfect performances (take a bow, Ted Danson).\\n The Haunting of Hill House\\n Filmmaker turned showrunner Mike Flanagan is Netflix’s resident horror auteur: year after year he updates classic horror tales or modifies the genre. My pick of his limited series is the first, which matches a group of siblings’ haunted house experience as children with their experience as emotionally damaged adults. Much is terrifying here, including familial bonds.\\n Hilda\\n Gorgeously animated – words to the effect of “Hayao Miyazaki in Scandinavia” are rightfully found in many reviews – the two seasons of this children’s series follow the adventures of the titular 11-year-old (voiced by The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey). The tone can be bittersweet or chaotic, as Hilda’s outings go from the mundane to the fantastical and she begins to comprehend the wider world’s flaws.\\n I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson\\n After three seasons of this genius sketch comedy series, it’s got to the point where I laugh so uncontrollably hard that my oldest son simply calls out “Tim Robinson” from another room. Absurd but always a step ahead of your expectations, Robinson’s pieces explore the extremes of social limits.\\n Monty Python’s Flying Circus\\n Tom Robinson, and many other sketch comics, wouldn’t have a career if it wasn’t for this feted troupe of British comics. Netflix has all four seasons of their BBC show, which debuted in 1969 and paved the way for their classic film comedies, and while time and a changing society has shaded certain numbers, there is still one-of-a-kind brilliance here.\\n Mindhunter\\n When the two circles on your Venn diagram are filmmaker David Fincher and infamous serial killers of the 1970s, you’re in for an intense series. A study of detail and dread, this impeccable psychological thriller follows a pair of outlier FBI agents and a female psychology professor interviewing jailed mass murderers such as Son of Sam.\\n Never Have I Ever\\n Netflix recently wrapped up, with a satisfying mix of teenage realisation and timeless awkwardness, this coming-of-age comic-drama, as Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and her pals finished high school. Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher’s show was always funny, but it grew more perceptive about its Indian-American lead and the rigours of adolescence with each season. Bonus: an amazing celebrity narrator.\\n Seinfeld\\n The era-defining sitcoms of the 1990s are lucrative trophies in the streaming era, with Netflix currently home to all 180 episodes of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David’s celebrated comedy about a group of New Yorkers with the worst of intentions. Riffing off minor misunderstandings and friendly misdemeanours, this 20th century classic has episodes assembled with clockwork precision and hilarious send-offs.\\n Squid Game\\n The games without frontiers that punctuated this shocking and addictive drama turned Netflix’s South Korean production arm from stealth success to superstar. With a harsh undercurrent of inequality fuelling the fantastical limits, a group of strangers find themselves in an underground competition where children’s games are literally a matter of life and death.\\n Stateless\\n A funding arrangement means that Netflix ends up taking the ABC’s scripted shows to the world, while providing a valuable second chance locally. It means you can rediscover this coruscating 2020 drama about Australia’s refugee detention regime, with co-creator Cate Blanchett in a supporting role.

       "  'headline': 'PwC behind 15 schemes to sidestep tax, says ATO',\n",
       "  'description': 'PwC was behind 15 schemes designed to help multinationals sidestep tax laws, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan told a parliamentary committee late on Tuesday.\\n Mr Jordan also accused PwC of frustrating its investigations into these types of schemes – which, in total, put at risk $180 million in tax revenue a year – via “false claims” of legal privilege.\\n The ATO learnt that PwC partner Peter Collins had used confidential Treasury information to develop the schemes in late 2017.\\n This was months before Mr Collins, signed the last of three confidentiality agreements to consult on the new tax laws, in February 2018 when Treasury did not know about the ATO’s discovery.\\n Second tax commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn said the ATO had the first hints in late 2017 that Mr Collins had breached confidentiality.\\n “By the start of 2019 we actually took an assistant commissioner offline…with a team of 20 or so staff were solely focused on dealing with these matters.”\\n But Mr Jordan said the ATO was prevented by outdated secrecy laws from informing the Treasurer of these developments.\\n The commissioner named three PwC clients that were involved in claims for legal privilege.\\n “The three companies… were all PwC clients that we’ve taken to the court and are public and that’s why we can mention Glencore... ABi InBev and JBS, the Brazilian meat processing [company],” Mr Jordan said.\\n In another development, Peter van Dongen, the former chairman of PwC’s board, and Paul Abbey, a tax partner at the firm, have both been removed from a website listing the firm’s governance board members, indicating they may have stepped down. The firm would not comment on the changes.\\n Earlier on Tuesday, officials from Treasury fielded a barrage of questions about their ongoing relationship with PwC, when they learned of the tax leaks and what they have done in response to the scandal. Defence officials were also grilled about the 54 contracts the department had with PwC, worth more than $223 million.\\n In his opening statement, Mr Jordan told the committee that the ATO became aware of a handful of multinationals trying to avoid the new laws in early 2016, which triggered audits.\\n “In January 2016, we became aware of a handful of multinationals suspiciously and quickly attempting to restructure their affairs upon the introduction of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL),” Mr Jordan said.\\n “Within days of becoming aware, we commenced reviews and audits of those multinationals and issued three Taxpayer Alerts in 2016, putting all significant firms and taxpayers on notice.\\n “Our immediate action prevented any loss of revenue to the Commonwealth from a scheme to avoid the MAAL. We estimate the revenue at risk was $180 million annually.”\\n AFP advice sought in 2018 Mr Jordan also detailed how the Tax Office shared information with federal police in 2018 about Mr Collins leaking confidential Treasury documents.\\n This means the decision by Treasury head Dr Steven Kennedy to refer the PwC tax leaks scandal to the AFP is the second time the police have been called in over the matter.\\n Federal Police commissioner Reece Kershaw made no reference to the earlier consultation when questioned about the PwC matter at estimates last Thursday. The federal police decided to take no further action in 2019.\\n An AFP spokesperson said that the ATO only provided “representative sample documents” for assessment.\\n “The AFP assessed, based on the material that the ATO provided, was that there was insufficient information in the material, to support a formal referral,” the spokesperson said. “In consultation and agreement with the ATO, the matter was closed in 2019.”\\n Later, in July 2020, the Tax Office formally referred the matter to Tax Practitioners Board, which investigates members of the tax profession.\\n Mr Jordan also provided a timeline that showed that the ATO obtained a cache of PwC internal emails in late 2017, which showed that Mr Collins had shared confidential Treasury documents that he received with other PwC partners, who then used the information to target new clients.\\n It’s not clear which part of the ATO first obtained the emails, but their existence appears not to have been widely known in the tax regulator.\\n As a result, Mr Collins – who signed his first confidentiality agreement with Treasury in 2013 – continued to act as an adviser to Treasury on plans for new anti avoidance laws.\\n “Unlike many revenue authorities in other countries, we do not have criminal investigative powers. As the confidentiality breach was not a tax offence, we were unable to investigate the matter further and from 2018 we sought to refer this matter to the correct authority,” Mr Jordan said.\\n ‘Circling like vultures’ Earlier in the day, Greens Senator David Shoebridge said it appeared PwC had been “circling like vultures” trying to win defence contracts. He said Defence was “far and away” PwC’s biggest government client, with contracts worth eight times more than the next nearest department.\\n The department’s associate secretary, Matt Yannopoulos, defended the volume of work that PwC had won, saying the military was undergoing a significant recapitalisation with new weapons and platforms.\\n “We are the largest project delivery organisation in the Commonwealth,” Mr Yannopoulos said. Mr Yannopoulos said PwC had twice offered written assurances that the 54 staff whose names have not been made public did not work on defence contracts.\\n On Monday, PwC acting chief executive Kristin Stubbins announced nine partners would go on leave pending further investigation, as part of a suite of measures to show the firm was taking decisive action over the tax leaks scandal. Ms Stubbins also announced that chairman Tracey Kennair and governance board risk chairman Paddy Carney had decided to step down from their roles\\n The nine partners were not named but are understood to include former executive board members Pete Calleja and Sean Gregory. The pair had earlier stepped down from their leadership roles at the firm. Separately from these nine partners, the firm has already announced former chief executive Tom Seymour will retire early from the firm in September.\\n With Andrew Tillett, Lois Maskiell and Campbell Kwan\\n'},\n",

       "  'headline': 'Who will be Australia’s first poet laureate? (And what does that actually mean?)',\n",
       "  'description': 'Australia has had only one poet laureate. That was a former convict, Michael Massey Robinson, who was appointed by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in the early 19th century to write odes for royal birthdays. He received a couple of cows from the government herd for his trouble.\\n His Ode for the Queen’s Birthday, 1814 included the immortal lines: “ILLUSTRIOUS QUEEN! exalted WIFE! / Ador’d thro’ ev’ry Stage of Life / By Nature’s Impulse taught to share / THY CONSORT’s ling’ring Hours of Care.”\\n Two centuries the position of poet laureate is set to be revived under the federal government’s new national cultural policy. In 2025 Australia will join the likes of the US, New Zealand, UK, Canada, Jamaica, Nigeria and appoint an official poet laureate.\\n But what does a poet laureate do? In Britain, the job is a royal appointment on advice from the Prime Minister and the chosen poet commemorates royal occasions as well as working on their own projects. The current poet laureate, Simon Armitage, marked the death of Queen Elizabeth II with Floral Tribute, which came shortly after he wrote Queenhood to mark her platinum jubilee: “A priceless freight for a young woman to bear / but, draped and adorned, a monarch walks forward / into the sideways weather of oncoming years.”\\n Sarah Holland-Batt is an award-winning poet and Professor of Creative Writing & Literary Studies at the Queensland University of Technology, who advocated for Australia to have a poet laureate in her submission to the national cultural policy and read her poem The Gift at the announcement of the policy in Melbourne on Monday. She says the person chosen would promote poetry generally and connect it more with the public.\\n “An Australian poet laureate would elevate the status of Australian poetry domestically and internationally ,” Holland-Batt says. “Australian literature can struggle on the world stage so there would be a soft diplomacy element to it.”\\n She said the laureate would be an advocate for Australia and Australian writing and the benefits would be beyond only poetry.\\n “It would be a big boost for Australian literature to have someone with that authority invested by the state.”\\n But she also said the office should not be too prescribed:“There should be the leeway for each poet to do what they want. There would have to be a degree of trust.”\\n Peter Rose, poet and editor of Australian Book Review, one of the country’s leading literary magazines, said Australia needed a poet laureate.\\n “Other literary cultures have had them for centuries, ” he says. “We see all the benefits in those positions. But they must have considerable freedom and budget. It’s a great opportunity to present poetry to the public in a way that may demystify it to the public.”\\n Rose said the appointment would be crucial, but doesn’t know the criteria would be for selection.\\n “I don’t think it should be a lifetime achievement award. It should be a real communicator, someone who can convey poetry to non-readers. It’s important for it to go to people with a real record and commitment to public education. Someone with a real hunger to counter the sense that poetry is too difficult, or the most elite form of literature, someone of considerable charm and eloquence.”\\n So who should it be? Holland-Batt said it should be a distinguished person, someone who has obviously published poetry but also written about poetry and engaged with the poetry of others. And significantly, someone who could respond to public events. “Occasional poems are really difficult to write,” she said.\\n Lyn McCredden, emeritus professor of creative writing and literary studies at Deakin University, said she hoped whoever is chosen was someone who could speak to people, to celebrate and be positive. “I don’t want someone who is oblique and full of misery,” she says.\\n She said there were a lot of Indigenous poets and younger poets using language in a vibrant and contemporary way. “It should be someone who has breadth and a sense of the diversity of the Australian people and a sense of the land. It is about making us proud and also correcting our blindness and speaking to new possibilities.”\\n Poets who may be up for consideration in a selection process yet to be determined include David Malouf, Ali Cobby Eckerman, Evelyn Araluen, Judith Beveridge, John Kinsella, Lachlan Brown, Adam Aitken, as well as other award winners or prolific poets.\\n The title of poet laureate dates back to classical Greece and Rome when poets were presented with a crown of laurel leaves in honour of Apollo, the god of poetry. In Britain, the position was created in 1668 with John Dryden the first royal appointment. Alfred, Lord Tennyson held the office for more than 40 years in the 19th century, but now poets serve a 10-year fixed term. Carol-Ann Duffy was the first woman in the position, with Armitage succeeding her in 2019.\\n The US created the office in 1936 and since 1986 the laureate is also the consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. The current laureate, Ada Limon, is obliged to give one lecture and read her work at the library, but is free to work on her own writing. But many US states and cities also have poets laureate, as do Canadian provinces. In Canada the laureate is obliged to write in French and English; the current holder is Louise Bernice Halfe.\\n The New Zealand position was first established in 1997, by a winery, but 10 years later the national Library took over the running. Chris Tse is the current laureate.\\n When Andrew Motion attended the Sydney Writers’ Festival in May 1999 news leaked that he was to be Britain’s new poet laureate. But what surprised Motion most was not that he had been chosen – he knew his name was up for consideration - but the interest shown in Australia. Now that interest can turn to our own poet laureate.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. Get it delivered every Friday.\\n'},\n",

       "  'headline': 'The two women shaking up the idea of what makes good theatre',\n",
       "  'description': 'When musical director, multi-instrumentalist, composer, cabaret artist and artistic director Victoria Falconer was growing up, she knew she wanted to star in a musical.\\n “Musicals seemed the appropriate place for a big show-off who loved playing lots of instruments and singing and titting around generally,” she says. “But it was very rare to see myself represented on stage.”\\n So rare that Falconer, who has Philippine and British heritage, and is co-artistic director at Sydney’s Hayes Theatre (with Richard Carroll), stopped trying to work in the world of musicals and instead jumped into cabaret and physical theatre.\\n “I lived in fringe-land,” she says. “I wanted to bring in different influences, play around with form, the kind of stuff you get from having an interesting, diverse childhood and a family of two different cultures.\\n “Musicals didn’t seem like the place for that. So I went away and lived in fringe-land, which more than welcomes that kind of work.”\\n Falconer’s work in independent theatre has seen her: win two best cabaret artist awards at the Adelaide Fringe; score a nomination for best musical direction at the Sydney Theatre Awards (for Once); take on the role of musical director on musicals Lizzie and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes; and co-create and host the sold-out Sydney Festival work Smashed - The Brunch Party.\\n “Now I’m back and it’s exactly what musical theatre wants,” she says. “It feels like even the most mainstream of audiences are interested in not only seeing stories that reflect themselves, but also reflect the other people that they know and love around them.”\\n That philosophy drives the programming at Hayes Theatre, an independent company that makes new and traditional musical theatre with a vast and diverse array of creative people. Falconer attributes part of that ethos to her background.\\n “People of colour, creatives of colour, we’ve worked from a place of deficit for so long, that having to find inventive, exciting ways to do stuff means that our work is exciting,” she says.\\n “I know that that’s a huge generalisation. But we work outside of the borders anyway. We have to find ways around the rules to do things. Not just with telling our stories, but with how we actually put them on stage. So play is part of that culture of telling you stories.”\\n Catherine Van-Davies, co-artistic director at Sydney’s Old Fitz Theatre (with Alexander Berlage and Constantine Costi), agrees. The Vietnamese Australian actor says one of the main tenets of programming at the Old Fitz is “de-centring” ideas of what makes good theatre.\\n “We need to burst open concepts of what theatre is,” she says. “Encompass many multidisciplinary approaches to it and many makers from different walks of life. That immediately asks the audience to start opening themselves up to receiving stories differently.\\n “For those from marginalised communities, or historically underrepresented communities, we operate in a constant state of translation with the stories that are provided to us.\\n “So we become multilingual in an emotional sense, in a cultural sense, in a huge array of ways, and that is an exciting thing to offer to audiences, because they also have the capacity to do the same thing.”\\n Falconer and Van-Davies are leading some of the most diverse, original and inventive programming in Sydney theatre, from their relatively small independent companies.\\n They are as passionate about spearheading change as they are about supporting and creating work that upends traditional boundaries in theatre.\\n Neither dismisses older or conventionally traditional works. Nor do they believe progressive or cutting-edge performance requires a one-size-fits-all approach.\\n But both, along with their artistic director colleagues, want their theatres, and theatre generally, to burst at the seams with diversity, opportunity and perspectives that break theatre conventions.\\n “We don’t want to just be mimicking what subsidised theatres can do,” Van-Davies says. “We want to be offering a space in which artists can be true to their vision, without compromise. Enable them to take bold and risky offers, to delve into their practice in a deeper and more experimental way.\\n “Because of the many costs involved in the larger state theatre companies, they can’t take those kinds of risks.\\n “We want artists to have a really clear, open voice in our spaces. And that’s naturally going to bring in voices from less represented communities, I think.”\\n At the Old Fitz, overseen by Red Line Productions, the diversity of work has ranged from Chewing Gum Dreams by UK playwright Michaela Coel (I May Destroy You) to New Balance‘s stories of the queer, disabled experience; Cheryn Frost’s experimental work Volcanoes & Vulvas; and Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Alexander Berlage and featuring Van-Davies as Stella.\\n Hayes has recently programmed Lizzie, director Maeve Marsden’s “queer grunge” take on the story of Lizzie Borden, a theatre adaptation of Gentleman Prefer Blondes, new Laura Murphy (Bell Shakespeare’s The Lovers) musical Zombie, and The Lucky Country, with music and lyrics by composer and Six the Musical star Vidya Makan.\\n Falconer, who was named one of the 40 under 40 most influential Asian-Australians for 2022, for her leadership in arts and culture, is also a founding member of The People of Cabaret, an initiative that advocates for artists of colour.\\n Falconer and Van-Davies agree programming new theatre, whether fresh takes on old work or experimental pieces with little precedent, doesn’t mean tearing apart the rulebook.\\n “Using the rules to destabilise a little bit is often enough, because it means that it’s also not too threatening,” Falconer says.\\n Van-Davies reiterates the need to support artists.\\n “I want artists to feel uncompromised,” she says. “I want them to feel like they have a place in this world, even if they’ve not seen it reflected back previously.\\n “Theatre is an ecosystem and I want them to have their voice in it.”\\n A Streetcar Named Desire is at Old Fitz Theatre until July 1.

       "  'headline': 'Curtis Sittenfeld’s celebrity romcom didn’t sweep me off my feet',\n",
       "  'description': 'Curtis Sittenfeld likes to pose questions with her novels. What if Hillary had refused to marry Bill? (Rodham.) What if Pride and Prejudice was set in contemporary times? (Eligible.) Why did Democrat-raised librarian Laura Bush marry boisterous Republican George W? (American Wife.)\\n There’s an entertainment tradition of ordinary looking talented men pairing with spectacularly beautiful women. But it would never happen if the genders were reversed – would it? That’s the premise of Sittenfeld’s sixth novel.\\n Sally Milner is a writer for TNO, a fictional Saturday Night Live. When her colleague Danny becomes engaged to a gorgeous celebrity, Sally writes a mocking sketch – The Danny Horst Rule – embodying the novel’s premise. That week, as she helps “cheesily handsome” pop-star guest host Noah write his own sketch, she feels an attraction spark. But it can’t be mutual – can it?\\n The narrative tension, as with any romantic comedy, lies not in whether an attraction exists, or even if it will be consummated, so much as how that will happen, and the specifics of the obstacles they’ll overcome. An awareness of these genre mechanics is written into the novel.\\n Sally’s ambition is “to write non-condescending, ragingly feminist screenplays for romantic comedies”. She tells Noah, “When one of these movies doesn’t work, it’s usually because it’s horribly written and/or because the script hasn’t done the work of convincing you the couple is attracted to each other, so then you don’t care if obstacles get in their way and keep them apart.”\\n Sittenfeld creates a convincing connection between Sally and Noah: they describe their creative work – her comedy and his music – as the loves of their lives. So it makes sense that work is how their true selves are revealed and connect.\\n The conflict between our public and private selves has been central to Sittenfeld’s work since her debut, Prep, whose hyperaware, awkward teen protagonist embodied it. Sally suspects much of her writing emerges from that tension. And she tells Noah, “Sometimes I feel like I’m writing dialogue for the character of myself. I’m impersonating a normal human being when really I’m a confused freak.”\\n This aspect of Sally feels palpably real and suits a comedy writer: humour as armour; a protective layer to shield the real, vulnerable self. And theories such as the Danny Horst Rule feel like believable ways of protecting against romantic rejection.\\n Sally hasn’t allowed herself to have real relationships since a fellow TNO writer denied a mutual attraction she’d imagined, years ago. (Another Sittenfeld theme: young Hillary misreads male friendships in Rodham, and a similar situation plays out in the title story of Sittenfeld’s collection, You Think It, I’ll Say It.) “You’ve confused the romance of comedy with the comedy of romance,” Sally’s colleague told her.\\n It’s a good line. But there aren’t enough of them in Romantic Comedy. Sittenfeld can be a master of sardonic, devastatingly arch observational wit. She employed it beautifully in Eligible; perhaps it helped to borrow the skeleton of the most popular romantic comedy of all time.\\n Comedy is subjective, of course, but I didn’t find the jokes in this novel very funny. A skit about dogs doing Google searches fell flat. I groaned at many behind-the-scenes barbs among the comedy writers, such as Danny’s: “It’s very demeaning that you think my vagina needs cleaning. It shouldn’t smell floral when I’m getting oral.”\\n And while Romantic Comedy convinces readers of the connection between Sally and Noah, its characters and world often lack the texture of real life. Noah, repeatedly referred to as “cheesily handsome”, often reads more like a cipher than a real person. He once greets Sally with, “Those are great fancy shoes.” Danny and Annabel’s relationship is cliched even when it tries to draw us in: Danny loves to gaze into Annabel’s eyes on her bed with a million pillows “like in the fanciest hotel”. And Sittenfeld often uses bland descriptions that show us nothing. In the TNO boss’ office, people sit on “the surprisingly crappy furniture in the surprisingly unfancy space”.\\n The pace crawls in the section set at TNO, which takes up nearly half the book. Sittenfeld comprehensively researched Saturday Night Live; unfortunately, the text is weighed down with mechanical detail about the running of the show. The prose comparatively springs in its absence after the action moves location halfway through.\\n Further drafts may have moved this novel past the stage of being bogged in research. They might have sharpened the details and honed the comedy. But as it stands, Romantic Comedy feels like a promising sketch for a better novel.\\n Romantic Comedy by Curtis Sittenfeld is published by Doubleday, $32.99.\\n Jo Case is deputy books and ideas editor for The Conversation.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'headline': 'The ‘anonymous mogul’ who’s behind your favourite TV comedies',\n",
       "  'description': 'Bill Lawrence has a gift for TV comedy and his special skill is ensembles. And while you might not be familiar with his name, it’s likely that you’ve seen, and perhaps even loved and admired, some of his work. It’s most recently on display in Shrinking and Ted Lasso (both Apple TV+), but stretches back to Spin City (Stan*) and Scrubs (Disney+).\\n Dubbed “Television’s Anonymous Mogul” in a Los Angeles Times profile, Lawrence has been working steadily for decades. Although in his early days he was sacked from the writing team on Friends – “I was a kid. I misbehaved a bit,” he subsequently explained – he soon rebounded. Teaming up with Gary David Goldberg (Family Ties), he created Spin City (1996-2002), the first of his beautifully balanced ensemble comedies.\\n In a long career, he’s had some misfires (remember Whiskey Cavalier, Undateable, Surviving Jack or Life Sentence? No? Not surprising). But the good ones are memorable and display a capacity to create vibrant communities in an array of settings: the New York mayor’s office in Spin City; a Sacramento hospital in Scrubs (2001-10); a fictional Florida district in Cougar Town (2009-15); an English soccer club in Ted Lasso; a Pasadena psychology practice in Shrinking.\\n Sometimes, his series feature workplace families with artfully jumbled bags of diverse personalities; sometimes they’re biologically connected families, along with their friends, neighbours and work colleagues. In classic sitcom style, each character contributes a distinctive note to the whole: a dumb one, a daffy one, a pompous one, a smart and sassy one, a neurotic, etc.\\n Wherever they live and whatever they do, in the best of Lawrence’s work these ensembles present vibrant, idiosyncratic and very funny characters in productions distinguished by clever casting and pitch-perfect tones. As neatly illustrated by Shrinking and Ted Lasso, they can bounce confidently from laugh-out-loud physical gags and goofy humour to more tender moments where the multi-dimensional characters reveal their vulnerabilities.\\n Lawrence isn’t a one-man band: often his comedies are created and produced with others. Ted Lasso was developed with Jason Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt and Joe Kelly, and there’s a phalanx of producers, including Brett Goldstein, who plays Roy Kent. But there’s a discernible thread running through Lawrence’s productions, no matter who he’s working with, and that’s the strength of the communities that he constructs.\\n One indicator of how well they’re structured is how many of the supporting characters become scene-stealers, even when the shows are ostensibly built around a prominent lead, such as Michael J. Fox in Spin City, Sudeikis in Ted Lasso or Jason Segel in Shrinking. That’s because the writing is so strong and the casting is spot on. The focus of Spin City might be Fox’s deputy mayor, but as well as giving us the wonderful Connie Britton in a feisty early role, there’s the joy of Richard Kind’s sweet, bumbling, perpetually flustered press secretary. Scrubs follows the misadventures of Zach Braff as the caring, adorably discombobulated Dr John “J.D.” Dorian. But Sarah Chalke’s contribution as the delightfully ditzy Dr Elliot Reid would be right at home in a classic 1930s Hollywood screwball comedy (which is high praise).\\n My litmus test of a great ensemble is that it’s hard to pick a favourite character. In Ted Lasso, for example, there’s robust competition for that distinction: is it the magnificently monosyllabic Roy Kent? Indomitable, effervescent Keeley (Juno Temple)? Sweet Nigerian winger Sam Obisanya (Toheeb Jimoh)? Perhaps Dani Rojas (Christo Fernandez) with his sunny smile and gleeful pronouncement that “Football is life!” Titular Ted might be the main man, but, while taking nothing away from the nominal protagonist, the wealth of talent around him makes the series stronger.\\n That’s also true of Shrinking, where co-creator and co-producer Segel plays Jimmy, a psychologist and widower grieving the recent death of his wife (Lilan Bowden) and destructively spiralling. As it begins, he’s seeking comfort in drugs and casual sex, and failing to be the parent that his wounded teenage daughter, Alice (Lukita Maxwell), desperately needs.\\n Jimmy works in a practice with a trio of therapists and each of them is as much in need of supportive counselling as their patients. Gaby (Jessica Williams) is dealing with divorce and blithely maintaining she’s fine, when clearly she isn’t. Paul (Harrison Ford) is trying to manage a health issue and is troubled by a strained relationship with his adult daughter (Lily Rabe).\\n Beyond the core characters is a skilfully fleshed-out community, among them Jimmy’s nosy neighbour, Liz (Christa Miller, Lawrence’s wife, who also appeared in Scrubs and Cougar Town), his best friend, hilariously fast-talking gay lawyer Brian (Michael Urie), and his patient, war veteran Sean (Luke Tennie), who’s suffering from PTSD and dealing with anger-management issues. Notably, too, Ford is in his element as the grumpy elder of the practice, a terse type who protectively guards his personal space only to find it continually invaded by his colleagues.\\n As with Ted Lasso – whose fourth season has been the subject of fervid speculation – Shrinking was originally pitched with a three-season structure, with the first to focus on grief, the second on forgiveness and the final one on moving forward.\\n The first season has set the bar high, with a line introduced in the first episode and repeated in the final one to significantly different effect neatly illustrating the quality of the writing. Initially, Jimmy looks lovingly at Alice and tells her how much she reminds him of her mother, an observation that’s filled with pain. In the final episode, when the line is repeated, there’s only love and pride. Without labouring the point, the series illustrates how far the pair has come.\\n It’s classic Lawrence. So remember the name, because when you see it on a comedy, it’s likely to be worth watching.\\n * Stan is owned by Nine, the owner of this masthead.\\n Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.

       "  'description': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nPet\\nCatherine Chidgey, Europa, $32.99\\n Writing the young is hard, and worst when they are in an abusive situation. Catherine Chidgey’s novel tells of innocence becoming experience, gradually, and her form is the psychothriller. Justine is 12, and has a crush on her charismatic teacher, Mrs Price. What anchors the book is the precise details of a New Zealand childhood from late last century, the games, lessons and lolly cigarettes. Sinister is a constant undertone, from petty thefts and casual racism to the school’s Catholic doctrines. Mrs Price has more than her class in thrall, for Justine’s widowed father has also fallen in love with her. The tension rises, page by page, with abortion clinic picketing and finally murder. Chidgey maintains momentum, her narrative hooking the reader’s attention. It should make one hell of a movie.\\n Strangers at the Port\\nLauren Aimee Curtis, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, $29.99\\n Sydney-born Lauren Aimee Curtis has already been named as a Best Young British novelist in Granta this year, so this second novel comes with expectations. It consists of three parts: the narrations of Giulia and Giovanna, two peasant sisters born on an island off Sicily, and that of a tourist, an Austrian Archduke. In the late 19th century the island follows immemorial rhythms, but change arrives. First come convicts, then the devastating phylloxera virus. It will force emigration, ending in Australia as an academic seeks the elderly Giovanna’s first-hand testimony. The parallels between modern eco-disaster and dislocation are clear, if not belaboured. The difficulty is that the pacing is languid, the lissom prose somehow lacking the urgency of what it describes. And quick Googling establishes that Archduke Ludwig Salvador, a “loose” model for Curtis, was rather more interesting than his fictionalisation, being a travel writer and early ecologist.\\n The Invisible Hour\\nAlice Hoffman, Scribner, $32.99\\n American writer Alice Hoffman has a long and successful career of bending genres. This novel uses the trope of travel into the past, not as young adult fare, but as high literary fandom. Teenage Mia has been reared in a patriarchal cult, where what is verboten for women includes libraries. Of course she disobeys, and discovers Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter. She sees the parallels with her life; it radicalises her. That is one half of The Invisible Hour, the other being struggling writer Hawthorne himself. That Mia should enter the past, his present, is dandy; less is their affair, which pushes the book into historical romance territory. Hawthorne was a Victorian male, who memorably complained of “damned scribbling women”, authors of trash that prevented his literary success. Despite the evocative writing, the two halves of the book work against each other.\\n The List\\nYomi Adegoke, Fourth Estate, $32.99\\n It’s rare that a modern novel is bang up-to-date. The List comes with maximum hype and a television series in production. Its angle? How cancel culture affects a relationship. Michael and Ola are a young power couple in London, scaling the internet to success. What is different is that both are African. The novel begins with them engaged, out on the town drunk and happy. Next comes crisis, when Michael is named on an e-list of abusive males. At stake is their planned wedding, an extravaganza costing thousands of pounds, and also their love. The book adroitly details consumer and pop culture, gender and racial identity. Nothing is simple, least of all self-examination and remaking a life. Yet despite the book’s craft, the vitality of Bernardine Evaristo or Nnedi Okorafor seems missing: it becomes a bit of a slog.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nBetter Than Happiness\\nGregory P. Smith, Penguin, $35\\n After 10 years living alone in a rainforest in northern NSW, Gregory Smith was sitting on a park bench longing for a friend when he experienced a “full-blown vision”. Suddenly, he was in the middle of a smouldering battlefield surrounded by the ruins of his life. Sword in hand he stood ready for attack – only to realise that he was the enemy. He had been fighting himself for too long. In that moment of grace, he swore off the alcohol, drugs and cigarettes he’d used to dull the pain of his traumatic childhood. It was the beginning of a remarkable journey of transformation and acceptance that lead him from homelessness to a fulfilling job as an academic, from emotional isolation to unconditional love. The epiphanies that allowed him to turn his life around make this wise and self-searching memoir an invaluable handbook for those looking for a path out of their own dark forest.\\n Close to the Subject\\nDaniel Browning, Magabala Books, $34.99\\n “I am a storyteller – nothing more,” says Daniel Browning. He might well have said “nothing less”, as the pieces in this collection from his three decades of work as a Bundjalung and Kullilli journalist, radio broadcaster and writer reveal storytelling to be the most expansive, all-embracing of forms. This understanding of storytelling coheres around the presence of the storyteller as interpreter, medium, editor, critic, commentator and showcaser of Indigenous voices, whether he is talking to Doris Pilkington, author of Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, teasing out the tale behind the plaster cast found in Lyon of an Aboriginal man from Fraser Island, reflecting on Warwick Thornton’s documentary about the uses and abuses of the Southern Cross or offering his own forceful critique of nationhood. “Australia is a shadow ... It plays out like an in-joke; no one is quite sure when to laugh.”\\n A Clear Flowing Yarra\\nHarry Saddler, Affirm Press, $29.99\\n So accustomed have Melburnians become to disparaging the Yarra that a joyful book about this waterway would have seemed, not long ago, to be a contradiction in terms. Then came the COVID lockdowns and we started to see the river and its tributaries in a different light. Harry Saddler takes this new appreciation to even greater heights in a book that exudes an infectious and giddy delight for its subject. There are encounters with platypuses from the riverbank in a suburban park. There are evenings spent listening to and eyeballing powerful owls. There are sightings of Salvatore, the adventurous seal. As he immerses himself in the river and its environs, he also gets to know the human creatures – from the Yarra River keeper to the community groups – who share his love of it, swim in it and care for it. If you thought you knew the Yarra, Saddler will make you think again.\\n Love, Dad\\nLaurie Steed, Fremantle Press, $32.99\\n Of the trials that heroes undergo in classical mythology, becoming a dad tends not to be one of them – which says a lot about traditional notions of masculinity. Laurie Steed believed he’d fashioned a workable “warrior-self” along the lines of the “tough, silent kind of manliness [that] was sold to us as boys”. Until fatherhood exposed his fault lines. As he stares into the eyes of his newborn son, he is struck by the fact that although he’s now a dad, he has not yet worked out how to be a man. Love, Dad is an open letter of gratitude to his sons for initiating him into a richer, more emotionally attuned version of manhood that fits his particular circumstances and deepens his relationship with his own father. This more nuanced self is not afraid to acknowledge his struggles, shortcomings and anxieties as a dad and a writer, while lovingly celebrating the wild ride of parenthood.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'The image presents a split composition, juxtaposing a headshot of a woman on the left with the cover of a book on the right.\\n\\n**Left Side (Headshot):**\\n\\nThe woman in the headshot appears to be middle-aged, with shoulder-length dark brown hair parted slightly off-center. Her expression is neutral, almost pensive, with her lips closed in a relaxed position. Her gaze is direct, looking straight at the camera. Her skin tone is light, with a natural complexion. She wears a dark v-neck shirt underneath a light gray, textured blazer or cardigan. The background consists of horizontal, dark-colored slats, likely part of a wall or other architectural feature. The lighting is even and soft, suggesting a professional or semi-professional setting for the photograph.\\n\\n**Right Side (Book Cover):**\\n\\nThe book cover features a vintage aesthetic, reminiscent of 1960s or 1970s fashion photography. A woman with long, light brown hair is seated in the driver\\'s seat of a convertible car. She wears large, round, white earrings and a flowing, sleeveless, mustard-yellow top or dress. Her profile is visible as she looks away from the camera, towards the road ahead.  She holds the steering wheel with one hand and rests the other on the car\\'s gear shift. The car itself is a light color, possibly white or cream, and the background suggests a cityscape or urban setting. The book title, \"ROMANTIC COMEDY,\" is displayed vertically along the left edge of the cover in bold, uppercase letters. The author\\'s name, \"CURTIS SITTENFELD,\" appears in a larger, bolder font at the bottom of the cover, also in uppercase.  Two blurbs, seemingly positive reviews or endorsements, are placed on the cover. One, attributed to Kate Atkinson, reads, \"One of my favourite writers\\'.\" The other, from Elizabeth Day, states, \"I am obsessed with this book. Warm, wise, extremely funny.\"  A smaller line of text at the bottom identifies the book as a \"Sunday Times and New York Times bestseller.\"\\n\\n**Relationship between the two halves:**\\n\\nThe juxtaposition strongly suggests that the woman in the headshot is Curtis Sittenfeld, the author of the book \"Romantic Comedy\" displayed on the right. The image likely serves as promotional material, combining a portrait of the author with the visually appealing book cover.\\n\\n**Detailed Description and Analysis:**\\n\\n**Headshot (Left):**\\n\\n* **Framing and Composition:** The headshot is tightly cropped, focusing on the woman\\'s face and upper torso.  The horizontal lines of the background provide a contrasting visual element to the subject\\'s vertical posture.\\n* **Lighting and Color:** The lighting is soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows and creating a natural look. The color palette is muted, with the gray blazer and dark shirt complementing the subject\\'s hair and skin tone.\\n* **Expression and Pose:** The woman\\'s expression is neutral and approachable, conveying a sense of confidence and professionalism. Her direct gaze engages the viewer, while her relaxed posture suggests a sense of ease and comfort.\\n\\n**Book Cover (Right):**\\n\\n* **Visual Style and Era:** The cover\\'s vintage aesthetic, characterized by the car, the woman\\'s clothing and hairstyle, and the color palette, evokes a sense of nostalgia and classic Hollywood glamour. This style likely aims to attract readers interested in romantic stories with a retro feel.\\n* **Typography and Layout:** The vertical placement of the title \"ROMANTIC COMEDY\" is unconventional yet eye-catching. The bold, uppercase font emphasizes the genre and creates a strong visual impact. The author\\'s name, prominently displayed at the bottom, reinforces brand recognition.\\n* **Imagery and Symbolism:** The image of the woman driving a convertible suggests independence, freedom, and a sense of adventure. The yellow top or dress adds a touch of vibrancy and optimism, while the urban setting hints at a sophisticated and contemporary backdrop for the story.\\n* **Blurbs and Endorsements:** The inclusion of positive blurbs from established authors like Kate Atkinson and Elizabeth Day adds credibility and social proof, encouraging potential readers to pick up the book.  The use of phrases like \"favourite writers\\',\" \"obsessed,\" \"warm,\" \"wise,\" and \"funny\" provides concise yet compelling insights into the book\\'s tone and content.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe combined image effectively promotes Curtis Sittenfeld\\'s book \"Romantic Comedy.\" The professional headshot presents the author in a relatable and approachable manner, while the eye-catching book cover conveys the genre and tone of the story. The vintage aesthetic and positive endorsements further enhance the book\\'s appeal, targeting readers seeking a lighthearted, romantic escape with a touch of classic Hollywood charm. The image is well-suited for use in online advertising, social media promotion, and other marketing materials.\\n\\n**Further Speculation and Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe title \"Romantic Comedy\" and the vintage aesthetic of the cover suggest a story that explores themes of love, relationships, and humor within a retro setting. The choice of a female protagonist driving a convertible might symbolize empowerment and a break from traditional gender roles. The endorsements hint at a well-written and engaging narrative that resonates with readers on an emotional level.\\n\\n**Target Audience:**\\n\\nThe image likely targets readers interested in romantic comedies, particularly those who appreciate a vintage aesthetic and witty writing. The endorsements from established female authors suggest a potential appeal to a predominantly female readership.\\n\\n**Marketing Strategy:**\\n\\nThe image\\'s clean design and clear messaging make it effective for various marketing channels. The combination of author portrait and book cover provides a comprehensive introduction to both the author and her work. The inclusion of endorsements and bestseller status adds credibility and encourages purchase consideration.\\n'},\n",

       "  'description': 'Six of the best diversions, including what to watch, read, eat and buy.\\n SPOTLIGHT / Star Witness Gwyneth Paltrow’s Trial Is Her Best Role in Years declared a recent headline in The New Yorker – and it’s not wrong. The Academy Award winner was the subject of a civil suit in a Utah court regarding a so-called ski-and-run accident in 2016. The actress was accused of running into a fellow skier while holidaying with her family. She said au contraire – he ran into her.\\n The court found in Paltrow’s favour (#Gwynnocent) but no one really cared about the nuts and bolts of the case. Instead, the world binged it like a Netflix drama, tuning in to check out Paltrow’s daily court looks (she’s wearing a turtleneck!) and quoting her most iconic one-liners, including the new meme: “Well, I lost half a day of skiing.”\\n It’s the latest in a long line of celebrity court battles to have captured the public fascination, stretching back to 1995 and OJ Simpson’s “trial of the century”. Last year delivered Johnny Depp v Amber Heard, which spawned a parallel trial on TikTok in which social media users declared Depp the innocent party and Heard guilty of, well, everything. A timely reminder, perhaps, that treating the courtroom as soap opera can have troubling real-world consequences. One worth remembering, given the next celebrity to take the stand will be one Donald Trump – a man who knows the power of performance better than anyone. Thomas Mitchell\\n SHOP / Swap shop Flaunting a fin-shaped design and made from repurposed coffee husks, the HuskeeCup is a stylish reminder to choose to reuse. Drinkers buy a cup, which come in a range of sizes, from a participating cafe (8oz cup in charcoal or natural, $20) when ordering their caffeine fix, then return it when placing their next order (no need to even wash it). The “deposited” cups are sanitised and put back in rotation, with customers leaving with their fave brew in a “new” one. In due course, all cups, lids and saucers can be returned to Huskee or its swap partners – an app shows their locations – for end-of-life recycling. Frances Mocnik\\n EAT / Golden brown Spice up your weekend with a teaspoon of Golden Vadouvan, a sweet, smoky spice blend of roasted onions and garlic with turmeric, mustard seed, bittersweet fenugreek and more (150g, $22.50). It’s Indian but also French, said to have been created by the French colonists of Pondicherry (now Puducherry) on India’s south-eastern coast, and it will take your salmon kedgeree to the next level. Beat it into butter to pan-fry fish and melt over carrots, or just sprinkle over your weekend eggs for an instant wow factor. Jill Dupleix\\n READ / Role reversal Ever wondered why good-looking, talented women often date average-looking but interesting guys, while the reverse rarely happens? In Romantic Comedy by American novelist Curtis Sittenfeld, Sally is a divorced 30-something writer for a hit TV comedy show. Fed up with seeing gorgeous female celebrities hook up with the show’s dorky male writers, she writes a sketch about it. Enter Noah, a handsome rock star and guest on the show. The sexual tension escalates as they banter their way through lockdown via email. Among the book’s pithy one-liners: “Hot eventually gets boring but funny never does.” Sittenfeld has form in analysing relationships: she’s the author of bestselling 2020 novel Rodham, which reimagined the life Hillary Rodham would have had if she’d not married Bill Clinton. Nicole Abadee\\n WEAR / Step right up How many pairs of shoes does a man need? Four, according to the founders of shoe company Etymology – Gabriel Abi-Saab and brothers William and Albert Phung. A loafer or two, an Oxford and something not black. The Sydney-based trio founded the company during the pandemic and this month released their four-pair debut collection, which leans heavily into the loafer. The all-leather shoes are handcrafted in family-run workshops in the Spanish shoe-making capital of Almansa, and retail here online for $425 a pair. The inspiration? Abi-Saab’s Lebanese-Australian heritage: “My dad always wore this pair of loafers he found in Lebanon, even when going to the greengrocers. He took pride in the way he dressed.” Taking following in dad’s footsteps to a whole new level. Melissa Singer\\n WATCH / Dead Ringers It’s always a concern when a TV series or film casts an actor to star opposite themselves; the double-up can be great but can also be a gimmick used to paper over a thin plot. It worked a treat for Eddie Murphy in Coming To America but not in The Nutty Professor, while John Malkovich proved there is no such thing as too much Malkovich in Being John Malkovich. Thankfully, British actress Rachel Weisz is so charming in Dead Ringers (Amazon Prime) that you never get sick of seeing her star alongside herself. In this modern take on David Cronenberg’s 1988 thriller, Weisz plays twin gynaecologists whose desperation to change how women give birth pushes them into ethically questionable territory.

       "  'headline': 'Yes, the men of Sex and the City were awful, but things are improving',\n",
       "  'description': 'The interaction of the past with the present is the faultline on which great stories are built, sure. But many Sex and the City superfans were dismayed to learn, via the trailer for the second series of SATC’s sequel And Just Like That, that the show will recycle Carrie’s old boyfriend Aidan into her life.\\n Aidan Shaw was one of the two most important of Carrie’s love interests during the long-running show, the beta male in the love triangle he (unwittingly) participated in with Carrie and the horrendous Big.\\n Big was the alpha whose emotional avoidance was dressed up as mystery, a man so emotionally unavailable that Carrie never even felt entitled to use his real name (which turned out to be John – apt because Big/John was revealed to be decidedly average once Carrie finally captured him and they settled down).\\n Aidan was folksy and handsome, a carpenter who worked with his hands and wore lumberjack shirts without any apparent sense of irony. He loved his dog. He loved Carrie. He made a chair that she bought for her apartment. What could be so bad about that?\\n As many SATC scholars have elucidated since, Aidan didn’t really love Carrie just as she was. He hated her smoking. He hated her going out. He hated her attachment to her glamorous lifestyle. Had he even met Carrie? That’s all she was – a smoker with a glamorous lifestyle who enjoyed going out a lot.\\n Aidan hauled Carrie, the Manhattan denizen fuelled by Cosmopolitans and the New York Times Style section, into the woods to hang out at his bug-infested cabin. He trapped her into commitment by buying the apartment next door and knocking down the wall between them. She felt invaded. Was it any wonder she resumed the ciggies in secret and started an affair with the now-married Big?\\n Yes, Carrie was awful: neurotic, flighty, self-absorbed and terrible with money. But she was not as bad as the men she dated.\\n To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the iconic show – which was probably the biggest single cultural influence on women of a generation – Vanity Fair published an article titled “Who was the worst man on Sex and the City?”\\n It’s a close-fought contest. My vote would go to the horrid Jack Berger, a brooding wannabe literary novelist who went into a prolonged sulk when Carrie’s (non-literary and therefore inferior, in his eyes) book was published to great success.\\n Many of Carrie’s romantic trials involved men who were attracted to her success and independence but were threatened by it. Big at least let Carrie be Carrie. But even the bad men of Sex and the City all had something superficially attractive about them.\\n The annals of romantic comedy are full of unkempt and even oafish men who score hot babes – think the 2007 Judd Apatow film Knocked Up, in which a stoner slacker (played by Seth Rogen) wins over the successful and attractive Alison, after impregnating her during a one-night stand. Or Notting Hill, where the hopeless Hugh Grant character snags a movie star.\\n Woody Allen’s entire oeuvre (which has become tricky anyway, for other well-documented reasons I won’t delve into here) depends upon the premise that a beautiful, clever woman will be irresistibly drawn to a nebbish, prickly man who is deeply selfish, just because he cracks a few self-deprecating jokes and knows a lot about classic cinema.\\n Many sitcoms rely on the trope of a grumpy and/or hopeless husband who is adored by his efficient and attractive wife (my favourite episode of The Simpsons is where Marge snaps because she doesn’t get enough help around the house; she is sent away for a break to a spa called Rancho Relaxo. But Homer is so incompetent he loses baby Maggie while his wife is away and has to call a Missing Baby Hotline to locate her).\\n It has been a quarter-century since Sex and the City first aired, and it busted genres while creating its own. It has heavily influenced its successors – everything from the Millennial homage of Girls, to shows like Derry Girls, the delightful Irish comedy series about a group of teenagers, whose antics are set against the backdrop of Northern Ireland during the Troubles in the mid-1990s.\\n In the ensuing decades, the ideal male romantic lead has evolved somewhat. The recent bestselling book by cult American author Curtis Sittenfeld, Romantic Comedy, up-ends the trope of the “schlubby” male hero who lands the hot, eligible chick just by making her laugh.\\n The book asks why the opposite case is not often portrayed - why do we never see a frumpy-but-funny woman capturing the attention of a handsome, highly successful hero? (Although it must be said, Bridget Jones was a bit this person.)\\n It then goes on to explore that very scenario, with a male love interest who is hot, talented and famous, but also slightly insecure (he wears a wig). Our hero openly admits he is no match for the clever wit of our heroine, who has sub-Hollywood looks and is skittish around commitment.\\n The world’s most-read contemporary author, Colleen Hoover, who has barnstormed traditional publishing with her popular fiction, upturned the ideal of the male hero in her most famous book, It Ends With Us. The hero is introduced as dark, mercurial and emotionally elusive, but when the heroine finally lands him, she finds out the truth – he is prone to volcanic rages, and he hurts her when he’s in the grips of them.\\n In this story, the archetypal hero is a trap, and the heroine’s real struggle is to free herself. The heroines of 2023 crave freedom, and men who will give it to them. But romance still has a momentum of its own – Hoover wrote the sequel, It Starts With Us, because her fans wanted her to, and they specifically told her they wanted their heroine to fall in love again and stay there, this time.\\n Reader: she gave them what they wanted.\\n Jacqueline Maley is a columnist.\\n The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own.

       "  'description': 'HOLLYWOOD\\nBurn It Down: Power, Complicity and a Call for Change in Hollywood \\nMaureen Ryan\\nHarperCollins, $60\\n Maureen Ryan is as mad as hell about what’s been happening in Hollywood. And the Vanity Fair contributing editor has written Burn It Down to tell readers why. “What should be assessed is not just the creative product, its financial cost, and its efficiency (or lack thereof),” she writes, “It’s also how productive and nurturing an environment it is.” Something that she goes to great lengths to explain isn’t happening now and never has been.\\n Her book, which deals mainly but not exclusively with the world of television, was written before the recent strikes by the American Writers and Screen Actors Guilds and doesn’t deal directly with the specific issues that have provoked them. But it does point to a range of resentments that have been simmering away for years, to do with how workplaces that ought to service the needs of employees have frequently become hellholes.\\n To most readers, much of this won’t come as a surprise. Hollywood has long been infamous for what was once seen as routine behaviour but is now regarded as disreputable. The public testimonies of the courageous survivors of sexual assaults by men in powerful positions have exposed some of the darker activities hidden behind the surface gloss of the American film business.\\n Ryan mentions in passing that she herself suffered this fate at the hands of an unnamed TV executive. She wrote at some length about it in Variety in October 2017, and her smouldering anger about what happened permeates the book.\\n Drawing on the experiences of a young actress, she even goes so far as to liken what goes on in Hollywood to the way cults conduct themselves. “How is a cult that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day all that different from a set (or a workplace) that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day?“\\n Her overall approach is messy, featuring long-winded attempts to explode myths about the Hollywood business, most of which were blasted to smithereens long ago. But she also provides compelling, detailed accounts of the failures and moral breakdowns that have occurred behind the scenes on the long-running series, Lost (2004–2010) and Sleepy Hollow (2013–2017), and that (contrary to the view that emerges, fictionalised, in Curtis Sittenfeld’s irresistible novel, Romantic Comedy) allegedly continue at NBC’s Saturday Night Live, the late-night sketch comedy show that has been around for almost half a century, and elsewhere.\\n Some of her sources allow her to use their names; others choose to remain anonymous whistleblowers, fearful of the consequences for their careers if they become known as troublemakers. She manages to get a few of those accused – “the sinister forces in the shadows” – to go on the record with their responses, but most ignored her requests for interview.\\n Stories abound of nightmare situations arising in writers’ rooms, on sets and in private offices, around racism, sexism, homophobia, inequitable returns for efforts, and the systemic abuse of those without power. Ryan’s crusader-like passion sometimes leads to overkill, the litany of sins that she uncovers providing more examples than required to make her points when a more selective approach would have been more effective.\\n But it does mean that many of those that the system has turned into victims do get an opportunity to have their voices heard, even if only as “Joyce” or “Hannah”, or any of the other names she attaches to those who wish to avoid reprisal.\\n Ryan is especially illuminating in her examination of some of the disturbing developments at Saturday Night Live. In this context, she cites journalist Seth Simons’ astute but unfashionable notion that stand-up comedians have long occupied a space for an ugly culture, one “where it has been OK to be a horrible person” (a point that becomes especially pertinent in the light of the coverage of Russell Brand’s transgressions).\\n In the final section of the book, acknowledging that there’s no magic fix for the problems she’s identified, Ryan proposes several ways in which it might be possible to repair “the damage created by allowing toxic people – and systems – to run amok”.\\n She quotes The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer about the best way to go about it: “The hope for a more equitable, democratic and prosperous society does not lie with enlightened corporations but with organised workers.” And, in line with this, she points to the need for writers, actors and others to work together to establish grassroots alliances and respectful workplaces in which to do their creative work.\\n She ends by explaining that she’s no revolutionary, that she doesn’t actually want to burn Hollywood down. What she really wants is a business equivalent of a “prescribed burn”, one that can help prevent a wildfire. “Fire can be rejuvenating,” she writes, creating a neat analogy courtesy of National Geographic. “It returns nutrients to the soil … and can help young trees and other plants start to grow.”\\n Burn It Down sometimes labours its points, but the urgency with which Ryan champions her cause is both affecting and effective.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'Australia’s top chief executives almost unanimously expect the domestic economy to skirt a recession next year despite lingering inflation, pressure on household budgets and the prospect of a long monetary pause.\\n CEOs from the banking, mining, retail, property and industrials sectors expect Australia’s economy to slow in the coming year, which along with cost pressures could mean a tougher 2024 for business and pressure on planned investment.\\n “We’re likely to avoid a hard landing in 2024,” Goodman Group founder and CEO Greg Goodman said.\\n “It’s also likely that inflation will keep slowing as a result of the interest rate rises we’ve seen. The business climate is, however, going to be more difficult, with spending more subdued.”\\n Macquarie Group’s Shemara Wikramanayake said Australia’s immigration profile and strength in key industries should keep the country out of recession in 2024; however, slower economic growth should bring inflation back to the Reserve Bank’s targeted range by the end of the year.\\n “Broad-based inflationary pressures, driven by relatively strong economic demand and a tight labour market, will likely abate in the face of this slower growth,” Ms Wikramanayake said.\\n Commonwealth Bank boss Matt Comyn said there was only low risk of a recession next year, although that would increase should high inflation persist and the RBA needed to increase official interest rates further.\\n “Given the sharp rise in interest rates over the past 18 months, we think we are at, or very close to, the top of the current rate cycle,” Mr Comyn said.\\n The comments were made as part of The Australian Financial Review’s annual Chanticleer survey of more than 50 top ASX CEOs. Nearly all said higher interest rates and inflation were likely to slow growth; however, they pointed to immigration and infrastructure spending as reasons why Australia would avoid a recession.\\n Wesfarmers CEO Rob Scott said the homegrown cost pressures, including staff costs and raw materials, were the “greatest challenge to inflation” in the coming year.\\n “We are seeing significant increases in supply chain costs, wages, power and other services,” said Mr Scott, whose company owns hardware retailer Bunnings Warehouse, discount retailer Kmart and a big industrials chemicals business.\\n “There are risks of further pressures in 2024 with additional regulation and compliance costs, and less flexibility in the workplace to adjust to dynamic changes in the market will ultimately increase costs if we are not careful.”\\n CEOs with consumer-facing businesses said cost-of-living pressures would keep customers rethinking their spending habits and choices. Even so, they kept referring to the economy as “resilient”.\\n “I think most people have been surprised at how resilient the economy has been this year in spite of global shocks and interest rate hikes, so we’re cautiously optimistic that resilience continues,” said Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson, who took over from Alan Joyce in September.\\n “What we’re seeing is that demand across Jetstar and Qantas remains above pre-COVID levels, despite cost-of-living pressures.”\\n Coles CEO Leah Weckert, also new to her role, agreed customers were feeling the fiscal pinch: “Overall, we are optimistic about the resilience of the Australian economy and, in particular, non-discretionary sectors like supermarkets,” she said.\\n Woolworths’ Brad Banducci was reluctant to make any economic predictions, but said the government’s revised approach to skilled migration had helped address labour shortages that should ease cost pressures in the economy.\\n “It will allow Australia to better attract the talent we need to fill critical skills gaps and labour shortages across the economy, in turn supporting productivity growth,” Mr Banducci said.\\n “The ‘Skills In Demand’ visa is a big step forward and will help bring experts with emerging skills and expertise into Australia to help train and develop local team members.”\\n Elliott Rusanow, who runs Westfield owner Scentre Group and is a major landlord to the likes of Coles and Woolworths, said consumers were still spending up big at the shops.\\n “When you look at the consumer, aggregate consumer spending is also high,” Mr Rusanow said. “We’re seeing this play out in our business partner sales which are at record levels.”\\n Seven Group’s Ryan Stokes was one of only a few outliers who said there was a “high risk” of a hard economic landing and there was little room for further interest rate tightening.\\n “The resilience shown to date can only withstand so many shocks inflicted by the RBA,” Mr Stokes said.\\n “The RBA’s approach to the cash rate will eventually trigger the economic contraction they are targeting ... In short, rates have already moved too far too quickly. Patience needs to be demonstrated. Further rate increases are not required in the near term.”\\n Newmont CEO Tom Palmer, an Australian whose company bought Australia’s biggest listed goldminer Newcrest Mining this year, said it was too early to declare victory in the fight against inflation.\\n “Until there is a sustained and honest effort to increase productivity in Australia through genuine reform, the RBA has little option but to use the blunt instrument of cash rate increases to try and reduce inflation,” Mr Palmer said.\\n With Ciara Seccombe and Edmund Tadros\\n'},\n",

       "  'description': 'FICTION\\nEdenglassie\\nMelissa Lucashenko\\nUniversity of Queensland Press, $32.99\\n When I was at high school in northern NSW, in a town just south of the Queensland border, one of my teachers reflected on the remarkable fact that Australia was founded as a modern country without major bloodshed. Melissa Lucashenko’s electrifying new novel draws on recent research suggesting that “There were more dead on the Queensland frontier than Aussies killed in World War One”, making notions of Australia’s’ “peaceful” history now seem almost wilfully blind.\\n Lucashenko’s title is a portmanteau of Edinburgh and Glasgow, and was the name given to the penal colony that became Brisbane. Edenglassie opens in 2024, whenan ageing Aboriginal woman, Eddie, takes a fall and lands herself in hospital. Sceptical of the medical profession, given the history of her mistreatment by authorities, Lucashenko tells us, “she had been concerned with dirt all her life, and with being dispossessed of the same, not to mention treated like dirt, which is to say, trampled over and disregarded as a general rule”.\\n While in hospital, she is attended-to by Doctor Johnny, who has recently learned via DNA testing of his Indigenous ancestry, but Eddie’s granddaughter, the plain-speaking Winona, is quick to scuttle any idea that he can identify as Indigenous, without a thorough cultural education. Winona is something of a firebrand for Indigenous rights; in one particularly amusing incident, Winona confiscates the didgeridoo of a busking white man and wields it as a weapon against him.\\n In a second narrative strand set in the mid-1800s, we learn about Mulanyin, who belongs “to the five Yugembeh rivers which fell like wide blue ribbons from the western range”. Travelling with his law-brother Murree, Mulanyin encounters Nita. Nita was “rescued” from slavery by the Petrie family, working as a maid, but ultimately taken on as the family’s ward (though she continues to provide their domestic labour.)\\n The love affair between Nita and Mulanyin, as well as the depiction of kinship, shows the intimate ties these characters have to the land, defining not only their culture but notions of selfhood. In one scene, Mulanyin attempts to fish a female mulloway, but is directed by his elders to return it to the sea. Mulanyin then has “the electric realisation that all his life he had been eating the decisions of his ancestors”.\\n Edenglassie shows etiquette and respect as central to the Indigenous way of life, belying prevailing colonial attitudes. Mulanyin observes that a young Yugambeh boy was “quite rude not to stop and yarn”.\\n In 2024, Eddie encounters a presence in her hospital room, masterfully named by Lucashenko as “the Voice”. The omniscient narrator in Edenglassie serves Lucashenko particularly well, hovering between characters, enacting with nuance a variety of Indigenous perspectives: the moderate Eddie, who is more ready to reconcile herself to a peaceful solution, and Winona, who is understandably angry on behalf of her people.\\n Eddie explains to Winona at one point that the Petries’ son Tom was actually initiated, and thus “part of the tribe”, explaining that “things could have been different alright. If the whitefellas had just asked.” Throughout Edenglassie, the hope offered by Lucashenko, who won the Miles Franklin award in 2019 for Too Much Lip, is that despite the various injustices meted out by white settlers, understanding across cultural boundaries remains nonetheless possible through communication and respect.\\n In the earlier time-stream, the oppression of Indigenous people is extreme: we learn about a curfew announced by the cracking of a “stockwhip”. In an unforgettable scene, Lucashenko enacts the execution of Dundalli, an Indigenous warrior and resistance fighter whose death was horribly botched. At one point we learn that “the Kurilpa and Magandjin had been rudely shoved back from their river, often at gunpoint”.\\n Even the well-meaning Dr Johnny unwittingly commits a number of faux pas. When he points out a plaque in Brisbane, acknowledging an Indigenous warrior named Mulrobin, Winona derides this as tokenistic given Indigenous people have had to fight for every minor gain, which for her and her family has been “exhausting”. Dr Johnny also doubts the presence of the Voice and considers it a manifestation of Eddie’s cognitive decline, but to Indigenous characters this ancestral presence is very real.\\n Given the historical research Lucashenko deploys here, it’s not surprising that Mulanyin’s story involves a shocking brutality, and the depiction of the events of Mulanyin’s life are only made more poignant by the story of his love for the land, particularly the “saltwater”, and his palpable connection to kin.\\n It is through the dual time streams that Lucashenko emphasises the importance of truth-telling to contemporary Indigenous Australians. Eddie needs the truth to be recounted and acknowledged so that these past injustices may be healed, and the lack of truth is hauntingly evoked by Lucashenko as a profound absence.\\n Lucashenko’s meticulously researched novel speaks to a deep-seated violence not just in the past, but in the way our colonial history continues to be represented. Edenglassie forms part of an essential conversation about our shared heritage; its urgent and modest request is that we listen.\\n Gretchen Shirm’s latest novel, The Crying Room, is published by Transit Lounge.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'Disney may be better known for its theme parks and blockbuster movies, but its streaming service successfully draws on a pair of historic America television networks, spin-offs from its fabled franchises, and a growing cohort of original commissions. Putting together the platform’s essential scripted shows required difficult choices, but the list is illustrious.\\n Abbott Elementary\\nThe great American sitcom is not dead, it’s just morphed into this delightfully witty mockumentary about the ever-burdened staff at a primary school in West Philadelphia. Creator and star Quinta Brunson delivers 22-minute episodes that sing with character humour and absurd machinations. Janella James, as the school’s questionable principal, is the best scene-stealer on television right now.\\n The Americans\\nWhat began as a sharp Cold War thriller, following a pair of Russian spies (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) living as a couple complete with children in Washington DC, became a masterful study of what we will and won’t reveal to those closest to us. Deception has rarely been so intensely intimate, culminating in a note-perfect finale after six seasons.\\n Andor\\nThe rough equation is Star Wars with less Jedi and more John le Carre, but that doesn’t do justice to Tony Gilroy’s brilliant prequel series about how the dedicated spy from 2016’s Rogue One movie (Diego Luna), found his calling as a revolutionary. Dispensing with nostalgia but staging gripping set-pieces, this is a galaxy far, far away reimagined for adults.\\n Arrested Development\\nIgnore the subsequent Netflix revival, the original three seasons of this wonderfully loopy comedy about a dysfunctional family’s downfall constitute one of the funniest shows of this century. Jason Bateman is the dutiful son trying to hold everything together, but he’s surrounded by self-sabotaging kin whose antics are perfectly shaped by dry digressions, meta-commentary, and brain-bending ramifications.\\n Atlanta\\nDonald Glover’s surrealist-tinged comedy about a struggling college graduate (Glover) who works as the manager of his rapper cousin (an immense Brian Tyree Henry) was one of the most ambitious shows television has witnessed, and mostly it succeeded. The implications of being Black in America spiralled into uncomfortable realities, otherworldly horror, and soulful self-recognition.\\n The Bear\\n”Yes, chef!” A blackly comic drama about a fine dining savant (Jeremy Allen White) returning to run his late brother’s Chicago sandwich joint, the two seasons to date of this series have been defined by corrosive tension, whiplash humour, and family dynamics that are painfully gripping. Watching creativity and renewal take hold for these characters is both a blessing and a curse.\\n Bob’s Burgers\\nIt took a season to get going but Loren Bouchard’s animated sitcom about the family behind a New Jersey burger joint has become one of television’s enduring pleasures. The Belcher clan are a wonderful mix of characters, driving a winning sense of humour that eschews pop-culture references for a depiction of the everyday that is charmingly plausible.\\n Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\nThe original slay queen, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Geller) is a Californian high school student chosen to battle the forces of evil. It’s the first of many inspired mash-ups in this deeply influential supernatural adventure, which shines as a tale of feminist empowerment, a goofy serial, and a homage to friendship powered by rat-a-tat dialogue.\\n Desperate Housewives\\nIs it a soap opera or a satire of a soap opera? Marc Cherry’s blockbuster comedy about the many intrigues surrounding a group of neighbouring married women was both and much more. Upending how network television depicted wives, life on Wisteria Lane was wild, insightful, and given to almighty twists.\\n Homeland\\nEpisodic television has rarely seen a performance as fierce and finely judged as the one Claire Danes delivers in this spy drama, playing an obsessive CIA agent with bipolar disorder. The early seasons, with Damian Lewis as a possible foe hiding in plain sight, are a sinewy two-hander, before Danes’ Carrie Mathison becomes the focus of a taut, globe-trotting study of betrayal and sacrifice.\\n How I Met Your Mother\\nIf you crave the reassuring familiarity of a multi-camera studio sitcom, the nine seasons of this Hollywood comedy about the loves and laughs of a group of (initially) twentysomethings will hit the spot. The punchlines are sharp but the casting is perfect: Jason Segel, Cobie Smulders, Alyson Hannigan, and a fearless Neil Patrick Harris shine.\\n Loki\\nThe one television spin-off of Marvel’s movie blockbusters that mattered follows the titular brother of Thor, Tom Hiddleston’s capricious, arrogant Loki, who finds himself caught up with the agency regulating time itself and its representative, Owen Wilson’s laconic investigator. The unlikely duo’s double act is the show’s selling point, a give and take that is verbally dexterous and emotionally primed.\\n Lost\\nThe network drama that didn’t so much kick the door in for grandiose ambitions as knock the entire house down, the 121 episodes of this science-fiction laced epic gave us smoke monsters, temporal shifts, labyrinthine conspiracies and a handful of finely revealed characters. The mysterious island they were trapped on was a puzzle box of vast possibility, somehow kept in motion through six seasons.\\n Mrs America\\nCate Blanchett, Rose Byrne, and Uzo Aduba headline an exemplary cast in this historical drama about the 1970s battle in America between second-wave feminists and the conservative women who opposed them. This is a vivid, telling recreation, with depictions of real-life figures that are anything but textbook – these public and private conflicts are both nuanced and prescient.\\n The Muppet Show\\nAs the oldest show on this list – it ran between 1976 and 1981 – there are certainly dips in Jim Henson’s ground-breaking reinvention of the variety show, but Kermit, Miss Piggy, and their iconic fellow hand puppets thoroughly transcend the era. The best guests gave the backstage absurdity an artful, idiosyncratic charge, with guests like Elton John, Gilda Radner, and John Cleese.\\n NYPD Blue\\nControversial when it debuted in 1993, Steven Bochco and David Milch’s police procedural about a fictional Manhattan precinct raised the bar for the cop drama with intertwining storylines, pungent dialogue, and reflections on trauma. David Caruso ducked out after one season, but the pairing of Jimmy Smits and Dennis Franz gave the show a memorable core that carried it to classic status.\\n One Mississippi\\nDebuting in 2015 and unfairly cancelled after just two seasons, comedian Tig Notaro’s semi-autobiographical series has her playing a breast cancer patient who returns to her hometown to care for her dying mother. The observational comedy that ensures is deeply personal, heartbreaking in its misunderstandings, and willing to suspend reality to grasp deeper truths. This hidden gem is ripe for rediscovery.\\n Only Murders in the Building\\nSteve Martin, Selena Gomez, and Martin Short are aces together in this farcical crime caper about a trio of true crime podcast addicts who start recording when a neighbour in their NYC apartment block is murdered. It’s a rapid-fire satire and deadpan comedy of manners, but its secret weapon is a melancholic undertow that makes the motives tragic and the investigators dedicated to their unlikely friendship.\\n The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\\nThe murder trial that transfixed America 30 years ago is re-examined in a limited series that reveals the distorting nature of fame, rampant ego, and sexist double standards. In an all-star cast none surpass Courtney B. Vance as defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran: a showman created by the very system he despises.\\n Pose\\nBoisterous with a bittersweet chaser, this drama recreates in stunning detail the ball subculture in 1980s New York, where Black and Latino drag queens competed for recognition in private tournaments while representing their unofficial families. It’s hectic and not always subtle, but the show does what its historic subjects did: it claims space for the marginalised and lets their stories resonate.\\n Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.

       "  'description': 'This wrap of shows across the Melbourne International Comedy Festival includes “a ripper of a show”, a performer who is surely a lock for best newcomer, a show in progress from the greatest comedian of his generation, a tropical holiday (sort of), a promising sketch performer, one of the best mental health jokes of the festival so far, stories of amorous kangaroos, an extremely impressive debut and plenty more.\\n COMEDY\\nGillian Cosgriff | Actually Good ★★★★½\\nThe Butterfly Club, until April 23\\n A lockdown-themed show of sorts may seem unfashionable in 2023, but not in the deft hands of Gillian Cosgriff, returning to the comedy festival for the first time since 2018 – mostly because it functions as a mere frame to explore what’s actually good in life. Each night, Cosgriff solicits her audience to find out their top 10 likes – all of which she notes down in a self-professed “book of tiny delights”.\\n Interspersed with this gentle form of audience participation are humorous anecdotes and highly infectious, clever, original songs that Cosgriff belts out about her own likes while her hands move across her keyboard at a dizzying pace. Cosgriff’s a whip-smart, quick-witted, confident performer.\\n It becomes clear towards the end that what undergirds the show is a simultaneous sense of sorrow and joy – it’s a credit to Cosgriff that she can hold space for both, leaving audiences with an incredibly affirming (and funny) show that marvels in the tiny profundities that make up our lives.\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n COMEDY\\nPatrick Golamco | Pork Adobo\\nTrades Hall, until April 23\\n Patrick Golamco is surely a lock for a Best Newcomer nomination this festival.\\n Having come runner-up in the 2021 RAW Comedy National Grand Final, and storming Comedy Zone in 2022, his debut Melbourne solo show is loosely tied together by a story of visiting his 99-year-old grandmother in Manila to let her know he loves her while she may be on her deathbed.\\n Through song, breakneck-speed jokes and tales of therapy gone awry, he harnesses the neurotic, introverted nature of Luke McGregor, the shake-your-head puns of Tim Vine and the pull-the-rug-from-your-feet energy of Mitch Hedberg all at once.\\n There are sharp jabs at Catholics, his Chinese upbringing, and of course, tales of the titular recipe – all which are delivered with the aplomb of a festival veteran.\\n At only 40 minutes in length it’s on the leaner side of shows this year. But for those who prefer quality over quantity, you simply can’t miss it.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nComedy Zone\\nTrades Hall, until April 23\\n A five-dish taster, the hand-picked lineup of Comedy Zone decided by festival staff is a glimpse of the future stars of Australian comedy.\\n Hosted by AJ Lamarque, he turned the camp up to a degree that would make Joel Creasey blush with stories of coming out and being mixed-race. Ben Hunter shared his love of playing goal defence in netball and hesitation to hang out his clothes; Samuel Gebreselassie delivered deeply dark material of why Ethiopia is now famous for aviation disasters rather than famine; and Annie Boyle’s delivery was so dry that it left the audience parched. That said, a brilliantly employed dance move quenched the thirst in mere moments.\\n Alexandra Hudson delivered the strongest set of the evening honing in on her disabilities. However, 80% of her material was verbatim from her televised RAW Comedy-winning performance last year. If you’re yet to see it – don’t until after the show.\\n A well-rounded evening, but not as strong as previous years.\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nDaniel Kitson | I Shall Have a Good Think When Everybody’s Gone Home\\nMalthouse Theatre, until April 23\\n If you know, you know.\\n In 2002, Daniel Kitson took home the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 2007, he won the top gong at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. If the rules allowed you to win more than once, he’d have another half-dozen on his mantelpiece.\\n Make no mistake – Kitson is the greatest comedian of his generation. Even if his aversion to press, media and podcasts means the majority have never heard of him. When other comedians see him perform, often they consider quitting the art form, knowing that they’ll never reach the same heights. It’s known as a term within the cognoscenti as “the Kitson effect”.\\n Does this all sound sycophantic? Probably. But is it hyperbole? Absolutely not.\\n A poll conducted by Dave, a TV channel that is a subsidiary of BBC, saw British comics including the ilk of Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee, Tim Vine, Mark Watson, Jason Byrne and Greg Davies all agreeing that he reigned supreme.\\n The sold-out audience for the stuttering Brit’s latest 90-minute show at 12pm on a Sunday is filled to the brim with other award-winning comics from the festival watching on.\\n The show is a masterclass of delivery, quips and callbacks. Be it comparing his own work to a pavlova, keeping an audience member as a time-keeper or heartbreakingly cutting observations on the human condition – he’s armed with a vocabulary and wit that could rival Shakespeare.\\n All are delivered with rapid-fire articulation and multi-layered gags – and the interspersed crowd-work and reactionary exchanges are phenomenal.\\n Melbourne has long been his testing ground. If this is what he’s calling (read: deliberately underselling) as a work in progress, it’s near impossible to think how good the final product will be.\\n This is stand-up at its very finest. All for a measly $20.\\n Book yesterday, thrice.\\n Then you’ll know.\\n★★★★½\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n CABARET\\nAlice Tovey | Not Like the Other Ghouls\\nMalthouse – The Tower, until April 9\\n Channelling the wounded rage of Carrie, doused in pig blood, and the extreme camp of Courteney Cox’s absurd fringe in Scream 3, Alice Tovey, in a Ghostface leather corset dress, is not having a good night.\\n Playing a version of herself that’s hosting a spooktacular dinner theatre show at Frankenstein’s Palace, she has to cope with headliners dying en route. Now a meta one-woman show, Tovey stitches her generously vulnerable cabaret into a musical ode to teenage years of self-doubt, when she sought refuge in the queer otherness of horror movies.\\n Tovey’s mum pulled her out of school to read Twilight finale Breaking Dawn, after all, and she was just as much into mopey vampire boyfriends \\xadas fight-back final girls. But just who is that demanding, discombobulated voice in her head that sounds a lot like a Aussie Hollywood A-lister? There’s a lot going on here, and it’s all ghoulishly good.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nScout Boxall | Turbo Lover\\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 23\\n Scout Boxall is what happens if you’re raised on a diet of educational media, including the nightly news, Oregon Trail, the history channel, and Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing: an adult with a true crime and conspiracy theory obsession – one not killed off by working for five years as a court reporter.\\n Who doesn’t love conspiracy theories and true crime? Not this audience, who are thrilled to banter about their favourites and hear about Boxall’s.\\n This night was heavy on audience interaction. Boxall managed to take even the most banal responses and weave magic.\\n Turbo Lover is broadly about romance and love which Boxall claims are a mystery to them, but their material about being a non-binary bisexual finds favour with the crowd that loves it all, from the relateable to the risqué.\\n Their take on this universal material provides weird and wonderful truisms you can’t imagine any other performer pulling off.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY & THEATRE\\nLou Wall | vs. The Internet\\nACMI, until April 9\\n At six foot four, dripping Y2K vibes and geometrically precise braids, Lou Wall could be the Eureka Tower of Melbourne comedy. If only our architecture was as weird, queer and extremely online.\\n Of course this country kid was denied the internet until their mid-teens. Who else could nail the sorry-not-sorry ambivalence we all feel towards digital life? Wall’s envy of a schoolmate was turbo-charged by social media, but this is theatre, not therapy, and that jealous energy fuels a 120bpm multimedia onslaught that refuses to settle into any one genre, tone or voice.\\n Example: an early bit about an innocent Insta post seamlessly shifts into a hilarious exchange with an online foot fetishist that again morphs into a Lizzo-esque musical number as wrong as the whole thing is real.\\n The show’s Shyamalan-level twist ending proves that for all its high-wire lunacy, Wall is as sure-footed as they come.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by John Bailey\\n COMEDY\\nLaura Davis | Well Don’t Just Stand There Dancing\\nCampari House, until April 23\\n “If you’ve seen me before, I’ve changed,” says Laura Davis standing before us in pale chinos, denim shirt, red kerchief, and wide-brimmed hat. It’s not just the outfit.\\n Since last performing in Melbourne, Davis has been altered, as many of us have, by a pandemic and the curveballs of this new world we live in. Things are less predictable, more disorienting. Alarming things happen.\\n With a hectic pace, Davis veers between topics as varied as Jurassic Park, collecting rocks, and dispatching spiders, dropping in and out of character while delivering laughs that seem only tangentially related. It’s anarchic and the audience is with her all the way.\\n As the show unfolds, unravels, tangles, untangles and turns back on itself, we are brought full circle and Davis’ skill at weaving a story you didn’t know you were being told is unveiled. It’s remarkable and gratifying in equal measure.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nClara Cupcakes | Yee Howdy Rides Again\\nMalthouse Theatre, Playbox, until April 9\\n With looks like American drag queen Trixie Mattel and zany humour like Lucille Ball, Clara Cupcakes’ Yee Howdy Rides Again is a knee-slapping good time.\\n Dressed in a red hat, pink plaid shirt, denim shorts, cow-print boots, dark leather holster with a banana, then topped off with a bolo tie fastened with a cupcake slide, this camp one-woman show is a theatre western riding high on its theme.\\n The production incorporates a cardboard cactus called “Clara Cactus Face”, animated projector fire, elaborate costumes and whiplash sound effects, transporting audiences on a thrilling adventure that uses patriarchal cowboy culture and “cowpitalism” as a metaphor for feminist ideals.\\n Cupcakes is a versatile performer, transitioning between clowning, burlesque, improvisation, song and mime, adapting to sound and prop mishaps without faltering. Reliance on audience participation is always a risk, but Cupcakes’ guided cues enable a comfortable interaction.\\n So, giddy up! You’re in for a wild ride.\\n★★★★½\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nJames Nokise\\nCampari House, until April 23\\n One performer, one microphone, and one hour of straight stand-up resulting in sore cheeks for the audience. This is a ripper of a show.\\n Nokise, eponymous fancy man, makes it look easy as he freewheels between tales about himself, his Samoan family and his home country of Aotearoa (New Zealand) as only a performer with this level of skill can do. These deeply personal stories demonstrate a remarkable ability to draw the political from the personal in a way that avoids proselytising and endears him to the audience.\\n In his home country, he is known not only as a brilliant stand-up but as the host of mental health podcast Eating Fried Chicken in the Shower. His material about this potentially difficult topic is empathetic, well-handled and, yes, funny. No small feat.\\n Nokise’s years of experience delivering award-winning performances are evident in his comfort on stage and disarmingly charming delivery. A delight.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY & CABARET\\nMel & Sam | High Pony\\nThe Toff at Curtin House, until April 12\\n A line of purple netball bibs strung against the back curtain sets the scene for a show-stopping introductory song-and-dance number about sports culture.\\n Award-winning performers and podcast hosts Samantha Andrew and Mel O’Brien deliver a high-energy, seamless cabaret show with non-stop laughs that’ll make your cheeks hurt. Dressed in ’90s girl band-inspired outfits with high ponytails, black midriff halter necks, flared black and neon pants and bright eye shadow, they deliver musical hit after hit that has the audience in fits of laughter.\\n Featuring tunes about Where’s Wally, babies being cancelled and lesbians not getting “the ick”, they hilariously mock queer stereotypes from their own perspectives and experiences. Swift and simple costume changes also ensure limited respite from the lols.\\n A fitting sequel to Shit-Wrecked! (2022 MICF), Andrew and O’Brien have great on-stage synchronicity, chemistry and banter.\\n A chart-topping parody pop duo in the making.\\n★★★★★\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nDiana Nguyen | Going All In\\nMelbourne Town Hall – The Flag Room, until April 23\\n Stereotypes harm us all, but the joyous Diana Nguyen is empowered – thanks to expensive breathing classes and an extensive range of dildos – to reclaim the “Asians can’t swim” slur.\\n She’s leapt headlong into roiling oceans to feign surfing proficiency to net not one, but two boyfriends (at separate times), all while being a prime candidate for Bondi Rescue who can’t float in a swimming pool. Often snort-laughing at her own (saucy) jokes, Nguyen is a hoot who can sweep even the most blush-prone audience into her silliness.\\n If the show’s a bit loose, it all hangs (10) together in the end, with a powerful undercurrent beneath the surface of this generous-hearted hilarity. A trigger warning that there will be intergenerational trauma content washes up in the final lap, as the threads of family and the indomitable spirit of her Vietnamese mum, who came to Melbourne as a refugee, leave you beaming.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nBrendan Wan | Yummy Yummy Cha Cha!\\nTIC Swanston (The Nicholas Building), until April 9\\n Brendan Wan isn’t interested in dissecting the Chinese-Australian migrant experience in his debut solo sketch comedy show – and fair enough. There are plenty of comedians who do just that.\\n His interests lie more in the realm of the absurd and surreal, manifesting in the 10-plus sketches that make up his high-energy, hour-long show.\\n A member of the Chinese crime syndicate Hutong Dragons delivers a presentation on how the group can make themselves more inclusive (a definite standout of the show that has the audience in stitches). A rendition of a perennial favourite karaoke song goes wrong. Appearances by Wan’s “stuntman” Rusty Lopez are another highlight – his spot-on impersonation of a certain Australian comedic trio is so startlingly accurate, it elicits uproarious laughter.\\n The punchlines of many of Wan’s sketches are in the set-up, but certain premises feel underdeveloped and go on for too long. However, as a debut comedy show it shows promise – Wan is a sketch comedian to watch.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n COMEDY\\nLuke Heggie | Grot\\nMorris House, until April 23\\n “This country’s built on theft,” quips Luke Heggie, positioning himself as an anti-left, anti-right, no-BS anthropological commentator who has a few things to get off his angry chest.\\n There is no knowing wink. No applause breaks. No sip of water.\\n Grot is line after line of lacerating truth about this ridiculous, ugly and (sure) lucky country we inhabit. Following last year’s magnum opus, Lowbreed, Heggie’s new set is another scathing critique on Australia’s class system, face-palm hypocrisy and the way we’ve veered into an era where the most flexible people in the country – those who do yoga etc – “are also the most useless”.\\n The crowd were in hysterics at what a mental health day really is (I won’t spoil it) and, apart from a spotty bit on Indonesia (which will be ironed out across the 42 performances he’s doing), this is a perfect hour of sharp, slaying-them-in-the-aisles, stand-up comedy.\\n Surely, an early contender for most outstanding show of the festival.\\n★★★★½\\nReviewed by Mikey Cahill\\n COMEDY\\nStephen Hall | Letters From My Heroes\\nACMI, until April 23\\n Never meet your heroes. Or in Stephen Hall’s case, never write to them.\\n Over 50 minutes, Hall reads the fictitious responses from celebrities that he has reached out to for advice: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jack Nicholson, Rodney Rude, Billy Connolly and a host of deceased names – Thomas Edison, Sean Connery.\\n It’s a flimsy concept at best. At its worst, it’s nothing more than an excuse for Hall to deliver an abundance of impressions.\\n Ironically, the strongest moment of the show highlights its weaknesses – when Hall screens a real impromptu vox pop with his father who abandoned his family during his childhood. It’s a bittersweet moment of sincerity that no impression could ever match.\\n While his ability to manipulate his voice is impressive, those hoping to witness the type of satirical whiplash that he’s previously delivered on arguably Australia’s best comedy of the past decade (Mad As Hell) will be left underwhelmed.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nAnne Edmonds | Why Is My Bag All Wet?\\nComedy Theatre, until April 23\\n All it took was an apocalypse for Helen Bidou’s real-life alter-ego to capture her Welsh boyfriend.\\n When lockdowns lifted, she held onto him the good old-fashioned way: by getting pregnant. Her words, not mine, in a riotous hour of “I’m a mum now, can you believe it?” that sees the award-winning comedian reach heights almost as delirious as her Get Krack!n counterpart, including a lesson in how best to slouch down a wall drunk.\\n She’ll whip you from doom-scrolling Facebook Marketplace through to sequestering a defective high-chair from a troll coven in Edinburgh, and on to a regrettable incident in a two-storey Coles Local in the NSW capital that has her pondering why they don’t just drain the harbour for more real estate?\\n If new motherhood isn’t the freshest show idea, then Edmond’s hurricane-force edge-of-hysteria humour sells it, delivering the kind of high you get from the good drugs in hospital.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nChloe Petts, Rob Auton, Huge Davies | New Order\\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 23\\n New Order brings three of the UK’s newest, most original and best unknown-to-Australia comedians to the festival.\\n Chloe Petts delivers the most straightforward set of the trio, opening the night describing the joys of being a masculine lesbian in self-deprecating fashion. Having good-naturedly made herself a target, she then turns her attention towards the English-Australian relationship, sports fans, and bantering with the frankly odd audience.\\n Rob Auton has a lackadaisical presence, dispensing observational material with a side-serving of the absurd. Add in a dash of poetry combining melancholy and humour, and you have a unique fusion that leaves the audience pleasurably baffled.\\n Huge Davies ends the night with deadpan delivery and a keyboard that he wields to deliver musical comedy and comedy about music, both of which have a delicious dark streak.\\n With 15-20 minutes per performer, the material is tight and the variety proves a strength.\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nSam Campbell | Every Single Emotion\\nMax Watt’s, until April 23\\n Sydney crackpot Sam Campbell is on a tear.\\n In the past five years he’s scaled the highest heights in comedy by winning the top gongs at Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2018 and last year’s Edinburgh Fringe.\\n Every Single Emotion is not so much a return to earth as a madcap hour of swerving, unnerving LOLs that needs lots of tightening up but is still undeniably Cambo (read: utterly brilliant, constantly wrong-footing and spectacular value for money).\\n Playing his biggest room yet, Campbell’s demonic voice modifier and extra shouty approach engage the crowd well.\\n A mid-show cameo from a fellow comic lands nicely as he bags out The Hundred with Andy Lee and professes a desire to be on another more successful panel show. Just imagine.\\n He’s on fire when he riffs on Jason Statham’s culinary skills and Christian O’Connell’s odd level of fame, while a Pet Barn bit needs to be neutered. Wait for his call-back to The Three Ls – it’s classic Campbell, where you think everything has gone pear-shaped but in fact it’s all cool bananas.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Mikey Cahill\\n COMEDY\\nKirsty Webeck | A Bit of Fun\\nThe Westin Three, until April 23\\n If you’ve accidentally been hoodwinked into going to the ballet by anyone pulling the “fun voice”, the last thing you’ll want to do is squish into a pair of tights, get up on stage and perform a pas de deux.\\n Kirsty (never Kristy, maaaybe Kransky) knows this, and that Swan Lake is too long. So if you love short and snappy comedy gigs with a great deal of heart but are terrified of audience participation, relax, you’re in safe hands.\\n An animal farm of content, from shocking rat attacks to the unfortunate fate of sperm whales, unfolds. Webeck’s obsessed with naming our furry friends and will take it personally if you don’t let her, even if it’s your second birthday (firsts are just dumb). There are busloads of LOLs to be had in a show that, unlike the ballet, isn’t flashy but will leave you wheeze-laughing a great deal more.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Stephen A Russell\\n COMEDY\\nDane Simpson\\nComedy Republic, until April 10\\n Dane Simpson named his show Always Was, Always Will Be…Funny on a whim, but it’s easy to imagine the funny kid he was when watching the cheeky, likeable performer he is now.\\n The show centres on Simpson’s recent life experiences and relationships, and his material remains personal even when it explores the more political aspects of life as a Gamilaraay man.\\n He sometimes uses short videos and pictures to help illustrate his material, but this is essentially a classic stand-up show with wordplay, callbacks and quippy one-liners in between longer stories.\\n He isn’t the only funny one in his family, and his delight in sharing their antics is contagious. Simpson appears to be having as much fun as the audience as he giggles at his own jokes, inviting the room to laugh along with him.\\n His personable delivery creates a natural rapport that results in steady laughter and applause.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nLucinda Price and Louis Hanson | Besties\\nTrades Hall – Solidarity Hall (show’s run is now complete)\\n Besties is an intimate slumber party filled with storytelling, confessions, witty banter and deliberately dorky singing and dancing.\\n Originally from Melbourne, comedians and creators Lucinda Price and Louis Hanson return home to a loving audience of social media fans, childhood friends and family. Dressed in Hello Kitty pyjamas, Price and Hanson get vulnerable, sharing parts of themselves yet to be disclosed – even on their respective Instagram and TikTok accounts. Price’s divulgence about a sexual encounter with an unnamed celebrity will leave audiences googling on the trip home.\\n From footage of embarrassing gigs to a fake image with an ex’s ex, their wizardry in video editing and Photoshop adds a meme aspect to the show, representative of their work at Pedestrian TV and as online personalities.\\n Witnessing Price and Hanson’s close-knit kinship feels like a warm hug, inviting the audience into a three-way call that you never want to end.\\n★★★★★\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nNina Oyama and Jude Perl | We Should Hang Out!\\nThe Westin Three, March 31 (show’s run is now complete)\\n Six comedians, one hour. What better way to spend three nights at the comedy festival? (n.b. this show’s run ended on April 1).\\n Nina Oyama, with her effortless charm and affable on-stage persona, and Jude Perl, with her virtuosic combination of dark humour, remarkable keyboard skills and a killer voice to match, are the hosts of a “loose and live” late-night variety show – featuring four comedic acts as divergent in their styles as their hosts are.\\n The jokes come a mile a minute in Suren Jayemanne’s confident set, spanning topics as varied as gentrification, rescue dogs and accents. Heath Franklin has the crowd on edge by deliberately wading into taboo territory, but subverts expectations in surprising ways. Aurelia St Clair’s languid, ASMR-pleasing delivery is responsible for perhaps one of the best mental health jokes of the festival thus far. And rounding it out is Frankie McNair as the sultry, chain-smoking Tabatha Booth, cleverly interweaving her off-kilter humour with burlesque.\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n COMEDY\\nRose Bishop | Feral\\nChinese Museum, until April 9\\n Rose Bishop is a feral.\\n What is a feral? In Bishop’s view, it’s a term to depict the lower-socioeconomic class that she grew up around in regional Western Australia. Ferals will get drunk enough to ruin Christmas (but not bash anyone); ferals will get vaccinated as long as it’s covered by Medicare.\\n Directed by festival mainstay Claire Hooper, Bishop’s debut solo hour is a patchwork of stories about her own feral-ness – be it tales of an amorous kangaroo that she took in as a pet, looking after a greyhound allergic to its own teeth, aiming to always have sex on the first date or inheriting trauma instead of property.\\n Oh, and a frankly absurd anecdote about spending time on a billionaire sheikh’s super-yacht with snarky Russian sex workers. We’ve all been there, right?\\n While there is an over-reliance on expletives for laughs, Bishop’s well-structured storytelling and confident delivery makes for an impressive debut.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY & CABARET\\nAli McGregor | Late-Nite Variety-Nite Night\\nThe Famous Spiegeltent at Arts Centre Melbourne, March 31 (on until April 9)\\n At an indeterminate point in time, Ali McGregor’s Late-Night Variety-Nite Night reached cult status.\\n For 16 years, the soprano has plucked a melange of comedy and cabaret acts from a massive trove for a 75-minute showcase. Each evening, there’s a different haul.\\n A tight band of keyboards, drums and bass welcomes McGregor into the hazy lights of The Famous Spiegeltent – an ideal venue for such a show.\\n Not quite seamlessly, the acts pour onto the tiny stage.\\n First-up is comedian-actor Diana Nguyen, followed by hyper-expressive acrobat-artist Jess Love and her jaw-dropping hula-hoop set.\\n Comic/songwriter Gillian Cosgriff enchants with a keyboard takeover, skipping through a joyous observational score that lets rip.\\n Stand-up Carl Donnelly entrances with a 12-minute shower gel discussion.\\n McGregor, interspersing the acts with soaring, melodic mash-ups, describes it as a “bargain of a show”. Spot on.\\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\\n COMEDY & THEATRE\\nOsher Gunsberg | Night Time News Network National News\\nMalthouse Theatre – Beckett Theatre, until April 9\\n Osher Gunsberg drops his sanitised reality TV host persona for an evening of participatory theatre that satirises live news.\\n Performing alongside a ragtag Sydney-based improv troupe, unique headlines are written prior to each show, acting as a live prompt similar to Whose Line Is It, Anyway?\\n Gunsberg is dressed as a Ron Burgundy-esque news anchor in a pink suit and orange-rimmed glasses. His prologue – projected loudly in signature fashion – contextualises the show, laying the groundwork for a future commercial television pitch.\\n Incorporating live crosses and crew interactions, there’s inconsistency across the performers in their ability to deliver convincing news segments. Alex Reynolds and Orya Golgowsky are standouts in their world building, characterisations, facial expressions and physical comedy – getting the largest laughs in any sketch.\\n Reminiscent of The Chaser, this is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy show that could be ripped (but for liability reasons is not) straight from the headlines.\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nOpening Night Comedy Allstars Supershow\\nPalais Theatre, March 29\\n\\n A 150-minute melange of taste-testers, the annual Allstars Supershow delivers the audience bite-sized teasers to satiate every form of the comedic palate. This year, to mixed results.\\n Hannah Gadsby took on compering duties, and warmed the crowd with reflections of her recent marriage to her former tour manager. Anne Edmonds opened proceedings with her regular polemic style – shooting daggers at D-grade celebrities who seek fame on reality TV and commercial radio. Dilruk Jayasinha followed by bringing up the cricket rivalry between Australia and his home country of Sri Lanka – and the uneasy fact that his mother fancied the late Shane Warne.\\n On the international front, the beat-boxing skills of the Icelandic Ari Eldjarn landed soundly; American Kyle Kinane took shots at himself when referencing the January 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol and the social faux pas that comes with buying a telescope; and New Zealander Guy Montgomery skewered the Bechdel test and explained the difficulty of implementing it into his everyday life. All to uproarious effect.\\n Similarly, Douglas Lim, Anirban Dasgupta, Leo Reich and The Lucas Bros all easily won over the crowd – albeit it with a vastly ranging difference of styles.\\n Best Newcomer at Edinburgh Festival Fringe Lara Ricote delivered the most risque gag of the evening – regarding cysts in her reproductive organs and an abortion. It slayed the room. If the ABC actually air it during their broadcast next week, I wouldn’t want to be working in their complaints department.\\n Among all the well-placed bullseyes, there were of course a few that failed to hit the board.\\n David O’Doherty’s ongoing cheap keyboard shtick elicited yawns; Bronwyn Kuss’ never-ending repetitions about Tina Arena well overstayed its welcome; and Huge Davies’ barbs and impressions about modern-day dance music read the room about as well as Tommy Wiseau.\\n Georgie Carroll’s anecdotes about rotator cuff tears went down like a balloon over the seas of South Carolina; and headline grabber Reuben Kaye doubled down upon his recent controversy with Catholics by employing juxtapositions about the church, priests and drag queens. Clever enough, but you could see the punchlines coming from St Kilda Road.\\n Concluding the evening, Dave Thornton scored the highest decibels of applause of the night with a sharp attack at King Charles and for a proposition of vasectomies versus IQ levels.\\n A few lulls aside, inevitable in such a gargantuan event, the merriment of this year’s Allstars Supershow lit the fuse to set off the celebratory firework of more than 600 shows across the city over the next month.\\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\\n COMEDY\\nElyce Phillips | Pretends to Be On Tropical Holiday For 50 Minutes (Definitely Not A Scam)\\nThe Butterfly Club, until April 7\\n Elyce Phillips has only been staying at premium luxury resort Poseidon Sands for a day. Or has she?\\n Featuring an elaborate mix of gross-out hijinks, well-crafted props and costumes, and sophisticated multimedia (no doubt drawing on Phillips’ other hat as an illustrator), nothing is immune from censure in Phillips’ delightfully chaotic, multilayered show.\\n The show’s episodic structure has Phillips oscillating between a bikini-clad tourist, a sea cucumber and the unwilling assistant of a chauvinistic big wet ham – among other characters – while the sound and light design effortlessly shifts the tonal register between sequences.\\n Phillips is a master at pulling the rug out from under her audience – nothing is what it seems at the ramshackle Poseidon Sands, too far from the beach to be anything other than the ‘jewel of the inner coast’.\\n The Butterfly Club, with its tightly packed pews and haunted tiki bar vibe, is the perfect setting for its unravelling.\\n★★★★\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair \\n COMEDY\\nBec Petraitis | Merry\\nCampari House, until April 9\\n The carols are pumping, the decorations are hung and the stage is set for the tale of Bec Petraitis’ Christmas Day, 2021, her worst on record.\\n It’s true, the Christmas in question was not that bad – something Petraitis is quick to point out when she promises at the outset nobody died. However, amid the COVID years, our tolerance for disappointment was low, and Petraitis is quite the Christmas fan.\\n What follows is a series of unfortunate events told with the aid of dramatic inner monologues, neat stagecraft, and a knack for storytelling.\\n With her expressive face and charming style, Petraitis’ tally of dissatisfactions brings frequent laughs of both recognition and sympathy. There are understated punchlines dispensed with dry wit and the occasional diversion into silliness, which delight the audience.\\n Here’s a performer who keeps the laughs rolling, the snark light and the atmosphere warm – just like a good Christmas.\\n★★★\\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\\n COMEDY\\nCourtney Crisfield | Cult Classic\\nQueen Victoria Women’s Centre, until April 18\\n You know that friend who always speaks in film quotes? That’s Courtney Crisfield.\\n In her own words, she was raised by movies, spawning a multi-faceted show featuring trivia, short films and costumed portrayals of recognisable characters that cinephiles would relish.\\n Parodying genres from horror to silent films, Crisfield disarms the audience with her awkward nerdiness, unafraid to call out the derivative nature of new cinema.\\n A working actor, the short films – in which Crisfield also stars – show off her acting chops, playing beloved protagonists from David Bowie in Labyrinth to Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind.\\n Cult Classic relies heavily on the make-shift cinema projector and it’s clear Crisfield has invested a lot into the film production aspects of the show. However, more weighting towards the live stand-up component would have made it more balanced.\\n Crisfield delivers an endearing Oscar-worthy performance that successfully convinces us why she’ll always love … movies.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\\n COMEDY\\nUrvi Majumdar | Urvi Went To An All Girls School\\nTrades Hall – Common Rooms Bar, until April 2\\n Urvi Majumdar reprises her debut solo show from 2022 for just four nights between the light-studded, grandiose purple curtains of the Common Rooms Bar. The setting evokes the same feeling as a high school formal – incidentally the pivotal event that foregrounds Majumdar’s recollection of her teenage years.\\n Reading verbatim from real-life journal entries out of a comically oversized stage prop diary, Majumdar swings between acting out her adolescent fears and humiliations and retrospectively examining these ordeals through an adult lens.\\n Her experience growing up as a first-generation Indian-Australian in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne is joyfully resurrected through Majumdar’s animated, confident storytelling and endearingly pithy quips – though she has the tendency to needlessly over-explain her well-crafted punchlines.\\n Majumdar’s deftly re-enacted MSN Messenger conversations, intentionally cringe dance sequences executed with the fist bump of an iPod and a jaunty noughties soundtrack has the audience laughing in shared recognition of a fraught but memorable period of heightened emotions and thwarted desires.\\n★★★½\\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\\n The Melbourne International Comedy Festival is on now until April 23.

       "  'description': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\n Firelight\\nJohn Morrissey, Text, $32.99\\n\\nFirst Nations fiction and sci-fi might sound like strange bedfellows, although anyone who saw the Shadow Spirit exhibition at Melbourne’s Rising festival this year (which featured First Nations Star Wars characters alongside ancient stories and cultural knowledge) will know how fertile their conjunction can be. Kalkadoon author John Morrissey has produced a suite of short stories – some of them sci-fi, most within the realms of magical realist or speculative fiction – that investigate colonialism and identity with a keen eye and an uninhibited imagination. It’s a volume that features a little green man and the colonisation of the Moon, fraught attempts by scientists to reconstruct a thylacine, and a Gothic-tinged revenge fantasy in which an Aboriginal warrior haunts the white explorer responsible for his murder. An elegant and unpretentious narrative style allows Morrissey to reach for outlandish or bizarre elements with the irreducible impact of a lucid dream. It’s a fable-like, inventive, and well-crafted collection.\\n Serengotti\\nEugen Bacon, Transit Lounge, $32.99\\n Eugen Bacon’s Serengotti follows Ch’anzu, a gender-nonconforming narrator, on a day from hell. Ch’anzu loses hir job, and walks in (totally hungover) on hir wife Scarlet having pneumatic sex with a guy half her age. The opening chapters are set in contemporary Melbourne but there’s a hyperactive buzz of disorientation and dislocation in the prose, which has a futuristic feel and surges forward using the unusual second-person perspective. You’re put into Ch’anzu’s shoes as hir life crisis leads first to the wisdom of Aunt Mae, and on to a migrant African community, Serengotti, deep in the Australian bush. Eugen Bacon has a propulsive experimental style that voraciously incorporates idiom from urban, internet, Australian and African contexts to forge something new. Momentum builds quickly in this rush of a novel, which illuminates questions of gender and race as they are experienced, and has a sharper focus on how the world turns in urban Australia than most new fiction.\\n Prophet\\nHelen Macdonald & Sin Blache, Jonathan Cape, $34.99\\n Co-written during lockdown by Helen Macdonald (H is for Hawk) and Sin Blache, Prophet literally weaponises nostalgia. The title refers to a military-grade chemical that causes those exposed to it to fall into a nostalgic trance, creating figments of the past from treasured memories. Naturally, such a weapon could be disastrous in the wrong hands. And perhaps there are no right hands, as two agents – super-buff American action hero Adam, and dissolute but sharp-minded Rao, a former British intelligence operative – discover. Following Prophet’s destructive trail from Britain to the American West, it seems Prophet has new properties waiting to be unleashed. This sci-fi queer romance espionage thriller smashes together a bewildering array of genre fiction tropes, but it’s obsessively crafted, and has the kind of philosophical underpinning that makes it read more like postmodern fabulism than fanfic.\\n Temperance\\nCarol Lefevre, Wakefield, $34.95\\n It’s 1963 and widowed café owner Stella Madigan struggles to make ends meet after the death of her husband. The arrival of unconventional artist Mardi Rose promises a reprieve from working-class life for Stella and her young children, Fran and Theo, but when they embark upon a road trip to Byron Bay, they make it only as far as the tiny hamlet of Temperance in the Australian Outback. There, a horrifying and half-remembered incident turns the family back, and it will plague the children into their adult lives. Award-winning writer Carol Lefevre has a deft touch for psychological drama and the intricacies of domestic relationships. Here she takes a tightly stretched working-class canvas and loosens it into an evolving mystery (and a deferred coming-of-age tale) spanning decades. Lefevre is particularly good at showing the subtle effects of trauma, and the intensity of repressed emotion.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nBeeswax and Tall Tales\\nJane Crowley with Athol Salter, Ventura Press, $32.99\\n This polished collection of tales from the antiques trade could easily have been sub-titled “Life’s Little Ironies”, for the way it reflects human foibles in all their variety. Jane Crowley’s father, Athol Salter, has spent a lifetime buying and selling antiques and throughout that time continually shared the stories he gathered along the way with his daughter. Written from her father’s point of view, the stories are full of intriguing characters, from shifty types who get their comeuppance, a sad widower in Wagga whose last wish before suiciding is denied him by big-city lawyers, and a Welsh collector whose dying business is, to an extent, emblematic of the trade. And all of them revolving around selling artefacts, be it a bath, a chiffonier or an old farm table. Lovingly crafted and sure-footed, this could become a collector’s item.\\n Girls [Don’t] Play Sport\\nChloe Dalton, Allen & Unwin, $34.99\\n When Chloe Dalton was young watching her brothers play rugby she would practise kicking at half-time, often being told by adults that she should play the game. Her reply was, “Girls don’t play rugby”. In 2016 she won Olympic rugby gold in Rio. Her journey, her successes and her experience inform this combination of treatise and memoir. It also provides a snapshot of women in sport, citing, say, the struggle that swimming legend Fanny Durack had to get to the 1912 Olympics. In what is basically a call to arms she highlights the achievements, and prejudices that women’s sport still faces: pay, training facilities, misogyny, trolling and the reaction to the now iconic photo of Tayla Harris goaling from the 50-metre mark. Deeply passionate, her enthusiasm is infectious, and we can only hope one day nobody will think twice about girls playing footy – or any other sport, for that matter.\\n The Chipilly Six: Unsung Heroes of the Great War\\nLucas Jordan, NewSouth, $34.99\\n It takes a certain type of larrikin daredevil to do what six Australians soldiers did in the middle of the Battle of Amiens in August 1918. The allied offensive had been stopped by a line of German machine gunners on the spur above the Somme village of Chipilly. Repeated frontal assaults had failed. During the morning sergeants Jack Hayes and Harold Andrews went for a “stroll” into the village looking for souvenirs – as you do. That night they led a patrol of six, flanked the German gunners and took them out, capturing 71 prisoners and nine machine guns – achieving what an entire army couldn’t. It’s impossible to read this ripping, vivid recreation of events without shaking your head in disbelief. For years history paid scant attention to the “six”. This account (covering post-war years) and drawing on firsthand testimony corrects that.\\n The Shrinking Nation\\nGraeme Turner, UQP, $32.99\\n This is a sort of report card on Australian politics over the past 15 years, and it’s not good. The phrase “must try harder” comes to mind. Australia and the world have changed enormously in that time, but our national governments have gone missing in vital areas such as climate change, social welfare and closing the gap. The period, especially from Tony Abbott’s government on, was marked by what we might call policy paralysis, the ship of state was left to drift and the country has shrunk, so it’s “less than it was, less than it should be”. Graeme Turner’s clear, emphatic, convincing examination is a big-picture study of a time when the big picture deserted our politics. It’s also a searing indictment of decades of neo-liberalist hypocrisy. But there’s also hope, with Turner seeing positives in the busyness of the Albanese administration.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'This photograph captures a candid moment of two men, seemingly musicians David Byrne and Brian Eno, inside a Chemist Warehouse, a prominent Australian pharmacy chain. The image is rich in detail, showcasing not only the individuals but also the vibrant, bustling atmosphere of the store.\\n\\n**The Men:**\\n\\n* **David Byrne (left):**  Recognizable by his distinctive features and attire, Byrne stands slightly to the left of the frame. He is known as the former lead singer and guitarist of the influential new wave band Talking Heads. His musical career spans decades, marked by innovative work in various genres, including rock, funk, and world music.  He is also a visual artist, writer, and cyclist, known for his advocacy for urban cycling.  In the photograph, he wears a dark blazer over a dark, subtly patterned shirt and dark denim jeans. His expression is relaxed and approachable, almost as if he\\'s engaged in conversation.\\n\\n* **Brian Eno (right):**  Standing to the right, Eno, a renowned music producer, composer, and visual artist, complements Byrne\\'s presence.  Eno\\'s career is marked by pioneering work in ambient music and electronic music production. He has collaborated with numerous artists, including David Bowie, U2, and Coldplay, and is considered a highly influential figure in the music industry.  In the image, Eno wears a dark fedora, a dark blue plaid blazer, a black undershirt, and dark trousers.  He sports a full beard and a calm, almost contemplative expression.\\n\\n**The Setting: Chemist Warehouse**\\n\\nThe backdrop of the photograph is unmistakably a Chemist Warehouse. Several key visual elements confirm this:\\n\\n* **Bright Blue and Yellow Signage:** The dominant colors are the signature bright blue and yellow of the Chemist Warehouse branding. These colors are visible on the shelves, price tags, and promotional signs.\\n* **\"Cheaper @ Warehouse Prices\" Slogan:** This iconic slogan is clearly visible on yellow signs hanging from the ceiling, reinforcing the brand identity.\\n* **Product Placement and Pricing:** The shelves are stocked with a variety of health and beauty products, typical of a Chemist Warehouse.  Prominent brands like Colgate, Olay, and Nature\\'s Way are visible. The yellow price tags with black text are a characteristic feature of the store\\'s pricing strategy.\\n* **\"As Seen on TV\" Stickers:**  Many products feature circular stickers stating \"As Seen on TV,\" a common marketing tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.\\n* **\"Health Break\" Signage:**  The \"Health Break\" logo, a part of Chemist Warehouse\\'s branding for its health product sections, is visible on several shelves.\\n* **Metal Grid Shelving:** The metal grid shelving units are a standard fixture in Chemist Warehouse stores.\\n\\n**Composition and Details:**\\n\\nThe photograph is composed with the two men positioned centrally in the aisle, with shelves of products flanking them on both sides. This creates a sense of depth and draws the viewer\\'s eye towards the center. The aisle appears well-lit, likely due to fluorescent lighting typical of retail spaces.\\n\\nThe shelves are densely packed with products, creating a visually busy backdrop. The bright colors and varied packaging of the products contribute to the overall vibrancy of the scene.  The price tags, with their bold yellow and black design, stand out against the colorful products, emphasizing the store\\'s focus on value.\\n\\nThe \"3\" signs hanging from the ceiling, indicating further discounts, are a common promotional tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.  The \"Discount Chemist 50% Go\" sign suggests a sale or special offer on selected items.\\n\\nThe floor appears to be a light-colored tile, typical of retail environments.  A circular floor sticker, possibly indicating social distancing guidelines, is partially visible near Eno\\'s feet.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe photograph presents a striking juxtaposition of the two renowned musicians against the backdrop of a busy, everyday retail setting. The contrast between the artistic personas of Byrne and Eno and the commercial environment of Chemist Warehouse creates a sense of intrigue. The image captures a seemingly spontaneous moment, lending it a candid and unposed feel.  The vibrant colors, dense product displays, and prominent branding of Chemist Warehouse create a visually stimulating environment that further enhances the photograph\\'s impact. The presence of text throughout the image, from product names and prices to promotional slogans, adds another layer of detail and context. This photograph is not only a portrait of two influential musicians but also a snapshot of a particular time and place, capturing the essence of a ubiquitous Australian retail experience.\\n'},\n",

       "  'description': 'Rome: When Travis Scott asked Rome to make some noise at the Circus Maximus on Monday, Rome cheerfully complied.\\n The 60,000-odd spectators jumped so vigorously that some locals panicked, thinking that an earthquake was underway.\\n Archaeologists were alarmed by the vibrations and questioned the wisdom of holding musical events at an ancient site, where chariot races were held more than 2,000 years ago and to which Julius Caesar later added his own decorating touch.\\n The concert coincided with the release of Scott’s chart-topping new album, Utopia. He was joined by Ye, the rap star formerly known as Kanye West.\\n The show in Rome marked Ye’s first concert appearance after a series of antisemitic remarks on social media and in interviews last year led to his expulsion from social media for a time and theseries of antisemitic remarks. When he came onstage, the crowd roared and jumped some more.\\n Romans, including those living some distance from the site, took to social media to lament shaking windows, beds and chandeliers.\\n In more recent years, the Circus Maximus has played host to major open-air rock concerts, including shows by the Rolling Stones, Lady Gaga and, this summer, Bruce Springsteen, Guns N’ Roses and Imagine Dragons.\\n The circus has also hosted the summer season of Rome’s opera.\\n Giovanni Diaferia, a seismologist at the Italian Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, calculated: “60k people, 70 kg each, jumping and reaching 0.15 m from ground radiate an energy of E = 6.2 MJ which is equivalent to a magnitude 1.3 earthquake, at each jump!! Enough to be recorded by a seismic station 9 km away.”\\n On Tuesday, the institute said in an online note that its national seismic network stations “clearly registered the enthusiasm of Travis Scott fans in concert at Circus Maximus”.\\n Similar activity was registered in 2021, when Italy won the European Championship soccer final, as well as earlier this year when Naples won the Serie A championship, the institute said.\\n In July, a Taylor Swift concert in Seattle shook the ground so hard, it registered signals roughly equivalent to a magnitude 2.3 earthquake, seismologists said.\\n A seismogram identified several points during the Scott concert, which lasted under 90 minutes, “with evident peaks of jubilation” on the part of fans, according to the institute.\\n In the aftermath, Alfonsina Russo, who oversees the Archaeological Park of the Colosseum, Rome’s most important archaeological area, called on city officials to stop using the Circus Maximus for mass events and to put it to more cultural use.\\n Russo told the AGI news agency on Tuesday that the circus was a historical monument, not a stadium, and that “mega-concerts put it at risk”.\\n Archaeological experts had given advice to the city for such events, and Russo said she had expressed concerns about the decibel levels and about spectators jumping in place.\\n “In my opinion, musical events can be held, but they should be carefully chosen like opera and ballet,” she told AGI. “Rock concerts are best held in stadiums to not endanger public safety.”\\n There was a moment of panic during the Scott show. Italian news media reported that around 60 people had to be treated for eye and throat irritation, possibly because someone used pepper spray in the crowd.\\n Nearly five years ago, pepper spray used at a nightclub, where a rapper was to perform, in the central Italian town of Corinaldo led to a stampede that killed six people and left nearly 200 people injured.\\n Attempts to reach the organisers of Scott’s concert were unsuccessful.\\n In 2021, 10 people were crushed to death and hundreds more were injured at a concert by Scott at his Astroworld Festival in Houston. Scott was investigated, but a grand jury declined to indict him or others connected to the festival. A number of lawsuits against Scott and festival organisers are pending.\\n On Wednesday, Alessandro Onorato, Rome’s City Council member responsible for tourism and events, defended the mega-concerts.\\n Beyond the money spent by concertgoers visiting from around the world, he said, fees to use the Circus Maximus for concerts last year brought 2.1 million euros, or $3.5 million, into city coffers. The funds were earmarked for the city department that maintains city-owned archaeological monuments, he added.\\n Without these fees, Roman taxpayers would have to pay up, he said in a Facebook live feed. “There were zero incidents, zero people got hurt,” he said of Scott’s concert.\\n This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'Just after Christmas, writer Hanif Kureishi was taking a long walk in Rome, where he and his wife, Isabella D’Amico, were spending the holiday, when he suddenly collapsed onto the sidewalk. It is unclear why — perhaps he fainted, said his son Carlo Kureishi, or perhaps he suffered an epileptic fit — but he fell awkwardly, twisting his neck and grievously injuring the top of his spine.\\n When Hanif Kureishi regained his senses, he was lying in a pool of blood, unable to move his arms or his legs.\\n “It occurred to me that there was no co-ordination between what was left of my mind and what remained of my body,” he wrote, via dictation, a few days later on Twitter. “I had become divorced from myself. I believed I was dying. I believed I had three breaths left.”\\n Taken to Gemelli Hospital, Kureishi spent the next several days “profoundly traumatised, altered and unrecognisable to myself”, he said on Twitter. “At the moment, it is unclear whether I will ever be able to walk again, or whether I’ll ever be able to hold a pen.”\\n Since then, Kureishi, 68, a novelist, screenwriter, playwright and director best known for My Beautiful Laundrette and The Buddha of Suburbia, has been dictating daily dispatches from his hospital bed.\\n In vivid, poignant prose, he is narrating his ongoing drama but also conjuring memories, musing about writing and art, and describing the terrifying, sometimes transcendent profundity of being dependent on the love and patience of others.\\n The posts are presented as series of tweets and also compiled as a Substack newsletter — postcards from an unfolding crisis. They have touched a nerve in readers, who have responded with practical advice, as well as messages of love, support and gratitude for what they say has been an extraordinary model of grace and imagination in the midst of calamity.\\n “We are all with you in this room, lying next to you on your trolley and staring at the ceiling tiles,” a Twitter user named Affi Parvizi-Wayne wrote. “Your beautiful writing transports us every day to your world.”\\n Kureishi first said he wanted to post something on social media a few days after the accident, his son said in an interview. “He’s not a private person in that respect,” Carlo Kureishi said. “He’s always been autobiographical in his writing.”\\n He started dictating, almost in the way of an old-time, pre-internet reporter phoning in a story to the office. (As he speaks, he notes the paragraph breaks, for example, by saying “new paragraph”.)\\n “It came out very naturally, very fluidly,” his son said. “I thought that was that.” But the first posts attracted a great deal of interest, in part because Hanif Kureishi was channelling the fears of so many readers.\\n “What happened to my dad is pretty much the event that’s uppermost in people’s minds of what they don’t want to happen to them,” Carlo Kureishi said.\\n The tweets are brave, profound, playful, lyrical, despairing and occasionally very funny. Mentioning an impending rectal exam, Hanif Kureishi recalled the last one he had, courtesy of the public National Health Service back in England. The nurse mistook him for Salman Rushdie.\\n “As the nurse flipped me over she asked me, ‘How long did it take you to write Midnight’s Children?’” Kureishi wrote. “I replied, ‘If I had indeed written Midnight’s Children, don’t you think I would have gone private?’”\\n As it happens, the two writers are old friends. “My friend Salman Rushdie, one of the bravest men I know, a man who has stood up to the most evil form of Islamofascism, writes to me every single day, encouraging patience,” Kureishi wrote in one Twitter post. “He should know,” he added, a reference to the vicious stabbing attack on Rushdie last summer. “He gives me courage.”\\n Kureishi is about to move to a specialty rehabilitation hospital, and his recovery is likely to be arduous and uncertain. After an operation on his neck to reduce some of the swelling around his spinal cord, he has regained glimmers of movement in his legs and the tips of his fingers, his son said. No one has made a definitive prognosis, though a physical therapist recently “promised that I would raise a pen again with my right hand”, Kureishi wrote on Thursday.\\n The author has been grappling daily with the recalibration of his closest relationships — with his three sons, his wife, and his ex-wife, producer Tracey Scoffield, to whom he remains close. “This bomb has also shattered the lives of those around me,” he wrote.\\n “People love to be kind and help one another,” he added. “They also resent their dependence on each other and the fact they can’t do everything for themselves. My accident was a physical tragedy, but the emotional outcomes for all of us are going to be significant, but also very interesting.”\\n In one of his posts, Kureishi talked about his love of the physical act of putting pen to paper, how he likes to “write a word, a sentence, then another sentence, until I feel something wake up inside me”.\\n “As I make these marks, I begin to hear characters speaking, and then they start speaking to each other if I’m lucky; if I’m even luckier, they might start amusing one another,” he continued. “I’m sure many painters, writers, architects, sports people and gardeners love their tools, and see their tools as an extension of their body.\\n “I hope one day I will be able to go back to using my own precious and beloved instruments.”\\n This article originally appeared in The New York Times.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'CRIME FICTION\\nDeath in the Sauna\\nDennis Altman\\nClouds of Magellan Press, $34.99\\n It’s leather night at Spartacus, a discreet London sauna that is a meeting place for gay men. It’s also two days before a Global AIDS Conference, and Pomfrey Lister, the eminent virologist, founder and President of the Global AIDS Trust, is lying naked and serenely dead in a cubicle with a half empty bottle of amyl nitrate in his hand. So begins Dennis Altman’s elegant whodunnit in which everyone, in true Agatha Christie mode, is a suspect.\\n The author of Homosexual: Oppression and Liberation, first published in 1971, Altman is a distinguished academic who has himself served on the board of many AIDS initiatives across the world. Here he draws on that experience to present a wry, poignant, restrained murder mystery that unfolds against the backdrop of a major AIDS convention in 2003. In relation to which, there’s some amusing asides about the minor royal who opens the event who would clearly much rather be at Wimbledon, and the missing wife of a central Asian despot who went shopping two days earlier and hasn’t been seen since.\\n Sadly, the man who might have managed these various hiccups is now dead. Summoned to the sauna, Pomfrey’s colleague and rival for control of the Trust, Spencer Carson, thinks it would be much better if Pomfrey were discovered at home, in bed, dead of a massive heart attack.\\n So does Mary, Pomfrey’s wife, who has yet to come to terms with her husband’s double life, and so Pomfrey’s body is immediately relocated and quickly cremated. But there are suspicions.\\n The unlikely sleuth in this telling tale is Noel, Pomfrey’s former lover. A mild-mannered second-hand bookseller, Noel just happened to spot Pomfrey’s bright red Bentley outside Spartacus on the night in question and suspects Pomfrey was cheating on him. For his own peace of mind, Noel needs to know. He thought they had made a commitment.\\n After teaming up with Sylvie, Pomfrey’s former assistant, who incidentally collects early editions of Agatha Christie novels, Noel embarks on a quest to determine Pomfrey’s fidelity, or not. Searching for the attendant who first discovered his lover’s body, Noel heads to Brighton. There he stays in the rather shabby gay bed and breakfast establishment, Brigadoon, run by the irrepressible Maurice who is rehearsing for the role of Miss Prism in the Brighton Wilde Players production ofThe Importance of Being Earnest.\\n What is so endearing and engaging about Altman’s first crime novel is that all the characters, however minor, have intricate lives and backstories that render them profoundly human, even if their motives and actions might be questionable. Take Mary, Pomfrey’s widow, who bears “a slight resemblance to Judi Dench”. Her AIDS work in Africa involving virginity and abstinence is based on her belief that sex is the cause “of so much misery.” No wonder Pomfrey strayed.\\n Altman’s touch is deft and his wit razor sharp. Agatha would have surely approved, but I’m not sure what she would have made of leather night at Spartacus.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nHow to Love Your Daughter\\nHila Blum, Bloomsbury, $32.99\\n Total estrangement between family members holds a peculiar fascination for those of us fortunate enough not to have experienced it. You’ll have no trouble imagining how even love might cause such a rift after reading Hila Blum’s How to Love Your Daughter. It begins with Yoella, spying upon her daughter Leah (and two grandchildren she has never met) having dinner in an Amsterdam suburb. She has flown from her home in Israel, many years after Leah cut her out of her life without a word, and flies back again after a tantalising glimpse of her child, determined to make sense of what went wrong between them. In this sense, it is a detective novel in which suspect and sleuth are one and the same. Disquiet builds as Yoella sifts through the past for clues, dredging up memories of her late husband Meir, and the family’s life together as Leah grew up. A tenuous hope survives this quietly observed examination of how maternal love can misfire, stifling what it strives to nurture.\\n Audition\\nPip Adam, Giramondo, $29.95\\n Three giants hurtle through the galaxy aboard the spaceship Audition. Alba, Stanley and Drew have grown and will continue to grow unless they talk, which they do unceasingly, both to restrain their alarming bodily expansion and to fuel their vessel as it searches for a new home among the stars. Blending science fiction and social realism, Pip Adam’s Audition is an audacious novel that gives voice to the marginalised and underprivileged, and as the enforced stream of chatter burgeons, it becomes clear each of the giants is a social outcast jettisoned from Earth as punishment. It can be a tough read – the dialogue writhes between small talk and desperate confession with limited insight; it often rides waves of inarticulacy. And yet this bleak experimental fable arrives at new possibilities, the implied critique of the society from which the characters have been exiled yielding to alien worlds. It won’t be for everyone, but there’s a bold integrity to this outlier of a novel that will attract writers and readers interested in pushing the limits of genre.\\n Vincent & Sien\\nSilvia Kwon, Macmillan, $34.99 \\n More has been unearthed over the past few years about the biography of Sien Hoornik, Vincent van Gogh’s only live-in lover, but many details remain sketchy and a novelistic treatment has plenty of gaps for the imagination to fill. Silvia Kwon takes us to The Hague in 1882, where the struggling artist first takes in Sien and her young daughter on a bitterly cold winter’s night. They will live together for 18 months, Vincent entranced by her strength of personality and the hardships endured in her former life as a sex worker. Sien takes on the role of model and muse – to survive, though she is convinced she will die by her own hand – but as the connection between the couple deepens, they face intense hostility from Vincent’s immediate family. Novels portraying artists and muses, especially those paying attention to the woman’s perspective, are almost a subgenre in themselves, and this one should appeal to art lovers curious for insight into a formative relationship involving a famously tormented artistic genius.\\n God Forgets About the Poor\\nPeter Polites, Ultimo Press, $34.99\\n A tender novel about a migrant mother, God Forgets About the Poor starts winningly in the imperative mood … as if the writer’s mother were bossing him about, offering unsolicited advice and anecdotes about why and how her story should be told. The tale stretches from poverty and civil war – hardships difficult for the mother’s descendants in Australia to imagine – in a remote mountain village on a Greek island. The contrast with 21st century Sydney couldn’t be starker. Villagers confront death as an inescapable reality: they’re bound together by the struggle to survive, the beauty of the landscape, intensity of religious feeling. This imagined Greek village is draped not in nostalgia but a vibrant earthiness, a dignity in the face of conditions that were anything but dignified. Peter Polites is also sensitive to the ways in which migrant stories can be reduced, stereotyped and consumed in mainstream publishing, and is at pains to give voice to the complexity and richness of his subject’s experience.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nMy Mother, The Spy\\nCindy Dobbin & Freda Marnie Nicholls, Allen & Unwin, $34.99\\n Mercia Masson, journalist and spy, mother of Cindy Dobbin, started working for naval intelligence in 1943 and was later recruited by ASIO to report on the Communist Party and suspected spy rings. But her daughter knew virtually nothing about Mercia’s double life (and she emerges as a cold and distant mother) until after she died. Mind you, Masson had been exposed in 1955 by the Petrov Royal Commission, because of which she claimed to have “lost everything”. For the most part, though, this is a realistic portrait of the humdrum activities of most spy work, all written in the third person from the point of view of the daughter trying to discover who her mother was. Among other things, it asks the question if the clandestine life of operatives is imposed on them by the secrecy of their work, or whether certain types are drawn to it.\\n Your Name Is Not Anxious\\nStephanie Dowrick, Allen & Unwin, $29.99\\n Frederick Nietzsche famously called his chronic pain “dog”, attempting to control it as you would a pet. Stephanie Dowrick, writer and psychotherapist, addressing the reader – in particular anyone suffering anxiety – directly as “you”, makes a similar point. “You” are in control and this, basically, is a handbook for self-therapy. Chronic anxiety “colonises” the sufferer, making them feel powerless. The task is to “de-colonise” yourself and put anxiety in its place through self-therapy (not ruling out consultative therapy). At the core of this is getting in contact with the total of your being, physical, intellectual and spiritual, contextualising anxiety and, among other things, being kind to yourself. Using case studies and personal history she expertly guides the reader through complex material, making perfect sense.\\n Shake Some Action\\nStuart Coupe, Penguin, $35\\n\\nNot many people can claim to have saved Richard Ford’s life, but Stuart Coupe can, after the American writer looked the wrong way before crossing the street and was hauled back by Coupe, supposedly in the nick of time. This book is mainly a catalogue of encounters, largely as music writer and manager, in the rock business. And it’s an impressive catalogue, from the spectacular (hanging out backstage with Bruce Springsteen in Paris, not to mention Mick Jagger), to the seedy (observing roadies selecting female fans in the ’70s for an unnamed band’s pleasure). It’s also, to some extent, an incidental retrieval of how journalism has changed over the decades – Coupe recounting his experience of taking copy into the newspaper office and handing it to the editor. Woven into this is his Launceston childhood and the origins of his passion for music writing.\\n The World of Sugar\\nUlbe Bosma, Belknap Press, $63.95\\n\\nOnce, like salt and pepper, the granules extracted from cane known as “white gold” were a luxury only the richest could savour. But from the middle ages a massive industry evolved, to the extent that today the average European consumes 40 kilos of sugar a year (60 in the US). It is an industry with a seriously dark past and a menacing present in terms of world health, WHO declaring sugar-driven obesity a pandemic in 1999. Ulbe Bosma’s history of sugar is also a case study of global capitalism over the centuries, colonial wars, and the deadly slave trade that made the industry possible. It may be a history of a sweet substance, but it has a bitter aftertaste. Like most studies that tell us how rubber, salt and paper changed the world, it’s formulaic. But it’s an interesting account of how sugar seeped into the global digestive system.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'description': 'Spoiler Alert ★★★½\\nM, 112 minutes\\n The title of Michael Ausiello’s bestselling memoir, Spoiler Alert: The Hero Dies, mixes irony and bravado in equal measure.\\n Ausiello says his book isn’t a “misery memoir”. Even though the plot hinges on a diagnosis of terminal cancer, fun and romance have equally important parts to play.\\n Michael Showalter’s film of the book drops the spoiler from the title, but we learn the worst in the opening scene. Then we’re into a flashback recounting what is essentially a love story. It begins in 2001 when Ausiello (Jim Parsons) and Kit Cowan (British actor Ben Aldridge) meet at a Manhattan club.\\n They’re an unlikely pair. Kit is a buff, charming photographer who has always preferred casual sex to steady relationships, and Michael (Jim Parsons) is a nerdy vegetarian who drinks Diet Coke and wears button-down shirts buttoned up. He’s an entertainment journalist with a special interest in sitcoms and soaps. And that’s not all. When Kit is finally permitted to visit his apartment, he finds that it’s been colonised by the Smurf collection Ausiello has been acquiring since childhood.\\n Ausiello wrote the book after Kit’s death. It grew from a series of Facebook posts read by the couple’s family and friends, one of whom was an editor at Simon & Schuster. And Showalter has succeeded in catching its spirit – its intimacy, its self-deprecating sense of humour and Ausiello’s habit of seeing life through the prism of the television shows he loved as a kid. Both his parents died when he was young and the shows take him back to the times when he was at his happiest. So, too, does the Smurf collection.\\n Kit’s parents are very much alive. His mother, Marilyn (Sally Field) competes in triathlons – despite her stately pace and dodgy knees – and his father, Bob (Bill Irwin) is kept busy carrying out his wife’s orders. Kit’s relationship with Michael finally gives him the courage to tell them that he’s gay and they do better than approve. They embrace Michael as a surrogate son.\\n The film is episodic in shape. The couple go through many ups and downs during the 13 years they spend together and the script canvasses them all. Sometimes the tone is a little too cute but Showalter (The Eyes of Tammy Faye) and his writers have a persuasive ability to defuse the looming threat of sentimentality with comedy.\\n Aldridge is terrific as the easy-going Kit, who’s been blessed with such physical confidence that the disease comes as both shock and betrayal, and Field knows exactly when to rein in the indomitable Marilyn. It’s a disarming film.\\n Spoiler Alert is in cinemas from February 9.\\n A cultural guide to going out and loving your city. Sign up to our Culture Fix newsletter here.\\n'},\n",

       "  'description': 'Jeff Tweedy was bruised and shaken after taking a 15-metre fall down the side of a cliff. When he looked up, comedian Nick Offerman and author George Saunders were looking down at him with concern on their faces.\\n No, this wasn’t a dream. This actually happened four years ago on a five-day hike in Glacier National Park in Montana, when the Wilco frontman slipped on melting ice.\\n Yes, Tweedy is “pals”, as he puts it, with the star of Parks And Recreation and the Booker Prize-winning writer.\\n “I met Nick when I appeared on Parks And Rec,” says Tweedy, reclining on a couch in his basement in Chicago after a day of rehearsals with Wilco for their upcoming world tour, a cat-shaped pillow behind his head and a collection of his late father’s electronic gadgets lining the shelves.\\n “Apparently the conversation in the writers’ room went something like, ‘We need to find an ageing, washed-up rock star.’ And someone else said, ‘someone like Jeff Tweedy?’ And someone else said, ′Well, why don’t we just ask Jeff Tweedy?’”\\n Offerman interviewed Tweedy and Saunders separately for his book Gumption, about 21 Americans who had shaped his world. Tweedy met Saunders when the two appeared on the final episode of The Colbert Report, along with a rollcall of over 100 guests that included Cookie Monster, Willie Nelson, Cyndi Lauper, George Lucas and Henry Kissinger.\\n “George is one of my favourite authors, so I went searching for him backstage,” recalls Tweedy. “I saw him come out of the door of one of the dressing rooms and I said, ‘You’re the person I’m most excited to meet here.’ And he said, ‘Well, I was just coming to find you.’ It was very romantic.”\\n Saunders told Tweedy he had listened to the sprawling Wilco song One Sunday Morning (Song For Jane Smiley’s Boyfriend) over and over every day while writing some of the stories in his collection Tenth Of December.\\n He went on to write a piece about the song for The New York Times Magazine in 2016, calling it “a reliable 12-minute prayer” and calling Tweedy “one of the great conversational poets of our time.”\\n It wasn’t long before “a three-way bromance” (Offerman’s words in an interview with Stephen Colbert) was instigated, starting with long text threads between the trio, and culminating in the hike, which made its way into Offerman’s latest book, Where The Deer And The Antelope Play.\\n Tweedy himself is also on a roll in the book-writing department. He has already published two – the 2018 memoir Let’s Go (So We Can Get Back) and 2020’s How To Write One Song.\\n The latter is a revealing and generous book about the creative process and why he thinks everyone should do it. He writes about pushing your ego out of the way and creating for the sake of creativity, and the feeling of disappearing when you’re truly in the moment.\\n I point out that people also use drugs to disappear. Tweedy, 56, used to be addicted to prescription opiates he took for crippling migraines. How did things change for him creatively when he got sober 19 years ago?\\n “It would be more accurate to say that I created those older songs in spite of being an addict,” he says. “Those issues I had were a distraction and sapped my energy, but the part of myself I was writing from was the part that was there before I did drugs. It was the part of me that was childlike and wanted a song to sing. That was the big revelation for me when I got sober. And that’s why I can still sing those songs and not feel like they were written by a different person.“\\n Wilco are a self-sufficient band with their own studio, The Loft. But for the latest Wilco album, Cousin, they invited Welsh singer-songwriter Cate Le Bon to produce.\\n “I met Cate when she played Solid Sound (the Massachusetts festival Tweedy curates) in 2019,” he says. “We performed an Arthur Russell song and Strangers by The Kinks together and hit it off right away. Then whenever Cate and her band came through Chicago on tour they would either stay at The Loft or use it for rehearsals. She just became part of the family.\\n “And when I heard her version of the Wilco song Company In My Back, which she recorded at The Loft for a cover-mount CD for Mojo magazine, it blew me away because it was such an imaginative arrangement and a unique sound. So I thought I’d ask her to produce us.“\\n A couple of the new songs are among the most politically pointed Tweedy has penned. Ten Dead came from a news story he saw on TV about yet another US school shooting.\\n “The reporter literally said ‘only 10 dead’,” says Tweedy, slowly shaking his head. “He almost had this tone of disappointment that it wasn’t a bigger news story. Or maybe he was saying ‘Well, it’s good that it was only ten.’ Either way, it was an appalling thing to say.\\n “And look, I know we hear people singing songs about things like this and go, ‘Oh yeah, the world was really waiting for you to weigh in on this. Thank you for appropriating someone else’s trauma.’ But I was trying to highlight the insanity of this becoming so matter-of-fact. The rational response to this is ‘No, this can’t happen anymore.’ It’s painfully obvious what we should do about it. Instead, we hear people talking about giving kids bulletproof backpacks.”\\n The title track is close to home, aimed at relatives who expressed far-right views after Donald Trump came to power.\\n “It’s really more about my dad than me. Before he died (in 2017) he saw family members turn their backs on democracy and decency. They felt emboldened to express their bigotry. It was something that deeply upset my father. He wasn’t a liberal by any means. He grew up in southern Illinois and he worked on the railroad. But he was decent and smart and thought Trump was what he called ‘a boss’s son’. And, in his mind, there was nothing worse than that.“\\n Tweedy has a third book due out in November. The World Within A Song will be his deep dive into 50 songs by other artists. Despite the fact he had already written a memoir, he found this book ended up being even more autobiographical, “because songs become part of our own biography, they work their way into our memories and self-image.”\\n Many of Tweedy’s choices will be unsurprising to those who follow his work: Mavis Staples, The Replacements, Dolly Parton, the Velvet Underground. But a couple may put the cat among Wilco’s “dad rock” contingent – and perhaps educate them.\\n “I chose I Love You by Billie Eilish, because, like a lot of her songs, it has this majestic, sublime melody. I think she and her brother would have been successful songwriters and performers in any era. Her songs are like jazz or torch songs, but she’s extremely modern.\\n “And I chose a song by Rosalia because I think she may be the greatest artist walking the earth right now. She has this incredible gift and she made this quantum leap from studying flamenco as a young girl to basically reinventing reggaeton music. It’s like she’s Miles Davis or Pablo Picasso. She had to be in the book.”\\n Cousin is out now. Wilco play The Forum in Melbourne on March 16, 17 and 18; the Sydney Opera House on March 22 and the Enmore Theatre on November 22.\\n'},\n",

       "  'description': 'FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nGreen Dot\\nMadeleine Gray, Allen & Unwin, $32.99\\n This Gen Z novel has all the trappings of a Bridget Jones-style romcom though its young heroine is cleverer, more cynical, and more hopelessly trapped, not only by the apparent unreachability of anything like a stable income, but by the anxieties and rationalisations underneath all the sass. Hera Stephen has reached her mid-twenties and rather enjoys her job, despite being miserably paid, as a comment moderator in a Sydney newsroom. She falls for a nerdy, older married colleague, Arthur. Like everyone else in her life, Hera has seen that story before – how could she not have? – but goes for it anyway. Madeleine Gray’s Green Dot stands out from a pack of “hot mess” novels for its wit and sensitivity, the singularity of the voice, the way it resists cliché. Some readers will be frustrated by Hera, who seems besotted by failure as much as the “ordinary happiness” Arthur appears to represent, but as she navigates questions of success, adulthood, and love itself, it’s hard not to admire her.\\n\\n\\n The Last Devil to Die\\nRichard Osman, Viking, $34.99\\n The popular Thursday Murder Club series continues in this fourth book. If you’re unfamiliar, it features a group of elderly amateur sleuths solving crimes from what proves to be the most lethal retirement village in the land.\\n Former spook Elizabeth Best, union man Ron Ritchie, nurse Joyce Meadowcroft, and psychiatrist Ibrahim Arif are at it again. In The Last Devil to Die, a character who assisted them in a previous investigation is found murdered, and a heroin shipment has vanished into thin air. The gang has a wealth of experience between them, and are accustomed to leveraging the fact that codgers and little old ladies tend to be underestimated or ignored. The team must find the killer as the body count rises, even as one member faces their own rapid decline. Newcomers should start at the beginning, and fans will be pleased to know the author has promised to complete another instalment.\\n The Love Contract\\nSteph Vizard, HarperCollins, $22.99\\n Steph Vizard’s The Love Contract nimbly stitches the tropes of romantic fiction onto the modern crisis in childcare. After her long-term relationship breaks down, Zoe decides to go it alone as a single mum. Crunch-time comes when she must return to work but can’t find anyone to mind little Hazel. Enter her neighbour and nemesis, Will – an arrogant lawyer whose boss mistakes Zoe for Will’s wife and insists that he take parental leave. The situation might solve all their problems, assuming Zoe and Will can put down their swords long enough to fake a romantic relationship, and Will cares for the tot while Zoe’s at work, of course. True to form, they draw up a contract. What seems cut and dry on paper runs into love’s fine print: there’s only so long you fake it till you make it. Vizard is clearly a Janeite, and though her novel can’t match the wit or observation of Austen, it adapts the timeless perversities of the human heart into a contemporary context, in a finely constructed narrative that readers will breeze through.\\n Light Over Liskeard\\nLouis de Bernières, Harvill Secker, $34.99\\n My prize for the year’s most irritating dystopia goes to Louis de Bernières’ Light Over Liskeard. The author of Captain Corelli’s Mandolin is no stranger to eccentric dead ends – Red Dog consisted of silly short tales about an Australian kelpie, for instance – but this confection seems such a half-hearted blob of misanthropic whimsy it’s a wonder he finished it at all. Arthur, or “Q”, is a middle-aged quantum cryptographer warned of an imminent technological crisis. He retreats to rural Cornwall where he converts a rundown farmhouse into an elaborate bunker to survive the coming apocalypse. Quirky characters bustle through the moors, among them an Edwardian schoolgirl’s ghost, a survivalist Scot, the rugged park ranger Theo, and his daughter Eva, an artist who runs everywhere and somehow develops an interest in Q the reader struggles to share. If the author intended to extol simple country life over a technological hellscape, he fails. Glimpses of the city (an indolent populace titillated by sexbots, tormented by fully automated restaurants) are more fun, with genuine satiric potential.\\n NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\\nMy Father’s Shadow\\nSandra Goldbloom Zurbo, Monash University Publishing, $32.99\\n Sandra Goldbloom Zurbo’s evocative, often moving study of her complex relationship with her father is as much a homage as a memoir. Samuel Goldbloom was a Jewish, Moscow-line communist whose politics touched every part of domestic life when she was growing up in Melbourne.\\n “Everything is political,” Samuel lectured at dinners. She admired him (treated the line as gospel, and travelled overseas with him for political events), and rebelled against him. He could be supporting and loving, but there were also “wollopings” for transgressions and sarcastic putdowns. He cast a long shadow, but she discovers a kind of resolution in his death and its wake, finding solace in knowing that through it all they loved each other.\\n Alan Joyce & Qantas\\nPeter Harbison, with Derek Sadubin, Penguin, $36.99\\n There has been no more spectacular fall from corporate grace in recent years than that of Qantas, from beloved national icon to trashed brand. And it was Alan Joyce in the pilot seat. This mix of biography and career assessment is an attempt to contextualise Joyce’s time in charge, Peter Harbison pointing out that the first part of this century was either disastrous or seriously testing for airlines worldwide (Air New Zealand went bust and the state had to acquire it), and concludes that “in seeking to make the airline bulletproof, Joyce surely couldn’t have done much better”. Scandal, inquest, sackings and severe customer backlash notwithstanding, he is optimistic that “Qantas’s reputation will recover faster than most would expect”. Others might suggest that pigs, as well as kangaroos, might fly too.\\n Abortion Care is Health Care\\nBarbara Baird, MUP, $40\\n “It is estimated,” says Barbara Baird, “that between one in three and one in four Australian women will have an abortion during their lifetime.” Baird does not address the moral dimension of the abortion issue, which has long been decided, the majority of Australians being “pro-choice”. The main question her book addresses is why there is a lag between public opinion and public health in providing abortion care, abortions – emblematic of what she calls “neoliberal abortion” – being provided “predominantly” by the private sector, at cost to the patient, and favours urban dwellers rather than those in rural and remote communities. She incorporates interviews and case studies (one, a Cairns woman arrested in 2009 for taking abortion medication), and while there is some unnecessary jargon it is accessibly written.\\n Our Fragile Moment\\nMichael Mann, Scribe, $35\\n It is ironic, says Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann, that it was climate change (the impact of a massive asteroid 65 million years ago) that made humanity and our Goldilocks Earth possible – and it’s climate change that may well imperil it.\\n In this combination of science and history, he says the past can help us understand the current challenge. He cites case studies such as the collapse of the Akkadian Empire because of severe drought, but also cautions that we need to embrace “scientific uncertainty” and that answers to climate-change questions aren’t always “cut and dried”. In this sense, he seeks to occupy a middle ground between two extremes – denialism (aided by the conservative media, especially News Corp) and doomism – in addressing the reality of climate change. Mann can qualify his arguments a bit much, but this is timely.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. Get it delivered every Friday.\\n'},\n",

But news is a messy business and today was one of those messy days full of unpredictability.\\n In fact, all week the news cycle has been full of unpredictability, a far cry from the set pieces I discussed with you last week.\\n There have been plenty of big stories that have dropped out of nowhere, forcing the newsroom to scramble into a state of coordinated chaos. These stories are otherwise known by the most overused moniker in media: “breaking news”.\\n Often such stories involve an unexpected tragedy, such as the Exford school bus crash. The freak nature of this event and its impact on the children involved, and their families, is enormously upsetting and while challenging to report on, the public interest in such incidents is obvious. Without the the Exford school bus crash and the the Exford school bus crash who put themselves at risk to rescue children trapped on the bus, the situation could have been worse. We should also be thankful for people like Warwick Teague and Joanne Grindlay and their trauma and emergency teams that responded to the seriously injured children. the Exford school bus crash gives a rare insight into how the medical teams handled the incident at the Royal Children’s Hospital.\\n While all of our journalists are expected to respond to fast-moving events with speed and accuracy, we have a team of breaking news reporters, bloggers and digital producers who are our first responders in these situations. They are trained to move quickly, with accuracy, to update you on developments via our digital platforms. The skill of these journalists is such that they can verify, produce and distribute a story to you in the time it takes a hygienic person to clean their teeth.\\n Some of these names you will know. Caroline Schelle is our morning blogger and uses her shrewd judgement to turn the relentless stream of national news into Caroline Schelle with skill, speed and accuracy. Our breaking reporters, such as the talented Caroline Schelle, will hit the phones to verify news tips or be dispatched to the scene to file “colour” to add texture to a story.\\n They are ably supported by a host of people whose names you probably don’t know. Our news director, Katie Bice, sets the priorities and identifies the right journalist for the job. Our digital editor, Daniella Miletic coordinates the production and delivery of stories online, finessing headlines and selecting the right images, with the help of our excellent digital production team. Homepage, newsletter and social media editors then set about making sure that story is delivered to you.\\n Sometimes, this happens in seconds. Yesterday, chief football writer Jake Niall called me with a big story, confirming that Alastair Clarkson had stepped away from his coaching role at North Melbourne to look after his wellbeing. Minutes later, for many of you, the first version of that story arrived in your pocket with a buzz or a ding.\\n Even now, as I write this, another resignation has taken many by surprise. Host of the ABC’s Q+A program and veteran broadcaster Stan Grant has just stepped down from his role, citing racist abuse amid complaints about the public broadcaster’s coverage of the coronation of King Charles. A discussion between relevant editors is flowing in the newsroom, considering how to cover the story and whose insights might be most valuable to our readers. We didn’t see this one coming, but we’re doing our best to bring you the news quickly, with nuance and thoughtfulness.\\n Journalists are superstitious people. Simply uttering phrases like “slow news day” or “it’s really quiet” can conjure up any manner of disasters, according to newsroom mythology. In spite of this faux fear, the buzz of a room full of journalists working as a pack in pursuit of a developing story can be an awesome thing to behold. Contrary to one of the more negative perceptions that exist about our industry, The Age’s reporters invariably do so with sensitivity, respect and caution, keeping the public interest at the heart of every question.\\n Speed is certainly not everything. Accuracy is prized above all else in our newsroom. We don’t always do things perfectly in fast-moving situations, but we aim to. I couldn’t think of a team better equipped for that task than the “breaking desk” at The Age.\\n That brings me to my final point about the inherent messiness of news, the one that will really make you think and change your perspective …\\n Wait, sorry, another story.

       "  'headline': 'Awkward and cringy – Post Malone performs at Melbourne Showgrounds',\n",
       "  'description': 'MUSIC\\nPost Malone ★\\nMelbourne Showgrounds, November 30\\n Red fireworks burst into the sky like flares at sea, as rain showers down on a sold-out crowd waiting to see American rapper Post Malone.\\n A group of fans are rejected from the golden circle, the central pit in front of the stage. They complain as they’re ushered behind a tree roughly a hundred metres from the area they’d purchased tickets for.\\n The same happens to another group, who show me their tickets but have also been issued the wrong wristband. Another group returns from the ticket booth, having complained about their tickets. They say they are told there are no more golden circle wristbands so they’re relegated to general admission. These fans paid hundreds of dollars. They’ve travelled for hours to be here.\\n A Live Nation spokeswoman on Friday denied golden circle tickets were oversold. “We had ample wristbands printed for the golden circle sales, and no issues were reported last night to the event control centre, event or site offices during the show.”\\n One of the rejected fans resists the solemn mood of his friendship group, sculling a can of beer before breaking out in a wild dance. It’s raining heavily now. The group watches the lone dancer for a moment before seeking shelter beneath the merch stands.\\n “Post Malone”, members of the crowd tell me, “is a sad character or an antihero or both.” I’m told he is an introvert, an outsider, an outcast – as if that hasn’t been the story of every rapper since the inception of hip-hop. “He’s different.” they assure me.\\n The show has the veneer of hip-hop with pop, rock and R&B drippings. The genres are scattered and messy, and it feels as though Post Malone isn’t comfortable in his own tattooed skin. Maybe that’s the point. From where we stand, the rapper can only be seen on giant pixelated screens.\\n There’s a startling distraction of more fireworks as he sings unconvincingly, “I’ve been f--kin’ hoes and poppin’ pillies / Man, I feel just like a rockstar / All my brothers got that gas / And they always be smokin’ like a Rasta.” He waves around a guitar, dances awkwardly, some find it charming, and then brings The Kid Laroi on stage to perform Bleed – which becomes the only highlight of the show.\\n The music feels like indie pop’s answer to hip-hop. I wonder if this is what the whitewashing of hip-hop culture sounds like? It’s clear, the audience can relate to his broken personality in a way I can’t.\\n In what’s meant to be a moment of catharsis, Post Malone asks a fan to join him on stage for a shoey. The shoey has become something of a motif in his shows.\\n Pouring beer into a shoe and drinking it has become a strange ritual that visiting artists are often forced into in their Australian shows.\\n It is also a stunt synonymous with First Nations UFC fighter Bam Bam Tuivasa (dubbed “shoeyvasa”), who brawls against the odds, crawling out of cage fights with blood splattered across his face before raising a Nike TN full of liquor, a Western Sydney-style toast, before throwing the sweaty drink down the hatch. It’s something of a counter-culture coronation.\\n Post Malone’s shoey isn’t anything like that. I’ve seen more gravitas in toasts of VB at the local cricket club.\\n And if it’s an attempt to connect with Australian culture, it feels about as cringy as opening a hip-hop show with Angus Stone. Angus Stone was the opening act.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. Get it every Friday.\\n'},\n",

       "  'headline': 'He played Harry Potter on stage. Now he’s out of work, and nearly out of money',\n",
       "  'description': 'Gareth Reeves played one of the most high-profile theatre roles in the world, but he has found himself back in a position depressingly familiar to all actors: the money is about to run out and there is no work on the horizon.\\n For over a thousand shows starting back in February 2019 Reeves played Harry Potter in the blockbuster Melbourne production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\\n Cursed Child closed just under two weeks ago, after several lockdowns and selling over a million tickets, but it will take some time for Reeves’ body to unlearn the muscle memory it has created. “I woke up in the middle of the night two nights ago doing the show, apparently,” he says.\\n Playing the one role for so long is highly unusual and Reeves knew this from the outset.\\n “[Normally] you do your three to six weeks season – or longer if you’re doing a tour – and then crash and get the flu and fall apart and then get up and madly scramble around for the next gig,” he explains. “My whole life [as an actor] I’ve always kind of hovered around this sort of $20-$30,000 a year kind of income.”\\n So, when he was cast as Harry Potter he knew it was a chance that might not come again. “Going into it one of my first thoughts was ‘OK, this might be the only time in my life I have a full-time job’,” he says.“So, we were like, OK, we have to be smart about this. How can we maximise the opportunity?”\\n Reeves took out a home loan and built the kind of financial buffer that is rarely possible for actors. In two months, however, that buffer will run out and he will return to familiar territory – trying to pay the bills any way he can and not knowing what acting job comes next.\\n “I’m looking at training as a marriage celebrant and helping out a friend who’s setting up a small business,” he says. “That’s about all I’ve got in the pipeline at the moment.” \\n While Reeves threw himself into playing Harry Potter and found the experience deeply satisfying, he also knew that when things finished he would be returning to the hustle that goes hand in hand with being an actor.\\n “In terms of career ... I’m under no illusions that playing Harry Potter is going to open any doors for me. I think, if anything while I’ve been doing this, a bunch of doors have probably closed and I have to go back and start banging on them again.”\\n He says it’s an interesting time to find himself out of work, pointing to the Hollywood writers and actors strike. “We’re all watching very closely,” he says.\\n Something the strike has put into sharp relief is that a big break doesn’t necessarily mean financial security, or an increased likelihood of work in the future. More often than not, once that role wraps up, you’re back where you started.\\n “It took me years, even as an actor to figure that out” says Reeves. “I had friends who would get a big gig and you were like, ‘Well, off they go they’re loaded now’. But that isn’t the reality, at least not any more.”\\n He points to streaming services in particular – even if actors land a role in something high profile and well regarded, “it’s only once it becomes popular and starts repeating that you and your team can then start to kind of push and negotiate for a bit more”.\\n “No one’s set for life anymore, that’s for sure.”\\n “As you get older, and you have families or you get a gig that enables you to buy a house … this is one of the main times that people start dropping off,” says Reeves. “They just get jack of it and start to see the advantages of having a job where you can be home at night with your families and be around on the weekends to see people, and to be able to know that that money is coming in regularly and know how much it’s going be.\\n “Harry was a real outlier – it was a large Broadway-musical-scale play with movement, and there aren’t many of those. I always knew that it was going to be a one off.\\n “I’ve got this little window of time just to breathe and heal and find out who I am now [while] trying to stave off the terror because I have absolutely no work or gigs lined up at all, not through lack of trying – but I’m working on it,” he says with a small laugh.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'headline': 'Eye-catching debut for the futuristic festival aiming to transform the city',\n",
       "  'description': 'Over the past three weekends, Melbourne’s major new arts festival Now or Never made its dizzying debut. With a focus on the future of technology, it sits in a crowded field of high-concept, brand-intensive, publicly funded festivals including RISING, Vivid and Dark Mofo (which is privately owned but receives public funds). So, where does it land?\\n Now or Never is a consolidation of Melbourne Music Week and Melbourne Knowledge Week and continues MMW’s tradition of reinvigorating under-utilised civic spaces. For its marquee venue, Now or Never staged major contemporary music performances in the Royal Exhibition Building for the first time in more than 20 years.\\n Inside, a dazzling, 16-metre-high semi-transparent LED screen (inspired by a similar, social media famous installation in the London super-club Printworks) was the backdrop for highlights including Orchestra Victoria’s hypnotic rendition of minimalist composer Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians; anarchic modular techno by the Bristol duo Giant Swan; and a community-affirming celebration of Queer artistry headlined by the pre-eminent experimental US R&B artist, Kelela. Concerns around the building’s hard, reflective surfaces proved unwarranted – the room sounds fantastic.\\n Now or Never’s series of talks from scientists, artists and designers underpinned its performances. In a keynote speech, the London-based social entrepreneur and architect, Indy Johar, proposed a complete reorganisation of governance, the economy and our relationship to the land we live on to ensure humanity’s survival. If we do as Johar says, how should a city’s publicly funded festivals reflect that change? What’s their purpose, and who should they serve?\\n RISING opted to empower artists with its bold programming and initially chose a smaller number of thematically more complex free public artworks than White Night, the increasingly unmanageable festival it replaced. But arguably, RISING alienated the broad audience White Night amassed in the process. Now or Never took note and presented a free 1.2-kilometre Docklands Art Trail; a thematically accessible 360-degree full-dome cinema presentation in its Neversphere; and SACRA – an epic, RISING alienated the broad audience White Night amassed in the process.\\n Now or Never’s NONSTOP WKND (formerly MMW’s Live Music Safari) was a crucial social leveller. Affordable day passes (reduced in price at the eleventh hour) gave audiences access to 70 artists performing at 13 shows, in six Melbourne venues. In shadowy rooms vibrating with bass, attendees let loose without hyper-specialised knowledge of a medium’s in-jokes or conventions.\\n Walking into one of the city’s beloved band rooms one could find singer Georgie Darvidis belting out John Farnham’s You’re the Voice in the style of Björk; the performance artist Mara Gallagher, spotlit on a milk crate podium being buffeted by leaf blowers; the DJ Adriana supporting Pontic Greek folk dancers; and the Honduran DJ Low Jack upending a club with Britney Spears edits and Central American dance genres, including electro Latino and zouk bass.\\n Now or Never’s opening party at Max Watts featured exclusively First Peoples DJs, and the festival opened its events with a message supporting the Voice to parliament. But those overtures ring hollow when First Peoples performers are only given opening, interstitial or back-up slots at the festival’s flagship Royal Exhibition Building venue; just two First Peoples artists in its Docklands Art Trail; and one film in the Neversphere.\\n As confirmed to The Age by the festival, NONSTOP WKND included international and local performers with Nigerian, Serbian, Indonesian, Japanese, Colombian, Chilean, Hong Kong, Angolan, Black American and Mauritian heritages – but none of the 70 acts at NONSTOP WKND were from First Peoples communities.\\n The festival included some First Peoples representation in smaller events and talks, but the absence was felt at Now or Never’s mass-attendance program pieces. Representation matters in what context it happens as well as how often.\\n In a flicker of hope, Now or Never has already presented a template to help it fix the imbalance in subsequent years at Never Permanent, its day-long conference co-presented with Semi-Permanent. The day’s sole First Peoples speaker (the speakers in general came from a wide range of backgrounds), the AI researcher, designer and entrepreneur Professor Angie Abdilla, a Palawa woman, presented her Country-centred Design philosophy.\\n Abdilla’s concept places care for Country and community at the heart of decision-making: When it comes to the consultation process, who is asking the questions? Is the work interrupting an important cultural practice or enhancing it? Does the work holistically benefit the community in which it’s taking place? Many of these concepts sync with Johar’s thoughts, too.\\n Now or Never’s futurist thematic undertaking is both a challenge and opportunity. The City of Melbourne, the festival and its directors are on the cusp of creating something extraordinary that caters to academics and aesthetes, while engaging and challenging a broad audience, too – but only if it practises what it preaches year-on-year. If Now or Never can look to the future, while meaningfully incorporating the practical knowledge systems that have existed here for tens of thousands of years, it will have something truly unique within its grasp.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'headline': 'Judith Lucy takes on one of the most demanding roles in modern theatre',\n",
       "  'description': 'THEATRE\\nHappy Days ★★★½\\nSamuel Beckett, Melbourne Theatre Company, until June 10\\n For decades, Judith Lucy has cultivated the curled lip and sardonic wit of the jaded urbanite, perfecting the art of acidic feminist snark. Her comedy is, above all, knowing. Winnie in Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days is a very different creature. There’s a lot to unknow to fully realise one of the most demanding parts in modern drama.\\n Winnie is in deep shit. Sand, actually – first up to her waist, then her neck – on a hellishly hot day in a vast desert landscape, after some unnamed apocalypse. (To a contemporary audience, climate change presents itself as the inescapable suggestion.)\\n She has only her faceless husband Willie (Hayden Spencer) for company, and he mostly ignores her.\\n Such a hopeless situation would make most of us want to curl up and die – or at least bitterly complain. Not Winnie. She ignores the gun within arm’s reach and gets on with her day. Puts on lippy. Brushes her teeth. Files her nails. She prattles. Gives herself little pep talks. Makes one-sided stabs at conversation with Willie. Half-remembers fragments of the Psalms and Shakespeare. Counts blessings and mercies.\\n Winnie’s radical optimism scales the cliff of the present by using that exotic grammatical tense, the future perfect. “This will have been,” she repeats after any memorable event in her existence, “a happy day”.\\n Audiences may find themselves admiring Lucy’s tenacity, barracking for the underdog, and relishing some inspired passages of play in this unconventional interpretation. But accomplished histrionic technique? Command of the musicality of the language? A breath-catching, effortlessly inhabited Winnie whose unyielding, half-ingenuous act of self-assertion at once doggedly resists and helplessly succumbs to distinctly feminine forms of self-erasure? No, not really.\\n What we get isn’t exactly unimpressive.\\n Despite the plastered smile, Winnie is channelled in part through Lucy’s irrepressible comic persona. It’s a deliberately spiky performance with a much stronger passive-aggressive streak than the role usually receives, and can be funnier for that, especially in the low-key marital stand-off with Willie, and in meta-theatrical moments.\\n Lucy’s elastic and expressive face, aided by shadowy lighting design, also makes her neck-up performance a tormented battleground against evanescence – achieving if not outright poignancy, then at least a strangely familiar desolation, punctuated by sharp notes of suppressed anger.\\n Whether Winnie can rage against the dying of the light in quite this way without compromising the aching fragility behind her resilience, I’m not sure.\\n And maybe director Petra Kalive could have risked cracking this classic wide open to contemporary feminist challenge, by striking a consistent, and entirely self-conscious, anachronistic tone.\\n Given the scale of the task faced here, this is a valiant performance, unconstrained by tradition, that brings fresh insights to the work a play every theatre lover should want to see.\\n It’s obvious Judith Lucy has the talent and creative intelligence for a stage acting career, and if Joanna Murray-Smith wrote a play for her, I’d see it in a heartbeat.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'headline': 'One man and his dog: The lonely task of writing an opera',\n",
       "  'description': 'In a second-storey room of a Brunswick building I must have walked past dozens of times without noticing, Richard Mills is creating music.\\n Books are stacked neatly around the place, a piano stands off to one side, a desk is strewn with papers, and curled up on a chair is the accomplished composer and conductor’s dog, Buddy, who is his constant companion through the process of writing an opera from scratch.\\n Walking Buddy, who is one of the loveliest dogs you’ll ever meet, and getting a coffee are the two main breaks from writing Mills takes. The rest of the time he is immersed in the musical world he is creating.\\n “Writing music is really hard work. It takes time and concentration, and it takes isolation,” he says. “You can’t be talking to people – you’ve got to sit and do it quietly away from outside influences.”\\n When we meet, Mills is in the process of composing Galileo, a new work that will also mark his final production as artistic director of Victorian Opera after 11 years in the role. He will, however, be staying close to music. It’s impossible, he agrees, to ever retire from a vocation.\\n Though he is wrapping up his tenure, his passion for the art form is just as fiery as ever. He’s steadfast about the importance of opera and, while proud of what Victorian Opera has been contributing, feels that is a significant distance between where we are and where we should be in the art form as a state.\\n “Opera’s part of that continuum of the imagination – and a society without imagination has no future,” he says. “It happens to contain some of the greatest thoughts penned by human beings … It opens a window on the marvellous to a community … it creates opportunities to see the world in a different way.”\\n Every Victorian Opera program balances past and present, with an emphasis on spotlighting local talent both on the stage and behind the pen. “We were doing everything … this state government’s wanted to do long before they even published an arts policy, because it’s the right thing to do. I mean, we should be working with First Nations, we should be responsible to our community, we should be doing education. We should be doing accessible, meaningful work for families. We’re doing all of that – we always have. ”\\n That said, he feels there is more that could be done. “Every city that aspires to be an important centre has an opera company – and Melbourne should have a properly articulated state company at about $10 or $12 million a year. That would serve the city well, and the whole community,” says Mills.\\n At present, while Victoria has several local opera companies, there isn’t a dedicated state opera with that level of funding. Instead the role is filled in part by Victorian Opera, which was founded in 2005 and currently receives about $4.8 million in local and federal funding, and in part by Opera Australia, which formed when the Victoria State Opera merged with the Australian Opera in 1996 but is not Victoria-focused.\\n Mills also has his eye on the bigger picture beyond Victorian Opera. His views are firm and clear: pathways for young musicians and composers have become more tortuous and opaque, venues for performance are inadequate, government funding for performing arts is inadequate and spaces for emerging artists to experiment and create have all but disappeared.\\n “I feel incredibly fortunate when I was starting out as a young composer,” he says. “I’m not a great composer, I’m a good craftsman … I was lucky to be given opportunities at a time when it was much easier,” he says.\\n “The orchestras in those days were not run as businesses. They were broadcasting orchestras. So they had a lot of time to play Australian music.”\\n He has spoken before about how badly Melbourne needs its own opera house, and when asked about this – and where it should go – he doesn’t hesitate. “Fishermans Bend. It’s going to be a major hub.” He explains how a few years back he started work on a design made of shipping containers, then worked with Alan Pert from the University of Melbourne’s design school to work on a mock-up for another idea. “A 1200 seater.”\\n At present, Victorian Opera performs at the Palais and the Arts Centre. “The trouble with the Arts Centre is it would cost $250,000 a fortnight and it’s just too big. Opera needs to be on a human scale. In a resonant space, the voice sounds beautiful,” he says. “The Arts Centre, of course, is full of carpet [and] carpet’s a natural enemy of voice.”\\n The venue issue extends beyond companies like Victorian Opera needing places to perform finished work, he emphasises.\\n “There’s no sandpit in Melbourne for the younger generation, the emerging generation, to make stuff and try things,” he says.\\n “Barrie Kosky, when he first started out, made shows and put them on in garages, in service stations, but … we’ve destroyed all those old industrial spaces that the young practitioners could rent. It’s why the whole Fishermans Bend thing is incredibly important, because this city needs a sandpit – it needs a place for emerging talent to manifest itself without punitive cost structures.”\\n Mills is grateful for the time and space he had in his musical education to hone his craft, and this week his newest work, Galileo, has its concert premiere at the Palais.\\n He was drawn to the story of the Italian polymath because “it seems to me that it is a story for our time”.\\n Galileo was a pioneer in the field of astronomy whose work found him tried by the Roman Inquisition and falling out of favour with the pope. His final years were spent under house arrest.\\n Even so, Mills was repeatedly asked why Galileo – why not Giordano Bruno? “It’s much more dramatic because Bruno was burned as a heretic,” he says. But for Mills, the story that can be woven from Galileo’s life is “much more nuanced and much more dimensional”. He was drawn in by the complexity.\\n “It’s a story about the search for truth, and the meaning of truth. It’s the relation of truth and politics. It’s also a story about a spiritual quest. It’s a story about the possibility of faith. It’s a story about all of this taking place in a constantly shifting environment that was, you know, negotiating the plague. Think about it. What’s changed?”\\n Galileo, a new opera in concert, will be performed by Victorian Opera on December 20 at the Palais Theatre.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "  'headline': 'The 20 best shows to stream on Netflix right now',\n",
       "  'description': 'It’s a near-impossible task, but the finished list is worth the struggle. In compiling Netflix’s 20 essential shows, I had a few simple parameters: scripted only (no documentaries or reality fare), mix the signature hits with the lesser-known, and recognise the breadth of the streaming service’s programming. Your favourite show might not be here, then again neither is mine.\\n Beef\\n Starting with a road rage incident and escalating to vengeful pranks, this black farce about a pair of Los Angeles residents – played by Ali Wong and Steven Yeun – appears to be a barbed contemporary comedy, but scene by scene it goes deeper into the characters, their failings, and ultimately their connection. It is a masterful, arresting transformation.\\n Black Mirror\\n Charlie Brooker’s science-fiction anthology debuted 12 years ago, which means that some of the dystopian concepts he built each season’s handful of episodes around no longer feel like mordant speculation. But the best episodes – start with San Junipero – still resonate in ways both fascinating and fearful, and the show’s evolution is fascinating to trace.\\n Bodyguard\\n Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio pushed his talent for tense thrillers punctuated by whiplash reveals to the limits with this limited series about a British personal protection officer and traumatised war veteran (Richard Madden, in his finest performance) assigned to a hard-as-nails cabinet minister (Keeley Hawes). The dynamic between the two is one of many combustible elements here.\\n BoJack Horseman\\n Hollywood satires tend to be snarky and short-sighted, so naturally it took an animated series where the Los Angeles subjects are anthropomorphic animals to really twist the knife. Daft at first encounter, full of visual delights, and psychologically acute, the story of the titular equine sitcom star (perfectly voiced by Will Arnett) dug deeper across six seasons than most prestige dramas ever could.\\n Borgen\\n The definitive political drama of the 21st century, this Danish series originally aired for three seasons between 2010 and 2013, with its depiction of power – how to wield it, what it costs – gripping when intermixed with piquant characters. Netflix added a sharply drawn fourth season last year, and the show’s many telling observations remain relevant.\\n The Crown\\n The closer this historic drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II has got to the present day, the more its spell has dissipated. Nonetheless, Peter Morgan’s royal drama is one of Netflix’s signature shows and the Claire Foy and Olivia Colman eras as Her Majesty are sumptuous character studies of privilege, contradiction and immaculate insults.\\n Dark\\n Seriously, don’t be flippant with this dense German drama: you’re in for three seasons of increasingly complex narratives, as events in an orderly town are tied together through time travel patterns every 33 years. It is bleakly gripping – mournful cellos yes, humour no – as kidnapped children and temporal conspiracies abound, but its depiction of regret and inevitability is also tragically beautiful.\\n Derry Girls\\n Has there ever been a sitcom as silly and yet sublime as Lisa McGee’s ode to her 1990s high school misadventures in Northern Ireland during the final years of sectarian conflict. Historic events and being banned from the local chippy intertwine as a group of teenage girls – and their plus-one male English cousin – plot wildly and act badly. The funniest coming of age tale going.\\n The Good Place\\n A classic American network sitcom in structure – 22-minute episodes! – loaded with inventive ideas, ingenious gags and moral quandaries, the four seasons of this metaphysical comedy find a group of wayward strangers exploring the afterlife. It is in turn nutty, soulful, and stacked with note-perfect performances (take a bow, Ted Danson).\\n The Haunting of Hill House\\n Filmmaker turned showrunner Mike Flanagan is Netflix’s resident horror auteur: year after year he updates classic horror tales or modifies the genre. My pick of his limited series is the first, which matches a group of siblings’ haunted house experience as children with their experience as emotionally damaged adults. Much is terrifying here, including familial bonds.\\n Hilda\\n Gorgeously animated – words to the effect of “Hayao Miyazaki in Scandinavia” are rightfully found in many reviews – the two seasons of this children’s series follow the adventures of the titular 11-year-old (voiced by The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey). The tone can be bittersweet or chaotic, as Hilda’s outings go from the mundane to the fantastical and she begins to comprehend the wider world’s flaws.\\n I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson\\n After three seasons of this genius sketch comedy series, it’s got to the point where I laugh so uncontrollably hard that my oldest son simply calls out “Tim Robinson” from another room. Absurd but always a step ahead of your expectations, Robinson’s pieces explore the extremes of social limits.\\n Monty Python’s Flying Circus\\n Tom Robinson, and many other sketch comics, wouldn’t have a career if it wasn’t for this feted troupe of British comics. Netflix has all four seasons of their BBC show, which debuted in 1969 and paved the way for their classic film comedies, and while time and a changing society has shaded certain numbers, there is still one-of-a-kind brilliance here.\\n Mindhunter\\n When the two circles on your Venn diagram are filmmaker David Fincher and infamous serial killers of the 1970s, you’re in for an intense series. A study of detail and dread, this impeccable psychological thriller follows a pair of outlier FBI agents and a female psychology professor interviewing jailed mass murderers such as Son of Sam.\\n Never Have I Ever\\n Netflix recently wrapped up, with a satisfying mix of teenage realisation and timeless awkwardness, this coming-of-age comic-drama, as Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and her pals finished high school. Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher’s show was always funny, but it grew more perceptive about its Indian-American lead and the rigours of adolescence with each season. Bonus: an amazing celebrity narrator.\\n Seinfeld\\n The era-defining sitcoms of the 1990s are lucrative trophies in the streaming era, with Netflix currently home to all 180 episodes of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David’s celebrated comedy about a group of New Yorkers with the worst of intentions. Riffing off minor misunderstandings and friendly misdemeanours, this 20th century classic has episodes assembled with clockwork precision and hilarious send-offs.\\n Squid Game\\n The games without frontiers that punctuated this shocking and addictive drama turned Netflix’s South Korean production arm from stealth success to superstar. With a harsh undercurrent of inequality fuelling the fantastical limits, a group of strangers find themselves in an underground competition where children’s games are literally a matter of life and death.\\n Stateless\\n A funding arrangement means that Netflix ends up taking the ABC’s scripted shows to the world, while providing a valuable second chance locally.

       "  'headline': 'PwC behind 15 schemes to sidestep tax, says ATO',\n",
       "  'description': 'PwC was behind 15 schemes designed to help multinationals sidestep tax laws, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan told a parliamentary committee late on Tuesday.\\n Mr Jordan also accused PwC of frustrating its investigations into these types of schemes – which, in total, put at risk $180 million in tax revenue a year – via “false claims” of legal privilege.\\n The ATO learnt that PwC partner Peter Collins had used confidential Treasury information to develop the schemes in late 2017.\\n This was months before Mr Collins, signed the last of three confidentiality agreements to consult on the new tax laws, in February 2018 when Treasury did not know about the ATO’s discovery.\\n Second tax commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn said the ATO had the first hints in late 2017 that Mr Collins had breached confidentiality.\\n “By the start of 2019 we actually took an assistant commissioner offline…with a team of 20 or so staff were solely focused on dealing with these matters.”\\n But Mr Jordan said the ATO was prevented by outdated secrecy laws from informing the Treasurer of these developments.\\n The commissioner named three PwC clients that were involved in claims for legal privilege.\\n “The three companies… were all PwC clients that we’ve taken to the court and are public and that’s why we can mention Glencore... ABi InBev and JBS, the Brazilian meat processing [company],” Mr Jordan said.\\n In another development, Peter van Dongen, the former chairman of PwC’s board, and Paul Abbey, a tax partner at the firm, have both been removed from a website listing the firm’s governance board members, indicating they may have stepped down. The firm would not comment on the changes.\\n Earlier on Tuesday, officials from Treasury fielded a barrage of questions about their ongoing relationship with PwC, when they learned of the tax leaks and what they have done in response to the scandal. Defence officials were also grilled about the 54 contracts the department had with PwC, worth more than $223 million.\\n In his opening statement, Mr Jordan told the committee that the ATO became aware of a handful of multinationals trying to avoid the new laws in early 2016, which triggered audits.\\n “In January 2016, we became aware of a handful of multinationals suspiciously and quickly attempting to restructure their affairs upon the introduction of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL),” Mr Jordan said.\\n “Within days of becoming aware, we commenced reviews and audits of those multinationals and issued three Taxpayer Alerts in 2016, putting all significant firms and taxpayers on notice.\\n “Our immediate action prevented any loss of revenue to the Commonwealth from a scheme to avoid the MAAL. We estimate the revenue at risk was $180 million annually.”\\n AFP advice sought in 2018 Mr Jordan also detailed how the Tax Office shared information with federal police in 2018 about Mr Collins leaking confidential Treasury documents.\\n This means the decision by Treasury head Dr Steven Kennedy to refer the PwC tax leaks scandal to the AFP is the second time the police have been called in over the matter.\\n Federal Police commissioner Reece Kershaw made no reference to the earlier consultation when questioned about the PwC matter at estimates last Thursday. The federal police decided to take no further action in 2019.\\n An AFP spokesperson said that the ATO only provided “representative sample documents” for assessment.\\n “The AFP assessed, based on the material that the ATO provided, was that there was insufficient information in the material, to support a formal referral,” the spokesperson said. “In consultation and agreement with the ATO, the matter was closed in 2019.”\\n Later, in July 2020, the Tax Office formally referred the matter to Tax Practitioners Board, which investigates members of the tax profession.\\n Mr Jordan also provided a timeline that showed that the ATO obtained a cache of PwC internal emails in late 2017, which showed that Mr Collins had shared confidential Treasury documents that he received with other PwC partners, who then used the information to target new clients.\\n It’s not clear which part of the ATO first obtained the emails, but their existence appears not to have been widely known in the tax regulator.\\n As a result, Mr Collins – who signed his first confidentiality agreement with Treasury in 2013 – continued to act as an adviser to Treasury on plans for new anti avoidance laws.\\n “Unlike many revenue authorities in other countries, we do not have criminal investigative powers. As the confidentiality breach was not a tax offence, we were unable to investigate the matter further and from 2018 we sought to refer this matter to the correct authority,” Mr Jordan said.\\n ‘Circling like vultures’ Earlier in the day, Greens Senator David Shoebridge said it appeared PwC had been “circling like vultures” trying to win defence contracts. He said Defence was “far and away” PwC’s biggest government client, with contracts worth eight times more than the next nearest department.\\n The department’s associate secretary, Matt Yannopoulos, defended the volume of work that PwC had won, saying the military was undergoing a significant recapitalisation with new weapons and platforms.\\n “We are the largest project delivery organisation in the Commonwealth,” Mr Yannopoulos said. Mr Yannopoulos said PwC had twice offered written assurances that the 54 staff whose names have not been made public did not work on defence contracts.\\n On Monday, PwC acting chief executive Kristin Stubbins announced nine partners would go on leave pending further investigation, as part of a suite of measures to show the firm was taking decisive action over the tax leaks scandal. Ms Stubbins also announced that chairman Tracey Kennair and governance board risk chairman Paddy Carney had decided to step down from their roles\\n The nine partners were not named but are understood to include former executive board members Pete Calleja and Sean Gregory. The pair had earlier stepped down from their leadership roles at the firm. Separately from these nine partners, the firm has already announced former chief executive Tom Seymour will retire early from the firm in September.\\n With Andrew Tillett, Lois Maskiell and Campbell Kwan\\n'},\n",

       "  'headline': 'Who will be Australia’s first poet laureate? (And what does that actually mean?)',\n",
       "  'description': 'Australia has had only one poet laureate. That was a former convict, Michael Massey Robinson, who was appointed by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in the early 19th century to write odes for royal birthdays. He received a couple of cows from the government herd for his trouble.\\n His Ode for the Queen’s Birthday, 1814 included the immortal lines: “ILLUSTRIOUS QUEEN! exalted WIFE! / Ador’d thro’ ev’ry Stage of Life / By Nature’s Impulse taught to share / THY CONSORT’s ling’ring Hours of Care.”\\n Two centuries the position of poet laureate is set to be revived under the federal government’s new national cultural policy. In 2025 Australia will join the likes of the US, New Zealand, UK, Canada, Jamaica, Nigeria and appoint an official poet laureate.\\n But what does a poet laureate do? In Britain, the job is a royal appointment on advice from the Prime Minister and the chosen poet commemorates royal occasions as well as working on their own projects. The current poet laureate, Simon Armitage, marked the death of Queen Elizabeth II with Floral Tribute, which came shortly after he wrote Queenhood to mark her platinum jubilee: “A priceless freight for a young woman to bear / but, draped and adorned, a monarch walks forward / into the sideways weather of oncoming years.”\\n Sarah Holland-Batt is an award-winning poet and Professor of Creative Writing & Literary Studies at the Queensland University of Technology, who advocated for Australia to have a poet laureate in her submission to the national cultural policy and read her poem The Gift at the announcement of the policy in Melbourne on Monday. She says the person chosen would promote poetry generally and connect it more with the public.\\n “An Australian poet laureate would elevate the status of Australian poetry domestically and internationally ,” Holland-Batt says. “Australian literature can struggle on the world stage so there would be a soft diplomacy element to it.”\\n She said the laureate would be an advocate for Australia and Australian writing and the benefits would be beyond only poetry.\\n “It would be a big boost for Australian literature to have someone with that authority invested by the state.”\\n But she also said the office should not be too prescribed:“There should be the leeway for each poet to do what they want. There would have to be a degree of trust.”\\n Peter Rose, poet and editor of Australian Book Review, one of the country’s leading literary magazines, said Australia needed a poet laureate.\\n “Other literary cultures have had them for centuries, ” he says. “We see all the benefits in those positions. But they must have considerable freedom and budget. It’s a great opportunity to present poetry to the public in a way that may demystify it to the public.”\\n Rose said the appointment would be crucial, but doesn’t know the criteria would be for selection.\\n “I don’t think it should be a lifetime achievement award. It should be a real communicator, someone who can convey poetry to non-readers. It’s important for it to go to people with a real record and commitment to public education. Someone with a real hunger to counter the sense that poetry is too difficult, or the most elite form of literature, someone of considerable charm and eloquence.”\\n So who should it be? Holland-Batt said it should be a distinguished person, someone who has obviously published poetry but also written about poetry and engaged with the poetry of others. And significantly, someone who could respond to public events. “Occasional poems are really difficult to write,” she said.\\n Lyn McCredden, emeritus professor of creative writing and literary studies at Deakin University, said she hoped whoever is chosen was someone who could speak to people, to celebrate and be positive. “I don’t want someone who is oblique and full of misery,” she says.\\n She said there were a lot of Indigenous poets and younger poets using language in a vibrant and contemporary way. “It should be someone who has breadth and a sense of the diversity of the Australian people and a sense of the land. It is about making us proud and also correcting our blindness and speaking to new possibilities.”\\n Poets who may be up for consideration in a selection process yet to be determined include David Malouf, Ali Cobby Eckerman, Evelyn Araluen, Judith Beveridge, John Kinsella, Lachlan Brown, Adam Aitken, as well as other award winners or prolific poets.\\n The title of poet laureate dates back to classical Greece and Rome when poets were presented with a crown of laurel leaves in honour of Apollo, the god of poetry. In Britain, the position was created in 1668 with John Dryden the first royal appointment. Alfred, Lord Tennyson held the office for more than 40 years in the 19th century, but now poets serve a 10-year fixed term. Carol-Ann Duffy was the first woman in the position, with Armitage succeeding her in 2019.\\n The US created the office in 1936 and since 1986 the laureate is also the consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. The current laureate, Ada Limon, is obliged to give one lecture and read her work at the library, but is free to work on her own writing. But many US states and cities also have poets laureate, as do Canadian provinces. In Canada the laureate is obliged to write in French and English; the current holder is Louise Bernice Halfe.\\n The New Zealand position was first established in 1997, by a winery, but 10 years later the national Library took over the running. Chris Tse is the current laureate.\\n When Andrew Motion attended the Sydney Writers’ Festival in May 1999 news leaked that he was to be Britain’s new poet laureate. But what surprised Motion most was not that he had been chosen – he knew his name was up for consideration - but the interest shown in Australia. Now that interest can turn to our own poet laureate.\\n The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. Get it delivered every Friday.\\n'},\n",

       "  'headline': 'The two women shaking up the idea of what makes good theatre',\n",
       "  'description': 'When musical director, multi-instrumentalist, composer, cabaret artist and artistic director Victoria Falconer was growing up, she knew she wanted to star in a musical.\\n “Musicals seemed the appropriate place for a big show-off who loved playing lots of instruments and singing and titting around generally,” she says. “But it was very rare to see myself represented on stage.”\\n So rare that Falconer, who has Philippine and British heritage, and is co-artistic director at Sydney’s Hayes Theatre (with Richard Carroll), stopped trying to work in the world of musicals and instead jumped into cabaret and physical theatre.\\n “I lived in fringe-land,” she says. “I wanted to bring in different influences, play around with form, the kind of stuff you get from having an interesting, diverse childhood and a family of two different cultures.\\n “Musicals didn’t seem like the place for that. So I went away and lived in fringe-land, which more than welcomes that kind of work.”\\n Falconer’s work in independent theatre has seen her: win two best cabaret artist awards at the Adelaide Fringe; score a nomination for best musical direction at the Sydney Theatre Awards (for Once); take on the role of musical director on musicals Lizzie and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes; and co-create and host the sold-out Sydney Festival work Smashed - The Brunch Party.\\n “Now I’m back and it’s exactly what musical theatre wants,” she says. “It feels like even the most mainstream of audiences are interested in not only seeing stories that reflect themselves, but also reflect the other people that they know and love around them.”\\n That philosophy drives the programming at Hayes Theatre, an independent company that makes new and traditional musical theatre with a vast and diverse array of creative people. Falconer attributes part of that ethos to her background.\\n “People of colour, creatives of colour, we’ve worked from a place of deficit for so long, that having to find inventive, exciting ways to do stuff means that our work is exciting,” she says.\\n “I know that that’s a huge generalisation. But we work outside of the borders anyway. We have to find ways around the rules to do things. Not just with telling our stories, but with how we actually put them on stage. So play is part of that culture of telling you stories.”\\n Catherine Van-Davies, co-artistic director at Sydney’s Old Fitz Theatre (with Alexander Berlage and Constantine Costi), agrees. The Vietnamese Australian actor says one of the main tenets of programming at the Old Fitz is “de-centring” ideas of what makes good theatre.\\n “We need to burst open concepts of what theatre is,” she says. “Encompass many multidisciplinary approaches to it and many makers from different walks of life. That immediately asks the audience to start opening themselves up to receiving stories differently.\\n “For those from marginalised communities, or historically underrepresented communities, we operate in a constant state of translation with the stories that are provided to us.\\n “So we become multilingual in an emotional sense, in a cultural sense, in a huge array of ways, and that is an exciting thing to offer to audiences, because they also have the capacity to do the same thing.”\\n Falconer and Van-Davies are leading some of the most diverse, original and inventive programming in Sydney theatre, from their relatively small independent companies.\\n They are as passionate about spearheading change as they are about supporting and creating work that upends traditional boundaries in theatre.\\n Neither dismisses older or conventionally traditional works. Nor do they believe progressive or cutting-edge performance requires a one-size-fits-all approach.\\n But both, along with their artistic director colleagues, want their theatres, and theatre generally, to burst at the seams with diversity, opportunity and perspectives that break theatre conventions.\\n “We don’t want to just be mimicking what subsidised theatres can do,” Van-Davies says. “We want to be offering a space in which artists can be true to their vision, without compromise. Enable them to take bold and risky offers, to delve into their practice in a deeper and more experimental way.\\n “Because of the many costs involved in the larger state theatre companies, they can’t take those kinds of risks.\\n “We want artists to have a really clear, open voice in our spaces. And that’s naturally going to bring in voices from less represented communities, I think.”\\n At the Old Fitz, overseen by Red Line Productions, the diversity of work has ranged from Chewing Gum Dreams by UK playwright Michaela Coel (I May Destroy You) to New Balance‘s stories of the queer, disabled experience; Cheryn Frost’s experimental work Volcanoes & Vulvas; and Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Alexander Berlage and featuring Van-Davies as Stella.\\n Hayes has recently programmed Lizzie, director Maeve Marsden’s “queer grunge” take on the story of Lizzie Borden, a theatre adaptation of Gentleman Prefer Blondes, new Laura Murphy (Bell Shakespeare’s The Lovers) musical Zombie, and The Lucky Country, with music and lyrics by composer and Six the Musical star Vidya Makan.\\n Falconer, who was named one of the 40 under 40 most influential Asian-Australians for 2022, for her leadership in arts and culture, is also a founding member of The People of Cabaret, an initiative that advocates for artists of colour.\\n Falconer and Van-Davies agree programming new theatre, whether fresh takes on old work or experimental pieces with little precedent, doesn’t mean tearing apart the rulebook.\\n “Using the rules to destabilise a little bit is often enough, because it means that it’s also not too threatening,” Falconer says.\\n Van-Davies reiterates the need to support artists.\\n “I want artists to feel uncompromised,” she says. “I want them to feel like they have a place in this world, even if they’ve not seen it reflected back previously.\\n “Theatre is an ecosystem and I want them to have their voice in it.”\\n A Streetcar Named Desire is at Old Fitz Theatre until July 1. The Lucky Country is at Hayes Theatre until June 17.\\n Sydney Morning Herald subscribers can enjoy 2-for-1 tickets* to the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes exhibition at the Art Gallery of New South Wales during June 2023.
