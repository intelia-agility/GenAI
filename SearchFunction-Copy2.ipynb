       "   'headline': 'Yes, Trump could run for president from prison. One candidate did it in 1920',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><strong>Washington:</strong> Eugene V. Debs did not speak on election night in 1920. The Socialist presidential contender was, in his words, a “candidate in seclusion,” imprisoned in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary for speaking out against America’s draft during World War I.</p> <p>Outside the lockup, his supporters handed out photos of Debs in convict denim along with campaign buttons for “Prisoner 9653”. Reporters had hoped to hear a fiery oration. But the warden did let Debs write out a statement.</p> <p>“I thank the capitalist masters for putting me here,” he wrote. “They know where I belong under their criminal and corrupting system. It is the only compliment they could pay me.”</p> <p>In 1920, Debs was no stranger to White House bids; he’d run for president on the Socialist Party ticket five times since 1900. Eight years earlier, he’d won 901,551 votes - about 6 per cent of the vote. However, this time he was politicking from behind bars.</p> <p>Now, after former president Donald Trump’s <a href=\"http://p5ctrh\" target=\"_blank\">indictment by a grand jury</a> in New York – making him the first ex-president in history to be charged with a crime – many voters are wondering whether Trump, who is seeking a return to the White House in 2024, could still run for president if he ended up in jail.</p> <p>In short, yes. Case in point: Debs.</p> <p>Debs had opposed US involvement in World War I, believing the war benefited only arms manufacturers and business interests. In July 1918, while speaking in a Canton, Ohio, city park, he denounced the “Junkers of Wall Street” and criticised the government for arresting antiwar activists.</p> <p>“The working class who freely shed their blood and furnish the corpses have never yet had a voice in either declaring war or making peace,” he said. “It is the ruling class that invariably does both. They alone declare war, and they alone make peace.”</p> <p>Under the Sedition Act of 1918, such words were treasonous. The act, an amendment to the Espionage Act of 1917, sought to silence those who spoke out about the war.</p> <p>Federal prosecutor Edwin Wertz, who had sent a stenographer to the park, announced he would indict Debs.</p> <p>“No man,” Wertz said, “even though four times the candidate of his party for the highest office in the land, can violate the basic law of this land.”</p> <p>Through his rabble-rousing orations, Debs had been the public – and charismatic – face of socialism. He founded the Socialist Party of America in 1901, but its roots went back to his work as a union organiser in the rail yards.</p> <p>In the 16 years before the United States entered World War I, the Socialists elected congressmen in New York City and Milwaukee and put 40 mayors into city halls around the country.</p> <p>In April 1917, only days after the United States entered the war, the party ratified an antiwar platform.</p> <p>Though he ran for president five times, Debs was a reluctant leader. And he knew his campaigns were symbolic.</p> <p>“There was virtually no chance that a Socialist (or any third-party candidate) would ever get the votes needed to break through the electoral college, so at best the party’s national ticket for president and vice president was always a way to raise awareness and encourage further organising of working-class people,” said Wesley Bishop, a historian at the Eugene V. Debs Foundation.</p> <p>Debs’s trial for sedition was a mess. In testimony, it became clear that Wertz’s stenographer – a car salesman – had failed to transcribe most of the speech. Wertz called several draft-age men in a vain attempt to prove the speech discouraged registration. However, each one had registered, and one was even in uniform.</p> <p>The defence called only one witness to the stand: Debs, who promptly admitted his guilt. Ignoring objections from prosecutors, the judge then allowed him to address the court for nearly two hours.</p> <p>“What you may choose to do to me will be of small consequence after all,” Debs said, concluding his remarks. “I am not on trial here. There is an infinitely greater issue that is being tried in this court today. American institutions are on trial before a court of American citizens. Time will tell.”</p> <p>The jury found him guilty. On November 18, 1918 – a week after Armistice Day – he was sentenced to three concurrent 10-year sentences and lost his right to vote. Though he appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court, Justice Oliver Holmes jnr found a clear intention to obstruct the draft.</p> <p>So he ran for president from prison. In 1920, two years into Debs’s sentence, he garnered 913,693 votes, his highest vote total ever, and impressive considering he couldn’t make a single campaign stop or stump speech.</p> <p>He promised that, if elected, he would pardon himself, something Trump has also considered. The winning candidate, Republican Warren G. Harding, promised a “return to normalcy”, restoring the prewar way of life.</p> <p>Soon after Harding was inaugurated in March 1921, the warden at the federal prison in Atlanta drove Debs to the rail station. The prisoner boarded a train for a trip to Washington – unaccompanied and unsupervised – to meet with Attorney-General Harry Daugherty at Harding’s behest. They met for three hours, then Debs quietly returned to prison.</p> <p>The White House planned to keep the meeting secret, but Daugherty, a blustery politician, bragged about it to reporters. When the news hit the papers, veterans groups protested and Harding now had to factor in the political optics of their opposition. He finally released Debs on December 21, 1921 – just in time for Christmas.</p> <p>“He is an old man, not strong physically,” said Harding when commuting the sentence to time served.</p> <p>“He is a man of much personal charm and impressive personality, which qualifications make him a dangerous man calculated to mislead the unthinking and affording excuse for those with criminal intent.”</p> <p>Perhaps the same could one day be said of Trump.</p> <p><strong>Washington Post</strong></p> <p><b><i>Get a note directly from our foreign </i></b><b><i>correspondents </i></b><b><i>on what’s making headlines around the world. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56l7u\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Sign up for the weekly What in the World newsletter here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Trump boasted he could shoot someone and not lose a vote. What about a sex abuse finding?',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>At the outset of his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump famously said, “I could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and not lose any voters.” Today, after being“I could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and not lose any voters.”, Trump can say, “I can beat a rape charge and even sustain conviction of a witch-hunt phoney hoax sexual assault charge on Fifth Avenue, and not lose any voters.”</p> <p>Carroll is very courageous. We know from experience here, with <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/jarryd-hayne-3hs\" target=\"_blank\">Jarryd Hayne’s case</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/jarryd-hayne-3hs\" target=\"_blank\">Jarryd Hayne’s case</a>, how searing and arduous it is for women to obtain a conviction after alleging that they were raped. That a jury substantially believed Carroll about events she related from 30 years ago is proof that justice can prevail.</p> <p>But Trump is somehow able to defy political gravity that would claim other mortals. No chief executive of a listed company in the United States can keep his job if even an accusation of sexual impropriety is made. Just two weeks ago, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/09/business/cnbc-hadley-gamble.html\" target=\"_blank\">head of NBC Universal was forced to resign for an “inappropriate relationship” with a woman in the company</a>. Trump, the former president who was impeached twice, and who is facing further criminal proceedings from New York to Georgia to Washington DC on charges of corrupting political and electoral processes, is not only still in the game to return as the Republican presidential nominee – but is the frontrunner today. It is astonishing.</p> <p>Trump has one playbook: deny, defame, discredit. Never admit, never concede, never retreat. Always appeal. Right after the verdict, Trump posted that the court proceedings were a “disgrace” and a “witch-hunt” comprised of Democratic Party justice from Democratic prosecutors and a Democratic judge in the Democratic city of New York. America’s politics are so infested with rancid hyper partisanship that even deeply scarred candidates for the House and Senate who lie about their careers or who are accused of sexual assault are not denied a place on the ballot by Republican voters.</p> <p>This is the political currency Trump has minted and spends with abandon to keep control and to keep winning. What Trump is in jeopardy of losing, however, is his ability to win back independent voters – the equivalent of teal voters in Australia – in the suburbs around major cities across the country. Moderate voters are absorbing the Carroll judgment. Together with Trump’s extremism on guns, abortion rights and culture war issues, swing states and swing House and Senate seats come into play for the Democrats.</p> <p>Trump’s Republican opponents for the presidential nomination are dying to beat him but, so far, they are unwilling to decisively break with him – because they could lose support from the Trump base if they do. As Peggy Noonan, one of Ronald Reagan’s most gifted advisers and writers, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/news/author/peggy-noonan\" target=\"_blank\">wrote last week:</a> “He’s never been the focus, onstage, of a serious, capable, sustained assault on policy or comportment. No one on his side has ever challenged him to his face on how and why he failed as president. No one knows if he could take it. He doesn’t know. To defeat Mr Trump, you have to attack him. But here, they say, is the problem: If you attack Mr Trump, his base will never forgive you.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3970519-trump-widens-lead-over-desantis-to-37-points-in-new-poll/\" target=\"_blank\">Trump leads his principal opponent, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, 51 to 25 per cent</a>. If DeSantis or anyone else wants to take the Republican nomination away from Trump, they will have to take him down. They will have to convince Republican voters in the primaries next year that Trump is unfit to be president, that Trump will lose to Biden and that Trump will keep the Republicans from winning full control of Congress – which is what Trump failed to do in 2018, 2020 and 2022.</p> <p>President Joe Biden is running for re-election for two principal reasons: to “finish the job” he started in his first term of rebuilding America and delivering jobs and more economic security, and defeating Trump again to preserve America’s democracy.</p> <p>Biden believes he can do it. But can he? A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/07/president-biden-post-abc-poll/\" target=\"_blank\">shock <em>Washington Post</em> – ABC News poll</a> last weekend sent tremors through the Democrats. Trump is leading Biden 47 to 42 per cent. Forty-four per cent of US adults say they will definitely or probably vote for Trump; only 38 per cent for Biden. Only 32 per cent think Biden has the mental sharpness, at age 80, to do the job. Fifty-four per cent think Trump, at 76, is able. Nearly 60 per cent of Democratic-leaning voters wish another person was the nominee. Biden has an approval rating of just 36 per cent – the lowest of his presidency.</p> <p>Today’s verdict in New York nevertheless does open the character issue on Trump once again. Together with any further indictments in the weeks ahead, this will crystallise the issue of whether Trump can be a full-time president or a full-time defendant.</p> <p>Today, Trump feels he can stroll down Fifth Avenue, saunter into Bergdorf Goodman, and say they will be happy to have such a famous customer shopping again in their store.</p> <p>And the media will be all over it. </p> <p><b><i>The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own. </i></b><b><i>Sign up here</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>Volodymyr Zelensky says there is no “expiration date” on Ukraine’s willingness to fight Russia. But it is becoming increasingly hard to ignore the potential shelf life of America’s support for his cause.</p> <p>Matt Gaetz, the ultra-MAGA lawmaker who led the move on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT) to eject Kevin McCarthy as Republican Speaker, cited an alleged secret side deal McCarthy made with <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/biden-pleads-with-congress-not-to-end-us-support-for-ukraine-20231002-p5e919\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Biden to keep funding Ukraine</a>.</p> <p>This was in spite of the fact McCarthy had struck $US6 billion in Ukrainian aid from last weekend’s deal to keep the US government open. It capped a bleak few days for Zelensky. Even assuming the next Speaker is sympathetic to Ukraine, they would be in an even weaker position than McCarthy.</p> <p>The Republican party has been moving in Russia’s direction for a while. More than eight in 10 Republican voters now support candidates – Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis and <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/republicans-first-millennial-candidate-wants-an-american-revolution-20230723-p5dqi7\" target=\"_blank\">Vivek Ramaswamy</a> – who would sever aid to Ukraine.</p> <p>Roughly half of Americans likewise want to pull the plug. For the first time since the 1920s, Americans are likely to be given the option next year of putting an isolationist in the White House. That would be a fateful choice.</p> <p>The “isolationist” label is often misused. It does not automatically mean neutrality in fights between foreigners, though that sentiment was a feature of the US republic at its birth. It can also mean bias towards one side.</p> <p>Charles Lindbergh, who headed the America First Committee in the early stages of the second world war, made his sympathies for Nazi Germany plain. All kinds of supporters – pacifists, big business and anti-Semites – flocked to his banner.</p> <h2>Main threat is China</h2> <p>Today’s rising isolationism is not about even-handedness between Russia and Ukraine; its driving force comes from Republicans in sympathy with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>The others are getting sidelined or pushed out. In an effort to keep his job, McCarthy refused Zelensky’s request to address Congress when he was in Washington two weeks ago. Last Saturday, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, tried to pass a separate bill that would have reinstated the Ukrainian funding. He was blocked by Republican colleagues.</p> <p>America’s two parties broadly agree that China poses the main challenge to US hegemony. Russia, however, is a real-time arsonist in the western neighbourhood.</p> <p>US isolationism’s roots were about avoiding entanglements with Europe. It did not have much to say about the rest of the world. Lindbergh volunteered in the Pacific after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbour.</p> <p>The country’s postwar isolationists, led by Senator Robert Taft, opposed NATO’s creation in 1949 yet were outraged by America’s failure the same year to stop China’s communist revolution.</p> <p>“Who lost China?” was an isolationist rallying cry. A similar pattern is visible today. Isolationist Republicans say the Ukraine war is diverting America’s focus from the true threat in China.</p> <h2>Isolationists tend to fail</h2> <p>Ramaswamy refers to Zelensky as “their Pope” – pointing at pro-Ukraine colleagues. Beijing, on the other hand, wants to turn Americans into “Chinese serfs”.</p> <p>The imminent threat assessment points to Moscow. Putin has been explicit about his plans to re-establish the <em>russky mir</em> (Russian world). He dismembered Georgia in 2008, seized Crimea in 2014, launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and then annexed four Ukrainian regions.</p> <p>The last time Chinese forces invaded another country was Vietnam in 1979; it went badly. Today’s most overblown fears about China’s designs sound more like a replay of the 1950s McCarthyite “red scare” than a balanced appraisal of America’s current risks.</p> <p>History tells us that isolationists usually fail. But they can alter its course for key stretches of time. The Senate defeat of Woodrow Wilson’s League of Nations in 1920 removed America from Europe’s chessboard for two decades.</p> <p>Regimes that posed deep threats to America filled the vacuum. Then, like today, Americans understandably thought that Europe should put its own house in order. America has supplied the lion’s share of western equipment and intelligence to Ukraine. Few, however, would bet on Europe stepping into an isolationist America’s shoes.</p> <p>To keep the US in the game, Biden must somehow wangle enough Republican votes in the coming weeks to replenish Ukrainian funding. The absence of a big Ukrainian military breakthrough makes his job that much harder.</p> <p>So does the fact that the MAGA base nowadays demonises Zelensky almost as much as it does George Soros. Then there is next year’s presidential election. An America Firster in the White House could sink Ukraine’s prospects.</p> <p>Trump, as ever, is the Hail Mary that Putin is seeking.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong>Kyiv, Ukraine:</strong> Russian forces struck a grain terminal in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, Ukrainian officials said on Saturday, extending a bombardment of the country’s infrastructure that has raised alarm about Kyiv’s ability to ship grain to the world.</p> <p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has vowed to enhance air defences around the port and the southern coast, but Kyiv’s resources are stretched thin and it faces difficult choices about where to deploy the limited number of air defence systems that can shoot down Russia’s most sophisticated missiles.</p> <p>Ukraine continues to ask its Western allies to speed up the delivery of more air defence systems and warn that continued Russian bombardment could leave it without the necessary infrastructure to ship grain even if Black Sea shipping lanes reopen. Moscow has struck Ukrainian ports nearly daily since pulling out of a deal last week that allowed Ukraine to ship its grain despite the war.</p> <p>“In two or three months, we may not have a single port left,” Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for the Ukrainian military southern command, told French journalists this past week. “They want to dominate the Black Sea. They want to have a monopoly on grain,” she said.</p> <p>On Saturday, Humeniuk said Ukraine had taken measures to better protect the ports but warned that Russia may once again be adjusting its tactics before striking again.</p> <p>The attack reported on Saturday hit a grain terminal in the Beryslav district and was one of 29 attacks by Russian forces directed at Kherson in the past 24 hours, the Ukrainian military said. At least four civilians were injured in those attacks, which were carried out with mortars, artillery, tanks and aircraft, the Ukrainian military said.</p> <p>The bombardment of the port city came as tensions in the waters off the southern coast of Ukraine continued to rise, with Kyiv accusing Russian warships of threatening a civilian vessel and Russia’s Black Sea fleet running drills off Ukraine’s southern coast this month. Moscow has warned that any ships sailing to Ukraine’s ports would be considered potentially hostile.</p> <p>The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said on Friday that the Russian naval posture in the Black Sea, which includes a warning that ships bound for Ukrainian ports would be potentially seen as carrying military cargo, was most “likely intentionally ambiguous to generate widespread concern about possible detention by the Russian navy or outright strikes on civilian vessels”.</p> <p>Ukraine has vowed to step up its efforts to target Russian warships and vessels using Russian ports and has been working to expand its fleet of naval drones, which it has used to attack and harass the Russian Black Sea fleet.</p> <p>In apparent recognition of the danger they pose, Russian authorities announced a night-time navigation ban for all small vessels near the Kerch Strait. This month, Ukraine used naval drones in an attack on the Kerch Strait Bridge, which links the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula to Russia and is a primary supply route for Russian troops fighting in the south of Ukraine. The attack left the roadway badly damaged. The rail line over the bridge, however, is functioning, and Ukraine has vowed to continue mounting attacks.</p> <p>African leaders meeting President Vladimir Putin of Russia at a summit in St Petersburg on Friday called for the revival of the Black Sea grain deal, saying the continent was disproportionately affected by disruptions to the global food supply, while stopping short of directly criticising Moscow for pulling out of the agreement.</p> <p>“The grain deal must be extended for the benefit of all the peoples of the world, Africans in particular,” Moussa Faki Mahamat, chair of the African Union Commission, said at a Russia-Africa summit on Friday. “This conflict is now directly affecting us as well,” President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said.</p> <p>President Azali Assoumani of Comoros, chair of the African Union, said Russia’s promise of free grain for six African nations announced this week was “important but maybe not enough”.</p> <p>But Putin at a news conference late on Saturday offered no sign that he might rejoin the grain deal. Instead, he said Russia stood to profit because global grain prices had risen after Russia exited the agreement.</p> <p>“That means our companies will make more, which means we will get more in taxes,” Putin said. “If we get more in taxes, we will share part of our income with the poorest countries and will supply a certain volume of production for free.”</p> <p>The African leaders also tried to advance their effort to broker a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, but Putin poured cold water on the idea. A ceasefire would be unworkable, he said, because Ukraine was mounting a counteroffensive. “The Ukrainian army is on the offensive. They are attacking,” Putin said. “Why ask us for a ceasefire?”</p> <p>On Saturday, the Ukrainian president said he had travelled to the Donetsk region in the country’s east “to congratulate our warriors” and to “honour their strength”. In one of a series of posts on social media accompanied by photographs with soldiers, he said he had heard a commander’s report but could not share details of current operations.</p> <p>Along with pushing towards the south, Ukraine is trying to advance eastwards in the direction of Bakhmut, which fell to Russian forces in May after months of bloody fighting.</p> <p>Two people were killed and a third was injured when a Russian missile struck an open area in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Saturday, the secretary of the city council, Anatolii Kurtiev, said on Telegram. Kurtiev added that the blast had blown out the windows of apartments in 13 high-rise buildings nearby and that the city had social workers and other support services on the scene to help residents who were affected.</p> <p>On Friday evening, at least one missile strike in the city of Dnipro, in central Ukraine, damaged a high-rise apartment building, hours after Russia accused Kyiv of firing missiles at two Russian cities.</p> <p>Rescue efforts were completed overnight, the regional military administration said on Saturday morning. Nine people, including two children, were injured, local officials said. There were no casualties reported at the apartment building. The 12-storey building was new, and many apartments were still unoccupied, local residents said.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-grain.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><em>Riyadh</em> | President Joe Biden’s trip to Israel on Wednesday will put him in a region where grief and fury are mounting, not only towards Israel but also toward the United States, the world power that has declared unyielding support for its chief Middle East ally.</p> <p>On Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT), widespread condemnation of Israel rippled across the region after a huge explosion at a hospital in the Gaza Strip<a href=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/world-leaders-slam-israeli-strike-on-gaza-hospital-20231018-p5ed4k?post=p55c0z\" target=\"_blank\"> killed hundreds of Palestinians</a> who had been seeking treatment and refuge. Israel has denied being behind the blast, blaming another Palestinian group, Islamic Jihad, for a failed rocket launch.</p> <p>But even before that, many people across the region had come to view Israel’s war with Hamas — the Palestinian armed group that carried out a shocking attack on southern Israel last week, slaughtering 1400 people — as a US-backed massacre of Palestinian civilians in the blockaded territory of Gaza.</p> <p>Israel has cut off water, medicine and electricity in the enclave and continued to target Gaza with deadly airstrikes, bringing the death toll to at least 2800 before the hospital explosion.</p> <p>Many Arabs view the US government as being not only indifferent to the agony of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation but also complicit in it.</p> <p>US pledges of “ironclad” support for the country and no-strings-attached security assistance have stoked those feelings as Israel prepares for a ground invasion of Gaza.</p> <p>“There is tremendous anger in the Arab world, even by those who do not support Hamas,” said Nabil Fahmy, a former foreign minister of Egypt. “They are giving Israel a green light,” he said of Western powers, “and as this gets increasingly bloody, the West will have blood on its hands.”</p> <p>So intense is the anger that a refrain, “Death to America,” has found renewed resonance in the region, including during a protest on Friday in Bahrain, a close US ally.</p> <p>Many Palestinians and other Arabs said in interviews that the rhetoric coming from senior Israeli and American officials has been dehumanising and warmongering.</p> <p>When the war began, Mr Biden called the attacks by Hamas — in which gunmen killed Israeli soldiers and civilians and took nearly 200 people hostage — “pure, unadulterated evil”.</p> <p>The Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: “We are fighting human animals. There will be no Hamas; we will eliminate everything.”</p> <p>As he travelled around the region over the past week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken signalled that the Biden administration would have a high tolerance for whatever resulted from Israel’s military response to the Hamas attacks.</p> <p>Diana Buttu, a Palestinian citizen of Israel who has worked as a lawyer on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, said she had never harboured “any illusions” about the US role in the conflict, knowing that America firmly backed Israel.</p> <p>Even so, she said, she was stunned by the Biden administration’s response. “It’s like somebody has ripped out my guts,” she said. “This level of siding with Israel is genocidal.”</p> <p>In the broader Middle East, many people do not view Israel as the victim of an unprovoked terrorist attack — as some American officials have described it — but as a colonial-style occupier that has been buttressed by the United States and which has oppressed the Palestinians for decades.</p> <p>Khalid Al-Dakhil, a prominent Saudi public intellectual, said that what frustrated him the most was Western powers’ “blind adoption of the Israeli narrative of events”.</p> <p>“You are against occupation in Ukraine; can you deny that the Palestinians are under occupation?” he said.</p> <p>“Nobody is asking you to go and declare war on the Israelis because they are occupying the Palestinians; people are asking you to be rational, wise and convince your allies — push them to their senses.”</p> <p>American officials appear to have softened their statements lately, stressing that Palestinian civilians should not suffer because of Hamas.</p> <p>On Sunday, the State Department appointed David Satterfield — a veteran diplomat with experience in Arab countries — as a special envoy for humanitarian issues to help address the crisis in Gaza.</p> <p>And in an interview with <em>60 Minutes</em> on CBS, Mr Biden discouraged Israel from fully reoccupying Gaza, which Hamas has controlled for more than a decade.</p> <p>Still, when he was asked if he disagreed with the siege of Gaza, he said he was confident Israel would obey the rules of war, noting the “standards that democratic institutions and countries go by”.</p> <h2>Battered image</h2> <p>Even if the US administration walks back its stance, the damage to its battered image in the Middle East is done, said Hafsa Halawa, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based research organisation.</p> <p>“The Americans have zero moral standing in this region,” she said. “They come across now as a country that does not know what to do with itself if it’s not at war.”</p> <p>As Israel prepares for a ground invasion of Gaza, a densely populated urban area, American military officers with memories of the battle for the Iraqi city of Fallujah in 2004 — a struggle against Iraqi insurgents that became some of the bloodiest urban combat in recent decades — have been conveying the lessons of that experience to their Israeli counterparts.</p> <p>Ms Halawa said that the past week reminded her of the atmosphere in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the lead-up to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>“What we’re really in, if you watch the news for five minutes, is genuine, pure 9/11 Islamophobia,” she said. “Twenty-three years later, we’re in exactly the same language. The Americans have learned nothing.”</p> <h2>Frustration with US</h2> <p>In Iraq, which is still struggling in the aftermath of that war, the dominant sentiment was weariness as people watched events unfold in Israel and Gaza. There was also a mix of anger and disappointment.</p> <p>“America does not care if a thousand or a million or a billion Arabs and Muslims die, as long as its interests are not harmed,” said Moayad Jubeir, a professor of law and political science at Anbar University.</p> <p>Still, there was one thing that the United States could do, Iraqis said: Keep the war with Hamas contained.</p> <p>Frustration with the United States has grown across the region as Mr Blinken’s diplomatic tour presented the unusual spectacle of authoritarian Arab rulers lecturing American officials about human rights.</p> <p>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, told him that Israel must lift its siege on Gaza and that the kingdom “rejects the destruction of infrastructure and vital services that affect their daily lives”.</p> <p>In Egypt, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi falsely claimed that Jews in his country had never experienced persecution and suggested that the United States was more shocked by the killing of Israelis than decades of Palestinian oppression.</p> <p>“Yes, it is true what happened over the past nine days was very difficult and too much, and we unequivocally condemn it,” Mr El-Sissi told Mr Blinken about the Hamas attacks.</p> <p>“But we need to understand that this is the result of accumulated fury and hatred over four decades, where the Palestinians had no hope to find a solution.”</p> <p>After the explosion Tuesday at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, denunciations flowed in from Arab countries. Turkey, Qatar and Iran were among those blaming Israel.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry swiftly released a statement blaming the attack on the Israeli military, demanding that the international community “let go of its double standards” to hold Israel accountable.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/world/middleeast/biden-israel-gaza-anger.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><em>San Francisco</em> | Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, two top executives at OpenAI who left the company after a dramatic board meeting on Friday (Saturday AEDT), are talking again with board members about returning to the artificial intelligence startup, in what would amount to a spectacular counter-coup.</p> <p>The discussions follow an outcry after Mr Altman, 38, was ousted from his role as OpenAI’s CEO. Since then, OpenAI’s investors and Mr Altman’s supporters have pressured the four board members of the startup to bring Mr Altman back, six people with knowledge of the situation said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential.</p> <p>Microsoft, which has invested $US13 billion ($20 billion) in OpenAI, was leading the pressure campaign, one of the people said. OpenAI investors who have expressed support for Mr Altman to be reinstated were also willing to invest if he were to start a new company, something he began discussing almost immediately after he was forced out, people with knowledge of the situation said.</p> <h2>Blindsided and furious</h2> <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been in touch with Mr Altman and pledged to support him in whatever steps he takes next, the people said. Mr Nadella was blindsided and furious by the board’s decision on Friday, according to people familiar with the situation.</p> <p>There is no guarantee that Mr Altman or Mr Brockman will be reinstated at OpenAI, the people said. Because of OpenAI’s unique structure — it is controlled by a nonprofit and its board has the power to govern the activities of the subsidiary, where its AI work is done — the company’s investors have no official say in what happens to the startup or who leads it.</p> <p>OpenAI, Microsoft and Thrive Capital, the largest OpenAI investor aside from Microsoft, declined to comment.</p> <p>The new discussions between Mr Altman, Mr Brockman and OpenAI’s board were the latest twist in a fast-moving drama at what is perhaps the world’s highest-profile AI company.</p> <p>The San Francisco startup shot to fame last year when it released the chatbot ChatGPT and showed the power of artificial intelligence. Mr Altman, a founder of OpenAI, rapidly became the face of the AI industry as Google, Meta and other giants raced to take the lead in the technology.</p> <p>But on Friday, <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/openai-s-altman-ousted-murati-named-interim-ceo-20231118-p5ekyr\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI abruptly announced</a> that its board had removed Altman as CEO, saying “he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board.” The board did not elaborate.</p> <p>Mr Altman was asked to join a video meeting with OpenAI’s board at noon Friday and was immediately fired, Mr Brockman has said. Mr Brockman said that even though he was chair of the company’s board, he was not part of the meeting. He later said he was quitting the company.</p> <p>OpenAI had six board members before Mr Altman was forced out and Mr Brockman left. The other four are Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI founder; Adam D’Angelo, CEO of Quora, the question-and-answer site; Helen Toner, a director of strategy at Georgetown’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology; and Tasha McCauley, an entrepreneur and computer scientist.</p> <h2>Rising tensions</h2> <p>Before Mr Altman’s ouster, tensions had been rising at OpenAI as the company’s profile soared. In particular, Mr Sutskever, a respected AI researcher, had grown increasingly worried that OpenAI’s technology could be dangerous and that Mr Altman was not paying enough attention to that risk, three people familiar with his thinking have said.</p> <p>Mr Sutskever also objected to what he saw as his diminished role inside the company.</p> <p>Mr Altman’s firing drew attention to a longtime division in the AI community between people who believe AI is the biggest business opportunity in a generation and others who worry that moving too fast could be dangerous.</p> <p>His exit also caused waves across the tech industry, where Mr Altman is well known not only from OpenAI but from his years leading Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley startup incubator. Many of OpenAI’s investors — which include Microsoft, Thrive Capital and Sequoia Capital — did not learn about Mr Altman’s exit until a minute before his departure was announced or after the news became public.</p> <p>By Friday evening, Mr Altman and Mr Brockman were racing to set up a new AI company, three people familiar with the situation have said. They also considered which OpenAI employees would join them. At least three other OpenAI employees have resigned over the last two days.</p> <p>Tech investors rushed to show their support for <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/ai-and-crypto-king-sam-altman-wants-your-eyeballs-literally-20230808-p5duxfhttps://www.afr.com/technology/ai-and-crypto-king-sam-altman-wants-your-eyeballs-literally-20230808-p5duxf\" target=\"_blank\">Mr Altman and hinted that they would back his next venture.</a></p> <p>Alfred Lin, an investor at Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm that invested in OpenAI and Mr Altman’s first startup, Loopt, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he looked forward to “the next world-changing company” that Mr Altman and Mr Brockman would build. Eric Schmidt, Google’s former CEO, posted, “I can’t wait to see what he does next.”</p> <p>While still leading OpenAI, Mr Altman had pitched several ideas for new projects to investors and others in recent months. During a fundraising trip last month in the Middle East, Mr Altman spoke about AI-related projects, including a plan to develop custom chips for AI that would compete with the chip company Nvidia.</p> <p>Mr Altman also spoke with Masayoshi Son, the CEO and billionaire founder of the tech conglomerate SoftBank, about investing in an effort to build an AI device with Jony Ive, the former chief design officer at Apple.</p> <p>But by Saturday afternoon, Mr Altman and Mr Brockman were also talking with the OpenAI about a return.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/technology/sam-altman-openai-board.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'ExxonMobil buys US shale giant in $93 billion fossil fuel deal',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>ExxonMobil agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources for $US59.5 billion ($93 billion) in the world’s largest takeover announced this year, doubling down on fossil fuel production even as many global policymakers grow increasingly concerned about climate change and the oil industry’s reluctance to shift to cleaner energy.</p> <p>The deal is the oil giant’s biggest acquisition since merging with Mobil Corp in 1999, and after decades of investments in projects around the world, will squarely lodge Exxon’s future close to its Houston base, with most of its oil production in Texas and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and along the coast of Guyana.</p> <p>By concentrating its production close to home, Exxon is effectively betting that US energy policy will not move against fossil fuels in a major way even as the Biden administration encourages carmakers to switch to electric vehicles and utilities to make the transition to renewable energy.</p> <p>Exxon executives have said that in addition to producing more fossil fuels, the company is building a new business that will capture carbon dioxide from industrial sites and bury the greenhouse gas in the ground. The technology to do that remains in an early stage and has not been successfully used on a large scale.</p> <p>“The combined capabilities of our two companies will provide long-term value creation well in excess of what either company is capable of doing on a stand-alone basis,” said Darren Woods, Exxon’s CEO.</p> <p>American oil production has reached a record of roughly 13 million barrels a day, around 13 per cent of the global market, but growth has slowed in recent years. Despite a wave of consolidation among oil and gas companies, and higher oil prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year, producers are having a more difficult time finding new locations to drill.</p> <p>The Pioneer deal is a sign that it is now easier to acquire an oil producer than to drill for oil in a new location.</p> <p>Exxon, a refining and petrochemical powerhouse, needs a lot more oil and gas to turn into petrol, diesel, plastics, liquefied natural gas, chemicals and other products. Much of that oil and gas is likely to come from the Permian basin, the most productive US oil and gas field, which straddles Texas and New Mexico and where Pioneer is a major player.</p> <p>Exxon’s $US10 billion Golden Pass terminal near the Texas-Louisiana border is scheduled to begin shipping liquefied natural gas to the rest of the world next year. Gas bubbles up with oil from the Permian basin, making the basin all the more valuable for exports as Europe weans itself from Russian gas.</p> <p>The Pioneer deal is bigger than the company’s ill-fated $US30 billion acquisition of XTO Energy, a major natural gas producer, in 2010. Exxon had to write off much of that investment later when natural gas prices collapsed from the high levels that prevailed when it bought XTO.</p> <p>By buying Pioneer now, when the US oil benchmark is around $US83 a barrel, Exxon is counting on prices remaining relatively high in the next few years.</p> <p>Exxon has been careful in recent years to invest modestly in new production as it raised its dividends and bought back more of its own stock. Buying Pioneer would add production, a big change in its strategy.</p> <p>The acquisition would make Exxon the dominant player in the Permian basin, far outpacing Chevron, its biggest rival.</p> <p>Pioneer has been a darling of Wall Street investors as it has capitalised on the shale drilling boom. Scott Sheffield, its CEO, got the company out of Alaska, Africa and offshore fields while buying up shale operations in the Permian at cheap prices. By 2020, it had become one of the biggest American drillers, with relatively low-cost production.</p> <p>Sheffield is retiring at the end of the year. His company has a market value of about $US50 billion, roughly one-eighth the size of Exxon. Many of its oil and gas fields are still untapped.</p> <p>“While the company has a solid succession plan in place, oil and gas markets have been volatile and the capital available to traditional oil and gas companies in the US has been limited,” said Peter McNally, an analyst at Third Bridge, a research and analytics firm.</p> <p>The deal would be Exxon’s first major acquisition since Woods became CEO in 2017, replacing Rex Tillerson, who went on to become US secretary of state.</p> <p>Exxon, which reported a record profit of $US56 billion last year, is flush with cash that it could invest in Pioneer’s untapped fields. Since Exxon is also a large producer in the Permian, analysts say the merger would bring greater efficiencies in operations of both companies.</p> <p>This is just the latest in a series of mergers and acquisitions in the oil industry in recent years. But it has been consolidating. Occidental Petroleum acquired Anadarko Petroleum four years ago for nearly $US40 billion, a deal that made Occidental a major competitor to Exxon and Chevron in the Permian basin. Pioneer spent more than $US10 billion buying two other Permian producers, Parsley Energy and DoublePoint Energy, in 2021.</p> <p>Exxon bought Denbury, a Texas energy company that owns pipelines that can transport carbon dioxide, for $US4.9 billion this year.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in The New York Times.</strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>In recent weeks, there has been a lot of discussion about <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/the-trump-loyalist-trying-to-destroy-hunter-biden-20230918-p5e5id\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Biden’s</a> age. He’s old. But you know what comes with age besides a slower gait and forgetting words? Wisdom – in particular, how to handle a high-stakes diplomatic encounter without blowing things up (or blowing things up before you want them to blow up).</p> <p>And that’s what I think I saw at the face-to-face meeting between Biden, 80, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday in New York.</p> <p>A lot of Israeli reporters and people I know were left depressed by the meeting because Netanyahu came out and told everyone how warm and friendly it was.</p> <p>And Biden spoke about the unbreakable bonds between the US and the Jewish state. Many Israelis so detest Netanyahu that they wanted Biden to publicly rebuke him over the judicial coup that Bibi has mounted – and when that didn’t happen, they thought the meeting was a huge missed opportunity.</p> <p>“I get it, I get it,” I told them. “But didn’t you see it?” I asked.</p> <p>“See what?” they responded.</p> <p>While Biden was publicly putting his right arm around Netanyahu’s shoulder – precisely to defuse any attacks from Republicans for being too tough on Israel – I hear the president was, so to speak, using his left hand to privately slip a homework assignment into Bibi’s pocket. It was like a magician at work; you’d need to find the instant replay in double slow-motion to see it.</p> <p>And do you know what that homework assignment said? My reporting suggests that it was broadly along these lines:</p> <p>“Bibi, you want this deal that would normalise relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. I want it too. But to get this deal, I’m going to have to do something really hard: forge a mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia and maybe agree to some kind of civil nuclear program for the kingdom under strict controls. The Saudi leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is going to have to do something really hard: normalise relations between the home of Islam’s two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, with the Jewish state. And now you’re going to have to do something hard too.</p> <p>“You’re going to have to agree to terms for normalisation with Saudi Arabia that will require you to verifiably curb Jewish settlements in the West Bank, improve living and travel conditions for Palestinians there, advance Palestinian administration over more of their populated areas in accordance with Oslo and generally agree to steps on the ground that preserve the option of a two-state solution, even though your coalition agreement advocates annexation.</p> <p>“Now, Bibi, I, as your dear old, close and warm friend, would never tell you how to run your politics, let alone ask you to blow up your crazy coalition by agreeing to terms that the far-right Jewish supremacists in your cabinet could never swallow. No, I would never do that. That would be intervening in your politics. That would be wrong. I’m just telling you, you’ve got homework to do, my dear old, close, warm buddy. And your homework is due in the next few weeks.”</p> <p>It was a master class in how a US president puts a fateful decision to an Israeli leader – one that poses to that Israeli leader the most excruciating challenge of his political career: Either blow up the extremist cabinet you’ve built to keep yourself out of jail and replace it with a national unity coalition, or blow up the chance for peace with Saudi Arabia, which could pave the way for Israel’s acceptance across the whole Muslim world.</p> <p>And Biden did it all by looking like what he actually is – one of Israel’s best friends ever – defusing any political blowback in America.</p> <p>I’m not getting into<a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/retiring-romney-urges-america-s-geriatric-leaders-to-step-aside-20230914-p5e4k2\" target=\"_blank\"> the debate</a> about whether Biden is too old to run for re-election. I’m just telling you that when it comes to diplomacy, age and experience are his greatest assets.</p> <p>By the way, I’m kind of old myself – just turned 70. But my vision is still 20/20. And the good thing about being old – and still having good vision – is that I don’t need instant replay to see a diplomatic magician at work.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/23/opinion/biden-netanyahu-meeting.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><em>Kyiv</em> | The war in Ukraine has prompted officials across Russia to scale back annual celebrations of Victory Day, the country’s most important national holiday, with more than 20 cities forgoing military parades and organisers calling off a popular nationwide march to honour veterans.</p> <p>Security concerns were most often cited for the rash of cancellations of events on Tuesday, but some analysts suggested that the unease had as much to do with fears about domestic disturbances.</p> <p>It is an unprecedented step in a country where the parades, which commemorate the triumph of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany in World War II, have become a signature event for President Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Over the years, he has cast the day not just as a celebration of a historic victory but also of Russia’s present-day need to <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/foreign-affairs/russia-launches-drone-swarm-on-ukraine-s-cities-20230509-p5d6uy\" target=\"_blank\">thwart the Western forces</a> he says are still trying to destroy it. More recently, he has tried to wrap Ukraine into that narrative, falsely depicting it as a Nazi redoubt.</p> <p>The country’s biggest parade, outside the Kremlin on Red Square, is still expected to be the usual display of raw military might, with row upon row of carefully choreographed soldiers marching amid weapons ranging from vintage tanks to intercontinental ballistic missiles. Mr Putin is also scheduled to address the nation.</p> <p>But outside Moscow, a recent spate of drone attacks against military or infrastructure targets in cities such as Sevastopol in Crimea, home port of the Black Sea fleet, as well as other attacks in the regions bordering Ukraine, have given officials pause. Not even the Kremlin has been immune, with two drones destroyed over Mr Putin’s office last week.</p> <p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine staked his nation’s own claim to the holiday, with an address on Monday drawing a parallel between World War II and the current war against Russian invaders. From now on, he said, May 9 will be called Europe Day, commemorating “the unity of all Europeans who destroyed Nazism and will defeat ruscism”, a Ukrainian term combining “Russian” and “fascism.”</p> <p>“We fought then and we fight now so that no one ever again enslaves other nations and destroys other countries,” he said.</p> <h2>‘Neo-Nazi scum’</h2> <p>In Russia, various regional governors have cited security concerns in cancelling Victory Day events. They have usually not gone into detail, but in Belgorod, a region bordering Ukraine, the governor suggested that slow-moving military vehicles and marching soldiers might make for inviting targets.</p> <p>“There will be no parade in order not to provoke the enemy with a large amount of equipment and soldiers crowded in the centre of Belgorod,” said the governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. “The refusal to hold the parade is related to the safety of the residents of the region.”</p> <p>Many areas have banned drone flights during the events, and the Readovka news outlet on Telegram reported that national guard units were issued anti-drone weapons.</p> <p>Igor Artamonov, the governor of the Lipetsk region, which is also near Ukraine, said his decision should not be misinterpreted.</p> <p>“We are not afraid, we are not raising our hands,” he wrote on Telegram. “No neo-Nazi scum will be able to mar the great Victory Day. But we also have no right to put people at risk. It’s clear to everyone that parades are held in strictly defined squares at strictly defined times.”</p> <p>The cancellation of the nationwide “Immortal Regiment” march, when ordinary Russians take to the streets to display pictures of their veteran forebears, is perhaps the most striking change. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the march was cancelled as a “precautionary measure” against possible attacks.</p> <p>Some governors said they did not want to gather large numbers of people in the midst of war. But some analysts suggested that the Kremlin might be nervous that putting big crowds of Russians on the streets at such an uneasy time could lead to civil unrest, even with Russia’s draconian wartime laws against protests.</p> <p>It might be especially volatile, analysts said, if thousands of people show up with pictures of those <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/europe/us-says-20000-russians-killed-in-ukraine-war-since-december-20230502-p5d4rr\" target=\"_blank\">newly killed in the war,</a> revealing the extent of a toll that the government has tried to conceal. Some portraits of soldiers killed in Ukraine were carried during last year’s celebrations, but the numbers were far smaller then, just two months into the fighting.</p> <p>“People will not come out with portraits of their great-grandfathers,” Elvira Vikhareva, a political activist, wrote on Facebook. “People will come out with portraits of their fathers, sons and brothers. The regiment will not turn out to be ‘immortal’, but very much mortal, and the scale will be visible.”</p> <p>Whatever the reason, Russian officials have been trying to promote an alternative, suggesting that people upload the portraits to a special website or affix portraits of their veteran forebears to their vehicles and apartment windows.</p> <p>Some local leaders far from Ukraine said they were cancelling their parades in solidarity with front-line regions. In the Pskov region, home to a famous paratrooper division that has been devastated by the fighting and implicated in potential war crimes, Governor Mikhail Vedernikov said that the sound of the fireworks would bother recuperating soldiers and that the money would be better spent on their needs.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/08/world/europe/russia-victory-day-celebrations.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

Comments have been especially prominent on X, according to the Anti-Defamation League and researchers.</p> <p>More than a dozen Jewish creators and celebrities this week confronted TikTok executives in a private meeting, urging them to do more to address a rise in antisemitism and harassment on the video service.</p> <p>In September, Mr Musk met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a Tesla factory in the San Francisco Bay Area after facing accusations of antisemitism.</p> <p>On Thursday morning, X sales employees asked about Mr Musk’s posts and what they could relay to their clients, according to messages seen by <em>The New York Times</em>. They also cited an article from Media Matters for America, a left-wing advocacy group, which showed that ads from major brands were appearing on X next to posts promoting white nationalist and Nazi perspectives.</p> <p>“A lot of large advertisers have been called out in this article,” one employee wrote.</p> <p>Another employee wrote that she was concerned because she worked with Apple, a major advertiser that was mentioned in the Media Matters piece, and asked if Mr Musk’s posts “were manipulated”.</p> <p>An employee responded that the company’s trust and safety team, which has experienced layoffs and resignations, was “actively looking into this”.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/technology/elon-musk-endorses-antisemitic-post-ibm.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>On Friday (Saturday AEDT), Silicon Valley Bank, a lender to some of the biggest names in the technology world, became <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/silicon-valley-bank-collapses-and-enters-receivership-20230311-p5cr8q\" target=\"_blank\">the largest bank to fail</a> since the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>The move put nearly $US175 billion ($266 billion) in customer deposits under the control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</p> <p>Here’s what we know so far about this developing story.</p> <h2>Regulators take over the bank</h2> <p>The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation shut down Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, less than two days after the bank tried to persuade clients not to pull their money over concerns it was running low on available cash. The regulator appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp as the receiver.</p> <p>The FDIC created a new bank, the National Bank of Santa Clara, to hold the deposits and other assets of the failed one. The agency said in a news release that the new entity would be operating by Monday morning and that checks issued by the old bank would continue to clear.</p> <h2>Bank was caught by higher interest rates</h2> <p>Flush with cash from high-flying start-ups, Silicon Valley Bank bought huge amounts of bonds more than a year ago. Like other banks, Silicon Valley Bank kept a small amount of the deposits on hand and invested the rest with the hope of earning a return.</p> <p>That had worked well until the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates last year to cool inflation. At the same time, start-up funding started to dry up, putting pressure on many of the bank’s clients – who then began to withdraw their money.</p> <p>To pay those requests, Silicon Valley Bank was forced to sell off some of its investments at a time when their value had declined. In its surprise disclosure on Wednesday, the bank said it had lost nearly $US2 billion.</p> <h2>Bank’s failure is raising concerns about other banks</h2> <p>Silicon Valley Bank is small by comparison with the nation’s largest banks – its $US209 billion in assets pales next to the more than $US3 trillion at JPMorgan Chase. But bank runs can happen when customers or investors panic and start pulling their deposits.</p> <p>Perhaps the most immediate concern late this week was that the failure of Silicon Valley Bank would scare off customers of other banks.</p> <p>Shares of First Republic Bank, based in San Francisco, and Signature Bank in New York were down more than 20 per cent on Friday. But <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/wall-street-drops-as-silicon-valley-bank-seized-by-regulators-20230311-p5cr8w\" target=\"_blank\">shares of some of the nation’s largest banks including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup</a>, nudged higher on Friday after a slump on Thursday.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/business/svb-silicon-valley-bank-explainer.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong>New York: </strong>The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the first pill for postnatal depression, a milestone considered likely to increase recognition and treatment of a debilitating condition that afflicts about half a million women in the United States alone every year.</p> <p>Clinical trial data show the pill works quickly, beginning to ease depression in as little as three days, significantly faster than general antidepressants, which can take two weeks or longer to have an effect. That – along with the fact that it is taken for just two weeks, not for months – may encourage more patients to accept treatment, maternal mental health experts said.</p> <p>The most significant aspect of the approval may not be the features of the drug, but that it is explicitly designated for postpartum depression. Several doctors and other experts said that while there were other antidepressants that were effective in treating the condition, the availability of one specifically shown to address it could help reduce the stigma of postpartum depression by underscoring that it has biological underpinnings and is not something women should blame themselves for.</p> <p>The hope is that it will encourage more women to seek help and prompt more obstetricians and family doctors to screen for symptoms and suggest counselling or treatment.</p> <p>“This is a patient population that just so often falls through the cracks,” said Dr Ruta Nunacs, a psychiatrist with the Centre for Women’s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. “When women are told, ‘You have postpartum depression’, it’s embarrassing, it is demeaning, it makes them feel like a bad mum.”</p> <p>She added: “There’s also a lot of stigma about taking antidepressant medication, so that might make this treatment more appealing because it’s really a treatment specific for postpartum depression.”</p> <p>An estimated 10 per cent to 15 per cent of women who give birth in the United States experience depression during pregnancy or in the year afterwards. The condition can be accompanied by intense anxiety, shame, guilt, impaired sleep, panic attacks and suicidal thoughts or attempts. And it can make it difficult for mothers to provide their babies with the care, bonding and nurturing that is crucial for healthy development.</p> <p>The pill, zuranolone, which will be marketed under the brand name Zurzuvae, was developed by Sage Therapeutics, a Massachusetts company that produces it in partnership with Biogen. It is expected to be available in the US after the Drug Enforcement Administration completes a 90-day review required for drugs affecting the central nervous system, Sage said. The companies have not announced a price for the pill.</p> <p>The only other drug approved for postpartum depression is brexanolone, also developed by Sage and marketed as Zulresso. But brexanolone, approved in 2019, requires a 60-hour intravenous infusion in a hospital, carries risks of loss of consciousness and costs $US34,000 ($51,000). Sage says only about 1000 patients have received it so far.</p> <p>Taking a pill for two weeks is much easier, not requiring a mother to leave her baby for several days. However, the FDA did require the label to include warnings about possible suicidal thoughts and behaviour, sleepiness and confusion.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/health/postpartum-depression-pill-fda.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><em>London</em> | Hundreds of thousands of people marched through central London in a huge <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/middle-east/israel-is-winning-the-battle-against-hamas-but-losing-the-pr-war-20231101-p5egoi\" target=\"_blank\">pro-Palestinian demonstration</a> on Saturday (Sunday AEDT), a tense day in which police battled with a small right-wing group to keep order on some city streets.</p> <p>The large march in support of the Palestinian cause coincided with Armistice Day, when Britain commemorates those who fought in World War I and subsequent conflicts, and followed days of debate about whether the protest should be allowed to go ahead.</p> <p>A spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police Service said an estimated 300,000 people had attended the pro-Palestinian March, making it one of the largest protests in Britain in recent years. The police also said that no incidents had arisen from it, but 82 counter-protesters had been arrested.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, a right-wing group clashed with police near the Cenotaph, a war memorial close to the prime minister’s official residence, shortly after a two-minute silence was held to mark Remembrance Day. Videos showed some of them bursting through a cordoned-off area.</p> <p>Tensions were running high over the march after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who is responsible for policing in the country, argued that its timing was “provocative and disrespectful”. Ms Braverman called for the march to be banned and caused a political furor by writing an opinion article – which Mr Sunak disowned – that accused police of bias over their handling of protests.</p> <p>On Saturday evening, Mr Sunak made it clear that he condemned both the violence of far-right groups and statements of fringe groups that he said were antisemitic or had shown sympathy for Hamas.</p> <p>“The despicable actions of a minority of people undermine those who have chosen to express their views peacefully,” he said in a statement. He said he planned to meet with London’s top police official in the coming days.</p> <p>“What we have seen today does not defend the honour of our armed forces, but utterly disrespects them,” he said, acknowledging the weekend’s Armistice Day events. That is true he said, for far-right “thugs attacking police officers and trespassing on the Cenotaph, and it is true for those singing antisemitic chants and brandishing pro-Hamas signs and clothing on today’s protest”.</p> <p>On the past several Saturdays, tens of thousands of people have marched in London to denounce the <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/asia/g7-foreign-ministers-demand-emergency-action-in-gaza-20231108-p5eifl\" target=\"_blank\">rising civilian death toll in the Gaza Strip</a> as Israel has bombarded the territory in response to the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on Israel.</p> <p>People travelled by bus and train from around the country to attend the latest march, which began at Hyde Park in central London and made its way to the US Embassy about four kilometres away on the south bank of the Thames River. As the event got under way, people in the park waved large Palestinian flags in the bright sunshine and carried placards reading “End the siege” and “Ceasefire now”.</p> <p>Demonstrators represented a broad cross-section of the population: families with babies in strollers, teenagers chatting and laughing with flags draped over their shoulders, an older man who walked slowly but joined the mass of people as it progressed down the park’s main avenue.</p> <p>Mary Robertson, 39, had come from her home in South London with her partner and two-year-old daughter. “We want to show Palestinians that we see what’s happening to them,” she said, carrying her daughter while her partner pushed a stroller decorated with a sign reading, “Armistice in Gaza Now”.</p> <p>“What’s happening in Gaza is so shocking – nothing feels OK if you’re not doing something,” Ms Robertson added.</p> <p>The mood was calm and cheerful, although a helicopter hovered overhead and police officers were scattered on the edges of the crowd and in nearby subway stations. Every so often, someone would lead a chant of, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, although not everyone joined in.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Police Service said that about 2000 officers were on duty across central London throughout the weekend, double the usual number, as officials feared that violent elements, including from the far right, would surface on the fringes of the march.</p> <p>The police force also said that it would rely on “an extensive set of powers”, including setting up exclusion zones around key memorials and using additional search and arrest abilities, to protect the city from anyone “intent on inciting hate, violence and disorder”.</p> <p>Tommy Robinson, an anti-Islam agitator, was in London on Saturday and urged supporters to take to the streets, calling for an “uncontrollable mass of men who are willing to stand for their country”. Robinson had been barred from posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, but has since been reinstated to the platform.</p> <p>Police had allowed the main march to proceed despite resistance from some political circles.</p> <p>Under British law, police can apply for a ban if there is a risk of serious public disorder, but Britain’s most senior police officer said that threshold had not been met in this case.</p> <p>Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, one of the British groups that has organised the weekly rallies, called Ms Braverman’s language “reckless” and “deeply irresponsible”. Mr Jamal, who is of Palestinian and British descent, said the group had been in touch with police since the earliest demonstration because of the number of protesters involved, “and we need to know we can do that safely”.</p> <p>After the counter-protesters’ scuffles with police on Saturday, some politicians and commentators denounced Ms Braverman’s statements as divisive. Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, called for the home secretary’s resignation, saying on X that her position was “untenable”.</p> <p>Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, wrote on the same platform that “the scenes of disorder we witnessed by the far-right at the Cenotaph are a direct result of the home secretary’s words,” adding: “The police’s job has been made much harder.”</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/world/europe/uk-israel-palestinian-protest.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'JPMorgan to pay $430m in settlement with Epstein’s victims',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>JPMorgan Chase reached a tentative settlement with sexual abuse victims of Jeffrey Epstein, the deceased financier, after weeks of embarrassing disclosures about <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/jpmorgan-urged-to-cut-ties-with-epstein-back-in-2006-20230413-p5d045\" target=\"_blank\">the bank’s longstanding relationship with him</a>, the bank and lawyers for the victims said in a statement on Monday (Tuesday AEST).</p> <p>David Boies, one of the lead lawyers for the victims, said the bank was prepared to pay $US290 million ($430 million) to resolve the lawsuit. The parties initially had agreed not to disclose the settlement amount in their joint statement, as it was set to be included in a court filing within the next week.</p> <p>The proposed deal would settle a lawsuit filed last November in Manhattan federal court by an unidentified woman on behalf of victims who were sexually abused by Epstein over a roughly 15-year period when they were teenage girls and young women, the suit said. The number of victims could potentially rise to more than 100.</p> <p>In the statement, the bank and the lawyers for the victims said they had reached “an agreement in principle to settle” the lawsuit on behalf of the victims and the “settlement is in the best interests of all parties, especially the survivors who were the victims of Epstein’s terrible abuse”.</p> <p>The settlement agreement was reached roughly two weeks after Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive and one of Wall Street’s best-known bankers, sat for <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/dimon-faces-two-day-deposition-in-jpmorgan-epstein-lawsuits-20230419-p5d1hr\" target=\"_blank\">a daylong deposition</a> in which he said he had barely heard of Epstein before the financier’s July 2019 arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.</p> <p>Epstein killed himself in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell a month after his arrest.</p> <p>JPMorgan still faces a related lawsuit by the government of the US Virgin Islands. That suit remains the biggest outstanding Epstein-related case after years of lawsuits against Epstein’s estate and Ghislaine Maxwell’s conviction in 2021 in Manhattan federal court for helping Epstein engage in sex trafficking.</p> <p>The lawsuit filed by the victims claimed that JPMorgan ignored repeated warnings that Epstein had been trafficking teenage girls and young women for sex, even after he registered as a sex offender and pleaded guilty in a 2008 Florida case to soliciting prostitution from a teenage girl. The complaint said the bank overlooked red flags in Epstein’s activity because it valued him as a wealthy client who had access to dozens of even wealthier people.</p> <p>Court documents and deposition testimony reviewed by <em>The New York Times</em> revealed that bank employees had filed numerous suspicious activity reports about Epstein’s repeated large cash withdrawals.</p> <p>The legal documents revealed that after designating Epstein a “high risk client” in 2006, <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/jpmorgan-urged-to-cut-ties-with-epstein-back-in-2006-20230413-p5d045\" target=\"_blank\">the bank kept him on as a customer</a> despite media reports detailing allegations of his sexual abuse of teenage girls and evidence that some of the cash withdrawals were for payments to dozens of young women.</p> <p>JPMorgan had provided banking services for Epstein from roughly 1998 to 2013 — a period in which the federal authorities and victims have said some of the worst conduct was committed by the financier, who had palatial homes in Manhattan, Florida, the US Virgin Islands, New Mexico and Paris.</p> <p>The bank reiterated on Monday what it had said a number of times before about how Epstein committed “heinous crimes” and “any association with him was a mistake and we regret it”.</p> <p>The same lawyers for Epstein’s victims last month negotiated <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/jeffrey-epstein-accusers-sue-jpmorgan-deutsche-bank-20221125-p5c17g\" target=\"_blank\">a tentative $US75 million settlement with Deutsche Bank</a>, which succeeded JPMorgan as Epstein’s primary banker. Deutsche, which ended its relationship with Epstein in late 2018, paid a $US150 million fine to New York regulators in 2020 over allegations that it failed to police its financial dealings with the disgraced financier sufficiently, among other compliance failures.</p> <p>The settlements with both banks must be approved by Judge Jed Rakoff of US District Court in Manhattan. Rakoff is also presiding over the related lawsuit by the government of the US Virgin Islands.</p> <p>The Virgin Islands, the US territory in the Caribbean, contends that JPMorgan should pay it damages for enabling Epstein to set up a sex trafficking operation on his private island residence off St. Thomas. But JPMorgan, in court papers, has bitterly opposed the lawsuit, arguing that government officials there cosied up to Epstein for nearly two decades.</p> <p>Two of Epstein’s businesses received lucrative tax breaks from the US territory worth tens of millions of dollars. Shortly after JPMorgan ended its relationship with Epstein, the Virgin Islands approved a first-of-its-kind boutique banking license for Epstein.</p> <p>Rakoff had put the lawsuits against JPMorgan on a fast track, with more than a dozen depositions given over the past three months, including the one from Dimon and another from Albert Bryan jnr, the governor of the Virgin Islands.</p> <p>The deal between JPMorgan and Epstein’s victims was hammered out as some of the plaintiffs’ lawyers were taking the deposition of <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/ex-barclays-boss-in-epstein-island-hot-tub-20230217-p5cl9k\" target=\"_blank\">James E. Staley</a>, the former JPMorgan executive who had close ties to Epstein.</p> <p>In court filings, the Virgin Islands claimed Epstein and Staley shared sexually suggestive emails about young women.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.afr.com/rear-window/westpac-chair-john-mcfarlane-cooling-on-jes-staley-20230221-p5cmav\" target=\"_blank\">Staley, better known as Jes</a>, has in court papers repeatedly denied doing anything wrong or being aware that Epstein had sexually abused young women and teenage girls. JPMorgan then sued Staley seeking to ensure that, if it is determined that he did engage in improper activity, he can be held liable for damages the bank ends up paying.</p> <p>The victims’ lawyers who were most involved in litigating and negotiating the proposed settlements with the two banks included Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Brad Edwards and Brittany Henderson.</p> <p>Boies said of the proposed settlement with JPMorgan, “It has taken a long time, too long, but today is a great day for Jeffrey Epstein survivors”. Edwards said the deal goes along way to bringing “full justice” to Epstein’s many victims.</p> <p>“The settlements signal that financial institutions have an important role to play in spotting and shutting down sex trafficking,” said McCawley, who argued before Rakoff that the JPMorgan lawsuit should be treated as a class-action suit Rakoff approved the class-action status in a ruling on Monday.</p> <p>In court papers associated with the proposed settlement with Deutsche Bank, the victims’ lawyers said they expected to seek fees of up to 30 per cent. The lawyers are likely to submit a similar fee request in the JPMorgan litigation. Any fee request must be approved by Rakoff.</p> <p>In the Deutsche settlement, the victims will each be entitled to receive anywhere from $US75,000 to $US5 million in restitution, according to court filings.</p> <p>The settlements with the two banks will add to the total relief that the many victims of Epstein have received in recent years. Epstein’s estate has paid out about $US150 million in restitution to more than 125 victims — many of whom may be eligible to apply for additional compensation from the deals with Deutsche and JPMorgan.</p> <p>The Virgin Islands, which last year secured a $US105 million settlement from Epstein’s estate, said in a statement that it would “continue to proceed with its enforcement action to ensure full accountability for JPMorgan’s violations of law”.</p> <p>And on Monday, the Virgin Islands filed a new round of court papers that included emails from JPMorgan employees, in which several argued as far back as 2008 that he should not be retained as customer.</p> <p>In July 2011, Stephen Cutler, the bank’s general counsel at the time, wrote an email to Staley and others at JPMorgan: “<a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/jpmorgan-urged-to-cut-ties-with-epstein-back-in-2006-20230413-p5d045\" target=\"_blank\">This is not an honourable person in any way.

       "   'description': '<p><em>On the front lines, southern Ukraine</em> | They have NATO equipment and Western training. Some have English-speaking commanders, unusual in the Ukrainian military, and even an American-accented, evangelical chaplain.</p> <p>“I am never tired, I’m in the Ukrainian marines,” joked Oleksandr, 28, a battalion commander of the 37th Marine Brigade. Sitting down in the shade outside a cottage near the front line, he was determinedly positive. “I think it’s going well.”</p> <p>Over the past several months, nine Ukrainian brigades, 36,000 troops in all, have received four to six weeks of training in combined arms combat, a synchronised way of fighting that some thought would enable them to spearhead another rout of the Russian military, as in Kharkiv last year.</p> <p>But some brigades suffered heavy losses in the <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/europe/ukraine-hits-russian-oil-tanker-as-sea-battle-intensifies-20230806-p5du7l\" target=\"_blank\">initial stages of this counteroffensive</a>, struggling to advance against the formidable Russian defences. At least one new brigade was so badly debilitated from casualties that it was withdrawn from the battlefield to rebuild.</p> <p>Most of the fighting has been hidden from the view of the news media since the start of operations in early June. But reporters from <em>The New York Times</em> were permitted to visit several marine brigades – two of them newly formed brigades – that are operating on one part of the southern front, to hear from the troops themselves.</p> <p>Ukraine’s new brigades, trained and equipped according to NATO standards, have a different look and feel from many other Ukrainian units. These marines now carry American M4 assault rifles and drive Humvees, which they repainted, changing the desert brown of the vehicles so often seen in Afghanistan and Iraq to a deep green for better cover in Ukraine’s lush countryside.</p> <p>“I did not expect we would switch to NATO weapons so soon,” said Ukrop, 23, a company commander in the 38th Marine Brigade who, like all the marines interviewed for this article, gave only first names or call signs, in keeping with military protocol.</p> <h2>Fresh recruits</h2> <p>He watched as men from his unit loaded two laser-guided rockets into a launcher on the back of a Humvee for a firing mission. “It’s a great new system, and we have new vehicles too,” he added.</p> <p>The new brigades are made up of recruits, fresh from basic training after they were called up or volunteered to join the military this year. Their commanders are mostly experienced fighters, and some, like Oleksandr, a lieutenant colonel, who has completed officer training in the United States, are career officers.</p> <p>They all have a strong sense of urgency – “We have to do this fast,” one said – but they also warned that the fight would be long and hard.</p> <p>“A lot of people thought it would be very fast and in the autumn we would be in Crimea,” said Oleksandr, the battalion commander. “But every metre of the tree line is very difficult.”</p> <p>“It’s not a sprint,” he added. “It’s a marathon.”</p> <p>The Ukrainian military does not release numbers of dead and wounded, but Oleksandr acknowledged that his brigade had taken heavy casualties in the first days of the counteroffensive in June, when his troops ran into minefields and came under an <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/europe/arrest-in-russian-plot-to-kill-zelensky-20230808-p5duow\" target=\"_blank\">onslaught of Russian</a> artillery and airstrikes.</p> <p>“I lost a lot,” he said, “and some of the new guys are mentally broken.” As for the destruction of tanks and armoured vehicles, he shrugged it off as a normal consequence of war.</p> <p>The heavy losses were not a shock to them. Most of the commanders said that they had seen units, including their own, decimated at times during the past 16 months of fighting. Oleksandr said casualties were so high during the counteroffensive in Kherson last year that he had been forced to replace the members of his unit three times.</p> <p>While the Ukrainian military was training the new brigades and obtaining new equipment, the Russian forces had months to prepare a layered defence, digging in and laying extensive minefields. They also had the advantage of greater artillery fire and troop numbers, Oleksandr said.</p> <h2>Further training</h2> <p>The marines said they were grateful for the various Western armoured vehicles, which they said saved lives and were superior to the outdated Soviet-era tanks and armoured vehicles that they had been using.</p> <p>But above all, commanders were taking care to give further training to new recruits and making sure that they were mixed in with more experienced marines for operations.</p> <p>“You cannot be completely prepared for combat however much you train,” said Shturval, 52, who was overseeing training for a group of recruits brought in to make up for recent losses in the 35th Marine Brigade. “In the first fight, they go in with our veterans, and after two or three battles they are veterans themselves.”</p> <p>Planning and reconnaissance was the key, said Prophet, 22, a company commander from the 38th brigade who had just led a successful assault, seizing control of three tree lines in a combined operation on the southern front.</p> <p>“Bit by bit, we will find a place where the seam will split open,” said his deputy brigade commander, a lieutenant colonel who uses the call sign Consul. “Water cuts through stone, and we’ll do the same, bit by bit. At first it is a small stream and then it turns into a river.”</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/07/world/europe/ukraine-marines-counteroffensive.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>Among the many unique experiences of reporting on artificial intelligence is this: In a young industry flooded with hype and money, person after person tells me that they are desperate to be regulated, even if it slows them down. In fact, especially if it slows them down.</p> <p>What they tell me is obvious to anyone watching. Competition is forcing them to go too fast and cut too many corners. This technology is too important to be left to a race among Microsoft, Google, Meta and a few other firms. But no company can slow down to a safe pace without risking irrelevancy. That’s where the government comes in — or so they hope.</p> <p>A place to start is with the frameworks policymakers have already put forward to govern AI. The two major proposals, at least in the West, are the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which the White House put forward in 2022, and the Artificial Intelligence Act, which the European Commission proposed in 2021. Then, last week, China released its latest regulatory approach.</p> <h2>The EU approach</h2> <p>Let’s start with the European proposal, as it came first. The AIA tries to regulate AI systems according to how they’re used. It is particularly concerned with high-risk uses, which include everything from overseeing critical infrastructure to grading papers to calculating credit scores to making hiring decisions. High-risk uses, in other words, are any use in which a person’s life or livelihood might depend on a decision made by a machine-learning algorithm.</p> <p>The European Commission described this approach as “future-proof,” which proved to be predictably arrogant, as new AI systems have already thrown the bill’s clean definitions into chaos. Focusing on use cases is fine for narrow systems designed for a specific use, but it’s a category error when it’s applied to generalised systems. Models such as GPT-4 don’t do any one thing except predict the next word in a sequence. You can use them to write code, pass the bar exam, draw up contracts, create political campaigns, plot market strategy, and power AI companions or sexbots. In trying to regulate systems by use case, the AIA ends up saying very little about how to regulate the underlying model that’s powering all these use cases.</p> <p>Unintended consequences abound. The AIA mandates, for example, that in high-risk cases, “training, validation and testing data sets shall be relevant, representative, free of errors and complete.” But what the large language models are showing is that the most powerful systems are those trained on the largest data sets. Those sets can’t plausibly be free of error, and it’s not clear what it would mean for them to be “representative.” There’s a strong case to be made for data transparency, but I don’t think Europe intends to deploy weaker, less capable systems across everything from exam grading to infrastructure.</p> <p>The other problem with the use-case approach is that it treats AI as a technology that will, itself, respect boundaries. But its disrespect for boundaries is what most worries the people working on these systems. Imagine that “personal assistant” is rated as a low-risk use case and a hypothetical GPT-6 is deployed to power an absolutely fabulous personal assistant. The system gets tuned to be extremely good at interacting with humans and accomplishing a diverse set of goals in the real world. That’s great until someone asks it to secure a restaurant reservation at the hottest place in town and the system decides that the only way to do it is to cause a disruption that leads one-third of that night’s diners to cancel their bookings.</p> <p>Sounds like sci-fi? Sorry, but this kind of problem is sci-fact.</p> <p>Anyone training these systems has watched them come up with solutions to problems that humans would never consider, and for good reason. OpenAI, for instance, trained a system to play the boat-racing game CoastRunners, and built in positive reinforcement for racking up a high score. It was assumed that would give the system an incentive to finish the race. But the system instead discovered “an isolated lagoon where it can turn in a large circle and repeatedly knock over three targets, timing its movement so as to always knock over the targets just as they repopulate.” Choosing this strategy meant “repeatedly catching on fire, crashing into other boats and going the wrong way on the track,” but it also meant the highest scores, so that’s what the model did.</p> <p>This is an example of “alignment risk,” the danger that what we want the systems to do and what they will actually do could diverge, and perhaps do so violently. Curbing alignment risk requires curbing the systems themselves, not just the ways we permit people to use them.</p> <h2>The US blueprint</h2> <p>The White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is a more interesting proposal. But where the European Commission’s approach is much too tailored, the White House blueprint may well be too broad. No AI system today comes close to adhering to the framework, and it’s not clear that any of them could.</p> <p>“Automated systems should provide explanations that are technically valid, meaningful and useful to you and to any operators or others who need to understand the system, and calibrated to the level of risk based on the context,” the blueprint says. Love it. But every expert I talk to says basically the same thing: We have made no progress on interpretability, and while there is certainly a chance we will, it is only a chance. For now, we have no idea what is happening inside these prediction systems. Force them to provide an explanation, and the one they give is itself a prediction of what we want to hear — it’s turtles all the way down.</p> <p>The blueprint says that “automated systems should be developed with consultation from diverse communities, stakeholders and domain experts to identify concerns, risks and potential impacts of the system.” This is crucial, and it would be interesting to see the White House or Congress flesh out how much consultation is needed, what type is sufficient and how regulators will make sure the public’s wishes are actually followed.</p> <p>It goes on to insist that “systems should undergo predeployment testing, risk identification and mitigation, and ongoing monitoring that demonstrate they are safe and effective based on their intended use.” This, too, is essential, but we do not understand these systems well enough to test and audit them effectively. OpenAI would certainly prefer that users didn’t keep jail-breaking GPT-4 to get it to ignore the company’s constraints, but the company has not been able to design a testing regime capable of coming anywhere close to that.</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting of the blueprint’s proposals is that “you should be able to opt out from automated systems in favour of a human alternative, where appropriate.” In that sentence, the devil lurks in the definition of “appropriate.” But the underlying principle is worth considering. Should there be an opt-out from AI systems? Which ones? When is an opt-out clause a genuine choice, and at what point does it become merely an invitation to recede from society altogether, like saying you can choose not to use the internet or vehicular transport or banking services if you so choose.</p> <h2>The Chinese rules</h2> <p>Then there are China’s proposed new rules. I won’t say much on these, except to note that they are much more restrictive than anything the United States or Europe is imagining, which makes me very sceptical of arguments that we are in a race with China to develop advanced artificial intelligence. China seems perfectly willing to cripple the development of general AI so it can concentrate on systems that will more reliably serve state interests.</p> <p>China insists, for example, that “content generated through the use of generative AI shall reflect the Socialist Core Values, and may not contain: subversion of state power; overturning of the socialist system; incitement of separatism; harm to national unity; propagation of terrorism or extremism; propagation of ethnic hatred or ethnic discrimination; violent, obscene or sexual information; false information; as well as content that may upset economic order or social order.”</p> <p>If China means what it says, its AI sector has its work cut out for it. AI is advancing so quickly in the United States precisely because we’re allowing unpredictable systems to proliferate. Predictable AI is, for now, weaker AI.</p> <p>I wouldn’t go as far as China is going with AI regulation. But we need to go a lot further than we have — and fast, before these systems get too many users and companies get addicted to profits and start beating back regulators. I’m glad to see that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, is launching an initiative on AI regulation. And I won’t pretend to know exactly what he and his colleagues should do.</p> <h2>Five priorities to consider</h2> <p>After talking to a lot of people working on these problems and reading through a lot of policy papers imagining solutions, there are a few categories I’d prioritise.</p> <p>The first is the question — and it is a question — of interpretability. As I said above, it’s not clear that interpretability is achievable. But without it, we will be turning more and more of our society over to algorithms we do not understand. If you told me you were building a next generation nuclear power plant, but there was no way to get accurate readings on whether the reactor core was going to blow up, I’d say you shouldn’t build it. Is AI like that power plant? I’m not sure. But that’s a question society should consider, not a question that should be decided by a few hundred technologists. At the very least, I think it’s worth insisting that AI companies spend a good bit more time and money discovering whether this problem is solvable.</p> <p>The second is security. For all the talk of an AI race with China, the easiest way for China — or any country for that matter, or even any hacker collective — to catch up on AI is to simply steal the work being done here. Any firm building AI systems above a certain scale should be operating with hardened cybersecurity. It’s ridiculous to block the export of advanced semiconductors to China but to simply hope that every 26-year-old engineer at OpenAI is following appropriate security measures.</p> <p>The third is evaluations and audits. This is how models will be evaluated for everything from bias to the ability to scam people to the tendency to replicate themselves across the internet.</p> <p>Right now, the testing done to make sure large models are safe is voluntary, opaque and inconsistent. No best practices have been accepted across the industry, and not nearly enough work has been done to build testing regimes in which the public can have confidence. That needs to change — and fast. Airplanes rarely crash because the Federal Aviation Administration is excellent at its job. The Food and Drug Administration is arguably too rigorous in its assessments of new drugs and devices, but it is very good at keeping unsafe products off the market. The government needs to do more here than just write up some standards. It needs to make investments and build institutions to conduct the monitoring.</p> <p>The fourth is liability. There’s going to be a temptation to treat AI systems the way we treat social media platforms and exempt the companies that build them from the harms caused by those who use them. I believe that would be a mistake. The way to make AI systems safe is to give the companies that design the models a good reason to make them safe. Making them bear at least some liability for what their models do would encourage a lot more caution.</p> <p>The fifth is, for lack of a better term, humanness. Do we want a world filled with AI systems that are designed to seem human in their interactions with humans? Because make no mistake: That is a design decision, not an emergent property of machine-learning code. AI systems can be tuned to return dull and caveat-filled answers, or they can be built to show off sparkling personalities and become enmeshed in the emotional lives of human beings.</p> <p>I think the latter class of programs has the potential to do a lot of good as well as a lot of harm, so the conditions under which they operate should be thought through carefully. It might, for instance, make sense to place fairly tight limits on the kinds of personalities that can be built for AI systems that interact with children. I’d also like to see very tight limits on any ability to make money by using AI companions to manipulate consumer behaviour.</p> <p>This is not meant to be an exhaustive list. Others will have different priorities and different views. And the good news is that new proposals are being released almost daily. The Future of Life Institute’s policy recommendations are strong, and I think the AI Objectives Institute’s focus on the human-run institutions that will design and own AI systems is critical. But one thing regulators shouldn’t fear is imperfect rules that slow a young industry. For once, much of that industry is desperate for someone to help slow it down.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/opinion/this-is-too-important-to-leave-to-microsoft-google-and-facebook.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Teens face trial accused of aiding beheading of teacher Samuel Paty',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><strong>Paris:</strong> Six teenagers have gone on trial in Paris over accusations they were connected to the killing of Samuel Paty, a history teacher whose beheading by an Islamic extremist in 2020 inflicted lasting trauma on France.</p> <p>Most of the defendants, former middle-school students at the school where Paty taught, are accused of helping the killer identify and track the teacher, although they are not believed to have known that he intended to kill.</p> <p>Officials have not publicly identified the defendants, and they are being tried behind closed doors at a criminal court for minors in Paris. They face up to 2½ years in prison.</p> <p>A separate trial for eight adults who have been charged in the case is expected to be held next year.</p> <p>Paty, 47, had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad to a civics class to illustrate free speech and was subsequently beheaded because of the act on October 16, 2020, near the school where he worked in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, a north-western suburb of Paris. The assailant, Abdoullakh Anzorov, an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen descent, was shot and killed by police later that day.</p> <p>Paty’s killing deeply shocked France, where teachers play a crucial role in imparting the French Republic’s values of liberty, equality, fraternity and secularism. Teachers such as Paty are seen as the first line of defence of a public, secular school system that many fear is increasingly under threat from Islamic extremism.</p> <p>Last month, almost three years to the day after Paty’s killing, another teacher, Dominique Bernard, 57, who taught French literature, was killed at his school in northern France in ominously similar circumstances. The suspect in that case is a former student at the school, a 20-year-old Russian immigrant who prosecutors say pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group before going on a stabbing spree in which he also injured three other people.</p> <p>The teenagers’ trial will run until December 8. It is closed to the media, and reporters are legally barred from disclosing the identity of the defendants or from giving accounts of the proceedings.</p> <p>Prosecutors have accused five of the defendants, who were 14 and 15 at the time of the killing, of helping Anzorov identify and track Paty, including by keeping watch outside their school, by telling Anzorov what he looked like, and by pointing him out as he left school. The teenagers have been charged with criminal conspiracy to prepare a violent assault.</p> <p>Lawyers for the defendants have argued that their clients are consumed by guilt over the teacher’s death and that they did not know at the time that Anzorov intended to kill Paty. Anzorov had stalked Paty’s school the day of the killing and had enlisted the teenagers’ help in exchange for about $500, telling them he wanted to confront the teacher and force him to apologise.</p> <p>Antoine Ory, a lawyer for one of the teenage defendants, said at the courthouse that his client “has been gripped by remorse for the past three years”.</p> <p>The sixth defendant, a girl who was 13 at the time of the killing, has been charged with making false allegations against Paty.</p> <p>Paty, who taught civics, had shown the students caricatures published by satirical magazine <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> – itself the target of a massacre in 2015 – to illustrate the right to blasphemy, free speech and freedom of conscience.</p> <p>Prosecutors have said the girl told her parents that Paty had singled out Muslim students in the classroom, asking them to leave before he showed the caricatures. In reality, the girl had not attended that class and Paty had not ordered Muslim students to exit.</p> <p>The girl, who had been given a two-day suspension from school for unrelated reasons, told her parents instead that she had been punished for complaining to Paty about the caricatures.</p> <p>But the girl’s false account, prosecutors have said, set off a tragic chain reaction. Her father, Brahim Chnina, spread the claims on social media. When Anzorov, who lived nearly 100 kilometres away, learned of the controversy, he then set out to kill Paty. Prosecutors said at the time that he contacted Chnina repeatedly.</p> <p>Louis Cailliez, a lawyer for one of Paty’s sisters, told reporters at the courthouse Monday that he hoped the trial would determine the teenagers’ level of responsibility in what he called “a fatal combination of small cowardice and big lies.”</p> <p>Chnina and Abdelhakim Sefrioui, an Islamic activist who filmed online videos calling Paty an anti-Muslim “thug” and demanding that he be fired, are among six adults scheduled to face trial at a later date on charges of organising a criminal terrorist conspiracy.</p> <p>Two other adults, friends of Anzorov who are accused of helping him buy weapons and driving him to the school, have been charged with complicity in the killing.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/world/europe/france-teacher-killing-trial.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><em>Tel Aviv</em> | Hamas’ attack on Saturday took Israeli intelligence officials by surprise, particularly the methods the militants used to enter and leave Israel, according to a senior defence official familiar with the information collected about the group.</p> <p>The broad attack, mostly successful from Hamas’ point of view, revealed some significant failures by the Israeli defence establishment. It also may change Israel’s overall strategic approach to Hamas and the Gaza Strip, said the official, who asked not to be identified when discussing security matters.</p> <p>And that could have a far-reaching effect on the entire Middle East.</p> <p>Until now, Israel has contained Hamas and Gaza with a strategy that hinged on an intelligence network that would warn against Hamas’ moves, and on the power of the Israeli army to repel a ground invasion by Hamas. In the Hamas attack on Saturday, these two safeguards failed.</p> <p>Israel is traditionally perceived as the strongest intelligence power in the region, with extensive coverage of the Gaza Strip. And in recent months, Israeli intelligence did repeatedly warn that a military conflict could flare up because Iran and affiliated militias have perceived Israel as weakened by the nation’s profound divisions over the judicial overhaul being pursued by the ultra-right governing coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to four senior defence officials.</p> <p>Still, while Israeli intelligence collected some indications that Hamas was planning a major operation, they were far from forming a clear picture, one of the officials added.</p> <p>Israel, the official said, did not pick up on the elaborate preparations that were likely needed for the 250 Hamas militants tasked to lead the assault, and target military bases, cities and kibbutzes.</p> <p>US officials, too, said that both Israel and the United States had known a Hamas attack at some point was possible, or even likely. But they said there was no specific tactical warning of the strikes Saturday, no sign that would have allowed Israel to take specific measures.</p> <p>Many questioned why Israel and the United States were blindsided. Mick Mulroy, a former CIA officer and senior Pentagon official, said the complexity of the attack by Hamas indicates it would have required much preparation.</p> <p>“There were likely indications of the buildup of munitions and the preparation of the assault force, and there was cyber activity in Israel prior to the assault,” Mr Mulroy said.</p> <p>Since the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005, Hamas has transformed from a militant organisation to the leader of a territory with many characteristics of a state. The group has started rounds of fighting with Israel every few years, which usually have not lasted more than a week. These attacks include firing rockets on Israeli cities and trying to kidnap or kill Israelis. But nothing has been as extensive as the Saturday attack.</p> <p>For its part, Israel in past years has responded with its enormous firepower, usually from aircraft, against targets in Gaza and has tried to assassinate the organisation’s senior officials. But it has launched very limited ground manoeuvres.</p> <p>The Israeli strategy has been to contain the fighting against militants in the Gaza Strip, as long as Israel’s fatalities were not too high, which might oblige it to engage in an all-out ground invasion.</p> <p>Four successive Israeli prime ministers decided that the price of invading and occupying the Gaza Strip to crush Hamas rule would be too high, in the lives of Israeli soldiers and Palestinians, and that the toll of governing millions of residents there would be too costly.</p> <p>Israel continued to act this way even though it knew that both Hamas and Palestinian Jihad have received funding, training, weapons and advanced combat and intelligence gear from Iran, three officials said, and that the militant groups were becoming stronger.</p> <p>The surprise attack on Israel came almost 50 years to the day to the start of the Yom Kippur War, which began with a surprise attack by Syrian tank columns and Egyptian brigades. That made it even more surprising that Israel was not more on guard.</p> <p>The defence official said this was likely not a coincidence but a careful choice by Hamas to pick a date perceived as a national trauma. The intelligence surprise, as well as Hamas’ ability to cross the border and cause heavy losses, is <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/americas-harsh-lessons-from-the-1970s-oil-shock-20160718-gq7wh1\" target=\"_blank\">strikingly reminiscent of the 1973 war</a>.</p> <p>The videos Hamas took during the operation and which were immediately distributed on social media presented the Israeli defence establishment as weak, surprised and humiliated.</p> <p>Israel is now likely to respond with force, and possibly with a ground invasion of Gaza, in the belief that Hamas did not leave it any choice, a senior defence official said.</p> <p>One key question, which will determine how the crisis unfolds, is whether Hezbollah, the Lebanese military group, stays on the sidelines or if it activates its fighters to attack Israel. If Hezbollah becomes directly involved in the fighting it is likely to become some of the most intense in the region in years.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/israels-defense-failures-may-change-strategy-toward-hamas-and-gaza.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><em>Washington</em> | President Joe Biden told Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT) that there was room for discussion about addressing the US deficit, as he insisted that Congress would have to pass a debt-limit increase with no strings attached to avoid a financial cataclysm.</p> <p>Mr Biden and Mr McCarthy met at the White House for more than an hour <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/biden-mccarthy-to-meet-on-debt-ceiling-20230130-p5cgha\" target=\"_blank\">in a discussion that carried high stakes</a>, with the federal government set to exhaust its ability to pay its bills on time as early as June.</p> <p>Republicans have refused to raise the statutory debt limit unless Mr Biden accepts deep cuts in federal spending. The president has said repeatedly that he expects Congress to raise the borrowing cap with no conditions – and that he will not negotiate conditions for an increase.</p> <p>After the meeting, the White House said Mr Biden repeated to Mr McCarthy that he would not negotiate on the limit. But the president did say he welcomes a “separate discussion with congressional leaders about how to reduce the deficit and control the national debt while continuing to grow the economy,” a White House summary of the meeting said.</p> <p>The statement signalled that Mr Biden was open to a parallel discussion on tax and spending issues with Mr McCarthy, even as he stood firm that Congress would have to pass a clean debt-ceiling increase to avert a crisis that could tip the country into recession.</p> <p>McCarthy emerged from the meeting without tangible signs of progress, but he expressed some glimmers of optimism.</p> <p>“No agreements, no promises,” he said. “Except we will continue this conversation.”</p> <p>The federal government has run a budget deficit every year since 2000, forcing it to borrow money and add to a national debt that now sits at $US31.4 trillion ($44 trillion).</p> <p>The meeting teed up what could be a long and potentially unwieldy stretch of negotiations for Mr McCarthy, who is grappling with a razor-thin majority and a conference of lawmakers who have chafed at raising the debt ceiling and resisted federal spending at nearly all levels.</p> <p>Mr Biden, too, is feeling pressure.</p> <p>Six Democrats on Wednesday sent both Mr Biden and Mr McCarthy a letter urging both men to engage in “good faith negotiations that avoid the partisan standoffs of the past”.</p> <p>Warnings are mounting of economic costs if Congress does not raise the limit.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, said at a news conference that the US central bank could not prevent economic catastrophe if lawmakers do not agree to raise the limit.</p> <p>“There is only one way forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling, so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations,” Mr Powell said.</p> <p>“Any deviations from that path would be highly risky” for the economy, he added.</p> <p>The US Treasury Department is employing a range of “extraordinary measures” to ensure that the US can further pay its bills, including interest payments to creditors. But at some point, the country will need to borrow more money to finance its obligations. The nation runs a budget deficit, which means it spends more than it earns, and it borrows huge sums of money to pay everything from military salaries to Social Security benefits.</p> <p>Economists have widely warned of economic crisis if lawmakers do not raise the limit before the government loses the ability to pay all its bills at once, which could happen as soon as June. If the United States cannot borrow more money, it would not be able to make good on a range of financial obligations, including paying bondholders, plunging the nation into default.</p> <p>Republicans are seeking to use the threat of those consequences to force Mr Biden into a debate over taxes, spending, debt and the size of the federal government.</p> <p>Both sides have sought to frame the discussion in favourable terms. Republicans have assailed Democrats for runaway spending, pointing to the stimulus package that Mr Biden signed into law. They blame that spending for fuelling rapid inflation last year, though price increases have since eased. Republican lawmakers say current federal debt levels are unsustainable and risk undercutting economic growth.</p> <p>Mr Biden has said frequently that he is willing to reduce deficits by raising taxes on high earners and corporations – moves Republicans oppose. The president and his aides have tried to push Republicans into detailing specific parts of the federal budget they want to cut, betting on a voter backlash to any proposals that touch popular programs like government health care, education and retirement spending.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/us/politics/biden-mccarthy-debt-limit.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><em>Taipei</em> | In December, China abruptly abandoned its draconian “zero-COVID” policies, battered by a surge of infections and rising public anger against lockdowns. Half a year on, COVID-19 cases are again on the rise, but this time, the nation appears to be determined to press on with normal life as the government <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/wall-street-s-rosy-talk-on-china-s-economy-a-charade-20230522-p5da6f\" target=\"_blank\">focuses on reigniting economic growth.</a></p> <p>Although other countries have long settled into such a pattern, it is a shift for China. Until late last year, its national leadership was still ready to lock down whole neighbourhoods and districts, even cities, in a bid to stamp out what were sometimes just small clusters of cases.</p> <p>Chinese health authorities have reported a rise in COVID-19 cases since April, especially from newer subvariants that are spreading across the world.</p> <p>Zhong Nanshan, a prominent doctor who was among the first to openly confirm in early 2020 that COVID-19 could easily spread among people, has estimated that by late June, as many as 65 million people a week could become infected with the coronavirus across China. (That would be up from what he estimated at 40 million infections a week in late May. China no longer publishes regular official nationwide estimates of infections.)</p> <p>By comparison, after zero-COVID controls were set aside in December, new infections reached 37 million a day in China at their peak, according to estimates cited by Bloomberg.</p> <p>Even if, as Dr Zhong acknowledged, the pace of rising infections was laden with uncertainty, a rebound in cases was always likely, and many in China appear steeled to living with a background hum of COVID-19 infections and sometimes COVID-19 deaths.</p> <p>“People have become used to infections, and they see this as normal in the post-COVID era,” Lin Zixian, 36, who works for a technology company in Beijing, said in a telephone interview.</p> <p>President Xi Jinping still often wears a medical mask when he meets people indoors. But Mr Lin said that he and other members of his family had stopped wearing masks in most public spaces, as have many people in China.</p> <p>“Many of my friends got infected last year and got infected again this year,” Mr Lin said. “Personally, I’m pretty calm about the virus and pandemic.”</p> <p>Officials across China appear to be trying to prepare the population for a rise in infections without reintroducing the heavy controls that by late last year had exhausted public patience. Since abandoning its tight restrictions on domestic travel, the government has shifted to reviving growth and job creation. The <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/foreign-affairs/chinese-graduates-are-asking-where-all-the-good-jobs-went-20230518-p5d9iv\" target=\"_blank\">jobless rate of about 20 per cent among urban youth</a> may appear more politically pressing than rising COVID-19 numbers.</p> <p>“After most people had caught the last wave, the intensity was gone,” said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who has been finishing a book on China’s handling of the pandemic.</p> <p>He said China now treated COVID-19 as a “Class B” illness – not the most urgent category – and officials, although monitoring the latest increase in cases, “have also been trying to reassure the public, saying that the symptoms are relatively mild”.</p> <p>Health officials in Beijing have recommended wearing masks on buses and subways, but it is not mandatory, and quite a few passengers do not, especially younger ones. While the recent rise in cases may yet strain hospitals, many people appear more willing to endure the illness at home rather than heading to fever clinics.</p> <p>More worrisome are older people, many of whom have not had COVID-19 and who may not have received a full round of vaccination shots. Up to three-quarters of Chinese people infected in the recent rise were not infected in the first wave, Dr Zhang Wenhong, the director of the centre for infectious diseases at Huashan Hospital in Shanghai and a major voice in China’s response to COVID-19, said in a recent interview with Chinese media.</p> <p>Dong-yan Jin, a professor of virology at the University of Hong Kong who has tracked China’s response to the virus, concurred that many of those recently infected were likely to be older or physically frail people who were fenced off from the “tsunami” of infections late last year.</p> <p>“The elderly were well protected in the period of the tsunami, because their families and carers tried their best to protect them,” Professor Jin said. “But now the risks for them are high because people are less vigilant.”</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/world/asia/china-covid-lockdowns-economy.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

The body also ordered both Rubiales and the soccer federation he chairs to refrain from contacting Hermoso, a star forward on Spain’s winning national team.</p> <p>The decision came less than a day <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/sport/entire-spanish-world-cup-team-quits-over-forced-kiss-20230826-p5dzlk\" target=\"_blank\">after Spain’s soccer federation said it would stand by Rubiales</a>, who has insisted he did nothing wrong to Hermoso, and threatened legal action to protect the reputation of its president.</p> <p>Rubiales’ kiss at the Women’s World Cup medals ceremony in Sydney – broadcast live to millions – cast a pall over the Spanish team’s celebrations, drawing attention away from a proud national moment and toward a legacy of sexism scandals in Spanish soccer.</p> <p>Hermoso said she had never consented to the kiss but had faced pressure to publicly back Rubiales initially and downplay his actions.</p> <p>“I felt vulnerable and the victim of an impulse-driven, sexist, out-of-place act without any consent on my part,” she said in a statement on Friday, adding that she had initiallyfaced perssure to downplay Rudiales’ actions.</p> <p>Futpro, Spain’s main union of professional female soccer players, has supported Hermoso and criticised Rubiales’ behaviour, as have several Spanish soccer clubs.</p> <p>Many thought Rubiales, who called the kiss a consensual “peck” during a speech, would resign, putting an end to the controversy. His refusal to do so fuelled outrage in a country that views the fight against sexism as a societal priority.</p> <p>Spain’s main union of professional female soccer players, several Spanish soccer clubs and leading politicians, including government ministers, have condemned Rubiales’ behaviour and called for him to step down. And on Saturday, 11 members of the women’s team coaching staff said in a statement that they were resigning “in the face of the unacceptable attitudes and declarations” of Rubiales.</p> <p>The same day, Spain’s top sporting body filed a formal complaint against Rubiales – a vice president of the UEFA, European soccer’s governing body – in an administrative court that handles sporting disputes, accusing him of abusing his authority and violating public sports decorum.</p> <p>“We are ready for this to be the #MeToo of Spanish football and for this to be a change,” Victor Francos Diaz, who directs Spain’s National Sports Council, told reporters on Friday before filing the complaint.</p> <p>Both the kiss and the federation’s forceful defence of its embattled president have prompted debate over a history of accusations of misogyny in Spanish soccer. The previous head coach of the women’s national soccer team, Ignacio Quereda, served for 27 years before being ousted amid allegations of sexism.</p> <p>“This situation has caused structural damage not only to women’s soccer, but also to sport in general and to the values it transmits to society,” said Dolors Ribalta Alcalde, a specialist in women’s soccer at Ramon Llull University in Barcelona.</p> <p>Rubiales holds the No. 3-ranking elected position in UEFA, which pays him €250,000 ($421,000) annually plus expenses. Rubiales made €339,000 ($571,000) in 2021 after taxes for presiding over the Spanish federation.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/26/world/europe/soccer-spain-luis-ruiables-jennifer-hermoso-kiss.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

The ultimate resolution of the issue will have a significant effect not only on the overall viability of the election interference case, but also on whether a trial on the charges is postponed until the heart of the 2024 campaign — or even until after the election.

John Sauer, a lawyer who has been handling appeals for Trump, argued that under the Constitution, judges cannot hold the president accountable for any acts undertaken while in office.</p> <p>“Under our system of separated powers, the judicial branch cannot sit in judgment over a president’s official acts,” Sauer wrote, adding, “That doctrine is not controversial.”</p> <p>But, of course, the fact that this issue was being debated on appeal suggested that it was at the centre of a hotly contested controversy.</p> <p>When Trump initially filed his motion to dismiss the election interference case, his lawyers essentially sought to turn the story told in Smith’s indictment on its head.</p> <p>Prosecutors maintain that Trump has violated the law by seeking, among other things, to strong-arm state lawmakers to keep himself in power, and to pressure Justice Department officials to validate his claims that the election had been marred by fraud.</p> <p>While the prosecutors described those steps as crimes, Trump’s lawyers attempted to reframe them as examples of the former president performing his official duty to protect the integrity of the election.</p> <p>In his brief to the appeals court, Sauer argued that executive immunity must exist, given the fact that no president or former president had ever been charged with a crime before Trump.</p> <p>“The unbroken tradition of not exercising the supposed formidable power of criminally prosecuting a president for official acts — despite ample motive and opportunity to do so, over centuries — implies that the power does not exist,” he wrote.</p> <p>Sauer went on to claim that the trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, had erred in several ways when she decided the issue against Trump at the beginning of the month. In an order rejecting Trump’s immunity claims, Chutkan upheld a limited vision of presidential power, writing that there was nothing in the Constitution or America’s founding documents that supported the idea that a former commander in chief should not be subject to federal criminal law.</p> <p>Chutkan had argued, for example, that Trump should not enjoy “a lifelong ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass,” and that, despite his former role as president, he should still be “subject to federal investigation, indictment, prosecution, conviction and punishment for any criminal acts undertaken while in office.”</p> <p>But Sauer maintained that executive immunity was not meant so much to shield a president — or a former president — from legal responsibility, but rather to prevent a leader from falling prey to false accusations lodged by political enemies. He also said that the only way a former president could be subject to prosecution would be if he had been first impeached and convicted of similar offences by Congress.</p> <p>The immunity case is being heard by a panel made up of Judge Karen L. Henderson, who was appointed by president George H.W. Bush, and Judges Florence Y. Pan and J. Michelle Childs, who were both appointed by President Joe Biden.</p> <p>The judges have agreed to work exceptionally quickly, setting out an expedited schedule for the case at Smith’s request. All written briefs are required to be filed by January 2. The court intends to hold oral arguments January 9.</p> <p>On its own, the fact that the court ordered Trump’s lawyers to file their papers on the Saturday before Christmas suggests just how fast the appellate judges plan to move. Smith’s office is scheduled to file its own papers in the case the Saturday before New Year’s Eve.</p> <p>The struggle between the defence and the prosecution over the speed of the appeal has been just as — or perhaps even more — contentious than the battle over the underlying legal issues. That is largely because Chutkan has put the case on hold as the appeal is being heard, imperilling the trial’s start date of March 4.</p> <p>If the trial were to be pushed into the summer, it would coincide with the homestretch of Trump’s presidential campaign. Obliged to be in Washington each weekday for two or three months, the former president would almost certainly bring his campaign to the courthouse steps, turning the proceeding into even more of a media circus than it already promises to be.</p> <p>The schedule of the election subversion trial in Washington could also have a significant impact on the timing of Trump’s three other criminal cases. It has been a challenge to find time on the calendar for each of the proceedings in relation to one another, as well as against the backdrop of the campaign.</p> <p>Aside from the trial in Washington, Trump is also facing a trial in New York City on charges related to hush money payments to a porn actress in the run-up to the 2016 election; in Florida on charges of illegally holding on to dozens of classified documents after leaving office; and in Georgia, where he stands accused in a racketeering indictment of tampering with that state’s election.</p> <p>While Smith’s prosecutors have never explicitly expressed concerns about that scenario, or the one in which Trump becomes president and orders the charges dropped, they have sought to use every lever at their disposal to keep the trial on schedule.</p> <p>One of their boldest moves was their request last week to the Supreme Court to bypass the appeals court and return its own speedy decision on the immunity issue. While the justices declined to take the case for now, they may have a second opportunity to consider it after the appeals court renders its decision.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/23/us/politics/trump-appeals-court-immunity.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><em>New York</em> | Mary Quant, the British designer who <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/life-and-luxury/fashion-and-style/the-resale-market-is-worth-40-billion-and-fashion-brands-want-in-20230413-p5d04a\" target=\"_blank\">revolutionised fashion</a> and epitomised the style of the Swinging Sixties – a playful, youthful ethos that sprang from the streets, not a Paris atelier – died on Thursday (Friday AEST) at her home in Surrey, in southern England. Known as the mother of the miniskirt, she was 93.</p> <p>England was emerging from its post-war privations when, in 1955, Quant and her aristocratic boyfriend, Alexander Plunket Greene, both just out of art school, opened a boutique called Bazaar on London’s King’s Road, in the heart of Chelsea.</p> <p>Quant filled it with the outfits that she and her Bohemian friends were wearing, “a bouillabaisse of clothes and accessories,” as she wrote in an autobiography, <em>Quant on Quant</em> (1966) – short flared skirts and pinafores, knee socks and tights, funky jewellery and berets in all colours.</p> <p>When she couldn’t find the pieces she wanted, Quant made them herself, buying fabric at retail from Harrods, the luxury department store, and stitching them in her bed-sit.</p> <p>The boutique was a hit from the get-go, with young women sometimes grabbing new clothing from Quant’s arms as she headed into the store. She and Plunket Greene ran it like the coffee bars they frequented: as a hangout and a party at all hours, with a background of jazz.</p> <p>They made their window displays a performance, too, stalked by mannequins designed by a friend to look like the young women who were shopping there – “the birds,” in Quant’s words, using the parlance of the times – figures with sharp cheekbones, mod haircuts and coltish legs.</p> <p>A decade later, Mary Quant was a global brand, with licenses all over the world – she was named an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1966 for her contribution to British exports – and sales that would soon reach $US20 million ($29 million).</p> <p>There was a Mary Quant line at J.C. Penney and boutiques in New York department stores. There was Mary Quant makeup, eyelashes, lingerie, tights, shoes, outerwear and furs. By the 1970s, there were bedsheets, stationery, paint, housewares and a Mary Quant doll.</p> <p>“The celebrity designer is an accepted part of the modern fashion system today, but Mary was rare in the ’60s as a brand ambassador for her own clothes and brand,” said Jenny Lister, a co-curator of a 2019 retrospective of Quant’s work at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London.</p> <p>“She didn’t just sell quirky British cool; she actually was quirky British cool.”</p> <p>“I grew up not wanting to grow up,” Quant once said. “Growing up seemed terrible. To me, it was awful. Children were free and sane, and grown-ups were hideous.”</p> <p>Thanks to Bazaar, King’s Road became the epicentre of British fashion, and London the epicentre of the so-called youthquake. Quant was its avatar, garbed in her signature play clothes and boots, with huge painted eyes and a distinctive bob that would make its creator, Vidal Sassoon, as famous as she.</p> <p>“Vidal put the top on it,” Quant liked to say.</p> <p>Barbara Mary Quant was born February 11, 1930, in Blackheath, southeast London. Her parents, John and Mildred (Jones) Quant, were Welsh teachers who came from mining families. Quant and Plunket Greene married in 1957, and he died in 1990. Quant is survived by their son, Orlando Plunket Greene, and three grandchildren.</p> <p>In 2000, Quant stepped down as director of Mary Quant Ltd. In 2009, she was honoured by the Royal Mail with her own postage stamp. In 2015, Quant was made a dame. The storefront once occupied by Bazaar is now a juice bar, above which a plaque now commemorates Dame Mary Quant.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/fashion/mary-quant-dead.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><em>Seoul</em> | After giving the strongest indication yet that Ukraine’s counteroffensive is imminent, President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday (Sunday AEST) urged his compatriots to personally thank the volunteers and soldiers fighting Russian troops, in a sign of how grim the next phase of the war could be.</p> <p>Mr Zelensky singled out more than a dozen soldiers by name, noting that in his nightly speeches, he usually thanks specific units or brigades. But the latest address was, he said, a collection of “more personal words of gratitude to particular warriors”.</p> <p>His plea to thank soldiers, even if only on social media, followed similar statements from his top military commanders, who have said they are ready for the counteroffensive despite a lack of air defence systems. And his defence minister rebuffed peace talks at a summit of military officials in Singapore on Saturday. Ukraine has also grown bolder, attacking behind Russian lines in past months, another sign of the shifting tone of the war.</p> <p>Shelling by Ukrainian forces on Russia’s Belgorod region continued overnight after two people were killed the previous night and hundreds of children were evacuated away from the border, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.</p> <p>“Overnight, it was quite restless,” Mr Gladkov said on the Telegram channel, adding that several districts suffered “lots” of damage from shelling during the night. More than 4000 people were relocated to temporary accommodation in the region, which borders Ukraine to its south and west, Mr Gladkov said.</p> <p>The reality of the war, which Moscow launched in Ukraine in February 2022, has been increasingly brought to Russia, with intensified shelling on border regions, but also air strikes deep inside the country, including earlier this week on Moscow.</p> <p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> published an interview on the weekend with Mr Zelensky in which he said that Ukraine was ready for the counteroffensive but warned that “a large number of soldiers will die” because Russia retains the upper hand in air power.</p> <p>In addition to the billions of dollars of military aid and advanced weapons that Ukraine has already received from the United States and Europe, Mr Zelensky has been pushing his allies for more air defence systems and F-16 fighter jets.</p> <p>And Ukraine continues to reject proposals of peace talks that do not involve Russia first withdrawing its forces from occupied areas. The latest such proposal was made by <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/foreign-affairs/indonesia-floats-ukraine-peace-plan-sparks-criticism-20230604-p5ddqg\" target=\"_blank\">Prabowo Subianto, the Indonesian defence minister</a>, on Saturday at the international gathering in Singapore.</p> <p>Mr Zelensky’s comments were published a week after Ukraine’s top military commander signalled that the counteroffensive was about to be launched, which analysts have said may have already begun in one form or the other. It is likely to be centred in southern Ukraine and focus on land routes between Russia and Crimea, the Ukrainian territory Moscow illegally annexed in 2014.</p> <p>“There is no perfect time to launch the Ukrainian offensives, but there will be a time that is optimum for Ukrainian force preparations and where they are most able to exploit Russian weaknesses,” Mick Ryan, a military analyst and retired Australian general, wrote Sunday on Twitter. “That time is close.”</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/04/world/europe/zelensky-ukraine-counter-attack.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>The yacht Grazie Mamma II carried its crew along the coastlines and archipelagoes of the Mediterranean. Its last adventure was off the coast of Morocco last week, when it encountered a pod of orcas.</p> <p>The marine animals slammed the yacht’s rudder for 45 minutes, causing major damage and a leak, according to Morskie Mile, the boat’s Polish operators. The crew escaped, and rescuers and the Moroccan navy tried to tow the yacht to safety, but it sank near the port of Tanger Med, the operator said on its website.</p> <p>The account of the sinking is adding to the worries of many sailors along the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula, where marine biologists are studying a puzzling phenomenon: orcas are jostling and ramming boats in interactions that have disrupted dozens of voyages and caused at least four boats in the past two years to sink.</p> <p>The largest of the dolphin family, orcas are playful apex predators that hunt sharks, whales and other prey but are generally amiable to humans in the wild. The orcas hunting in the Strait of Gibraltar are considered to be endangered, and researchers have noticed an upsurge of unusual behaviour since 2020. A small group of the marine animals have been battering boats in the busy routes around Portugal, Spain and Morocco.</p> <p>While most interactions occur in the waters of south-western Europe and North Africa, an orca also reportedly rammed a yacht some 3200 kilometres north off the coast of Scotland, according to<em> The Guardian.</em></p> <p>“Orcas are complex, intelligent, highly social,” said Erich Hoyt, research fellow at Whale and Dolphin Conservation and author of <em>Orca: The Whale Called Killer</em>. “We’re still at the early stages of trying to understand this behaviour.”</p> <p>Researchers have pushed back at the idea that orcas are attacking vessels. Instead, they theorise that the rudders of boats have become a plaything for curious young orcas and that the behaviour has become a learnt fad spreading through the population. Another hypothesis, according to biologists who published a study on the population in June 2022, is that the ramming is an “adverse behaviour” because of a bad experience between an orca and a boat – though researchers tend to favour the first.</p> <p>It is unclear what will stop the ramming, whether it’s playful or otherwise, a point that has left anxious skippers travelling these parts sharing advice in Facebook groups dedicated to tracking such interactions.</p> <p>“It’s been an interesting summer hiding in shallow waters,” said Greg Blackburn, a skipper based in Gibraltar. Orcas slammed into a boat he was commandeering in May and chewed at the rudder, he said, though the vessel was able to return to shore.</p> <p>The encounter left an impression. On a recent trip to Barcelona, Spain, Blackburn had to pass through a patch where orcas had been sighted the week before. “I genuinely felt sick for about three hours,” he said, “just watching the horizon constantly for a fin to pop up.”</p> <p>Conservationists, maritime rescue groups and yacht clubs are partnering to navigate the challenge of preserving an endangered population and helping sailors avoid calamity. The Cruising Association, a club supporting sailors, has recommended safety protocols for orca encounters, such as disconnecting the boat and staying quiet. Skippers have offered one another anecdotal advice to deter attacks, including throwing sand into the water and banging loudly on the boat.</p> <p>Before leaving shore, seagoers can also consult digital platforms that now track reported orca sightings and interactions in the region. This can help them avoid the animals or charter a route closer to shore, said Bruno Díaz López, a biologist and the director of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute based in Galicia, Spain.</p> <p>“We suggested the boats stay in shallow waters,” he said, adding that they had noticed more boats changing their journeys. “Maybe the trip takes longer, yes. But it is worth it.”</p> <p>Blackburn said he had heard of people resorting to throwing firecrackers into the sea to try to scare the animals away, adding that the boats served as people’s homes on the ocean. “At the end of the day, if you’re protecting your home, what are you going to do?”</p> <p>But the ocean is the orcas’ home, and conservationists say scaring the animals is not a solution.</p> <p>“It is not about winning a battle because this is not a war,” López said. “We need to be respectful.”</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/world/africa/orcas-sink-yacht-gibraltar.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><em>London</em> | The Netherlands and Denmark said on Sunday (Monday AEST) that they would donate F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine — the first countries to do so — in what of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said was a breakthrough in his nation’s quest to acquire aircraft considered imperative in the <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/europe/putin-profits-from-global-addiction-to-russia-s-nuclear-fuel-20230810-p5dvlx\" target=\"_blank\">war against Russia</a>.</p> <p>The procurement of American-made F-16s to supplement a fleet of Soviet-era jets has been a priority for Mr Zelensky’s government for months as it seeks advantage over Russia’s air force and to improve its own air defences.</p> <p>Ukrainian officials acknowledged last week, however, that NATO countries would not donate the planes before next year, which is too late for use in a <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/don-t-give-up-on-us-pleads-ukraine-envoy-20230817-p5dxf8\" target=\"_blank\">counteroffensive the government in Kyiv launched</a> this northern summer.</p> <p>President Joe Biden, setting aside months of resistance, said in May that NATO countries could train Ukrainian pilots on F-16s, and on Thursday a US official said that the United States would allow allies to send the jets.</p> <p>Speaking during a visit to the Netherlands, Mr Zelensky said that country would donate 42 jets once Ukrainian pilots and engineers had been trained. He also visited Denmark on Sunday and was in Sweden on Saturday, where aircraft were also on the agenda.</p> <p>“A breakthrough agreement. From today, there are already specifics. They will be in the Ukrainian sky. Thank you, Netherlands,” he said on the Telegram social messaging app. “The planes we will use to keep Russian terrorists away from Ukrainian cities and villages.”</p> <p>He posted a selfie taken with Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands standing in front of one of the jets but gave few specifics about the next step in the process.</p> <p>In what appeared to be a co-ordinated move, Denmark’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that it would donate 19 F-16s to Ukraine.</p> <p>F-16s would enhance the country’s ground-launched air defences, which are used to fight off Russian missile attacks, and could act as a deterrent to Moscow in the longer term because they could erase its aerial superiority.</p> <h2>No decisive blow</h2> <p>For now, Ukraine is pressing ahead with its counteroffensive, launched in June, without the jets, which some military analysts say could have enabled it to deploy large-scale co-ordinated battle tactics used by NATO countries and taught to Ukrainian troops by its allies.</p> <p>Amid heavy fighting in the counteroffensive, Ukraine has recaptured some villages and regained some territory in its south and east, but is yet to make a decisive breach of Moscow’s lines in the face of stiff Russian resistance, stoutly defended barriers and numerous minefields.</p> <p>Asked about the pace of the counteroffensive, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called for caution in making assessments and emphasised the need for allies to deliver more military aid.</p> <p>“What we really need are more long-term capabilities for achieving more short-term results,” he said in an interview with the German newspaper <em>Bild</em>.</p> <p>Ukraine is also pushing to obtain Swedish Gripen warplanes, and Mr Zelensky said during a visit to Sweden this weekend that it was “getting closer” to obtaining them. He also reached a more tangible agreement on Saturday involving the supply of armoured vehicles.</p> <p>Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson did not mention the combat planes during a news conference with Mr Zelensky on Saturday. Ukraine has received Soviet-era jets from Poland and Slovakia.</p> <p>Sweden has so far refused to send Gripens to Ukraine, with officials saying the jets — built by Saab — are needed to defend its own borders. Russia’s invasion prompted Sweden, and neighbouring Finland, to apply to join NATO. Finland has since become a member of the alliance, but Sweden’s application has been held up by Turkey.</p> <p>On Saturday, Sweden and Ukraine announced a preliminary agreement covering production, repair and training for Sweden’s CV90 infantry fighting vehicle. So far in the war, Mr Kristersson said, Sweden has given €2.2 billion ($3.7 billion) in aid to Ukraine, including the CV90s, Leopard tanks, Archer artillery systems, and mine-clearing equipment.</p> <p>Almost 18 months after Russia’s full-scale invasion began, issues of military production and supply are becoming increasingly important to debates about the war’s eventual outcome.</p> <p>They form a backdrop to Ukraine’s attempts to reclaim land and Moscow’s relentless bombardment of civilian areas close to the front lines.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/20/world/europe/ukraine-war-f16-jets.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'How Trump plans to wield power if he wins: Trade wars, crackdowns and revenge',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><strong>Washington: </strong>Since beginning his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump has said the “termination” of the Constitution would have been justified to overturn the 2020 election; told followers, “I am your retribution”; and vowed to use the Justice Department to prosecute his adversaries – starting with US President Joe Biden and his family.</p> <p>Beneath these public threats is a series of plans by Trump and his allies that would upend core elements of American governance, democracy, foreign policy and the rule of law if he regained the White House.</p> <p>Some of these themes trace back to the final period of Trump’s term in office. By that stage, his key advisers had learned how to more effectively wield power, and Trump had fired officials who resisted some of his impulses and replaced them with loyalists. Then he lost the 2020 election and was cast out of power.</p> <p>Since leaving office, Trump’s advisers and allies at a network of well-funded groups have advanced policies, created lists of potential personnel and started shaping new legal scaffolding – laying the groundwork for a second Trump presidency they hope will commence on January 20, 2025.</p> <p>In a vague statement, two top officials on Trump’s campaign have sought to distance his campaign team from some of the plans being developed by Trump’s outside allies, groups led by former senior Trump administration officials who remain in direct contact with him. The statement called news reports about the campaign’s personnel and policy intentions “purely speculative and theoretical”.</p> <p>The plans described here generally derive from what Trump has trumpeted on the campaign trail, what has appeared on his campaign website and interviews with Trump advisers, including some who spoke with <em>The New York Times</em> at the request of the campaign.</p> <h3>Trump wants to use the Justice Department for vengeance</h3> <p>If he wins another term, Trump has said he would use the Justice Department to have his adversaries investigated and charged with crimes, including saying in June that he would appoint “a real special prosecutor to go after” Biden and his family. He later declared in an interview with Univision that he could, if someone challenged him politically, have that person indicted.</p> <p>Allies of Trump have also been developing an intellectual blueprint to cast aside the post-Watergate norm of Justice Department investigatory independence from White House political direction.</p> <p>Foreshadowing such a move, Trump had already violated norms in his 2016 campaign by promising to “lock up” his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, over her use of a private email server. While president, he repeatedly told aides he wanted the Justice Department to indict his political enemies, including officials he had fired, such as James Comey, the former FBI director. The Justice Department opened various such investigations but did not bring charges – infuriating Trump and leading to a split in 2020 with his attorney general, Bill Barr.</p> <h3>Trump intends to carry out an extreme immigration crackdown</h3> <p>Trump is planning to revive and ramp up his first-term attempt to tighten the border with an assault on immigration at a scale unseen in modern American history. Millions of immigrants who entered the US illegally would be banned from the country or uprooted from it years or even decades after settling here.</p> <p>Bolstered by agents reassigned from other law enforcement agencies, officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement would carry out sweeping raids aimed at deporting millions of people each year – an order of magnitude more than previous administrations, including his own.</p> <p>Under the plan, military funds would be used to erect sprawling camps to hold detainees. A public health emergency law would be invoked to shut down asylum requests by people arriving at the border. And the government would try to end birthright citizenship for babies born on US soil to parents without legal status.</p> <h3>Trump plans to go far beyond his first-term trade wars</h3> <p>Trump is also planning to significantly escalate his efforts to upend America’s trade policies with new protectionist measures. While those measures would be aimed at eventually bolstering domestic manufacturing and factory jobs, they would also risk causing more immediate disruptions to the economy.</p> <p>To make domestically produced goods more competitive in the US market, he is planning to impose a new so-called universal baseline tariff, meaning an import tax on “most imported goods”. That would raise costs for US consumers and for manufacturers that buy foreign goods. It would also risk alienating allies and could ignite a global trade war if other countries respond with retaliatory tariffs targeting US exports.</p> <p>Trump started a trade war with China in 2018. While the Biden administration has kept in place the tariffs Trump imposed then, Trump now wants to go much further in spurring an economic conflict between the world’s two largest economies, which exchanged $758 billion in goods and services last year. He plans to “enact aggressive new restrictions on Chinese ownership” of assets in the United States, ban Americans from investing in China and phase in a ban on importing key categories of Chinese-made goods such as electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals.</p> <h3>Trump may undercut NATO and retreat from Europe</h3> <p>Trump has long made clear that he sees NATO, the country’s most important military alliance, not as a force multiplier with allies but as a drain on US resources by freeloaders.</p> <p>While in office, he repeatedly threatened to withdraw from NATO, and his campaign website says he plans to “finish” the process of “fundamentally reevaluating NATO’s purpose and NATO’s mission”. He and his team have refused to elaborate on that cryptic line, fuelling widespread anxiety that his return to power could mean ending or gutting the alliance.</p> <p>But Trump has clearer plans for using US military force closer to home. As president, he had mused about using the military to attack drug cartels in Mexico, an idea that would violate international law unless Mexico consented. That idea has since taken on broader Republican backing, and Trump has said he intends to make the idea a reality if he returns to the Oval Office.</p> <h3>Trump wants to use US troops on domestic soil</h3> <p>Trump could also deploy federal troops inside the United States. While it is generally illegal to use the military for domestic law enforcement purposes, a law called the Insurrection Act creates an exception. His top immigration adviser has said that in a second term, they would invoke the Insurrection Act at the southern border to use soldiers as immigration agents.</p> <p>After some anti-police-violence demonstrations in 2020 became riots, Trump had an order drafted to use troops to crack down on protesters in Washington. He never signed it. But the prospect of using federal troops to enforce order on domestic soil continues to entice him. Trump also suggested at a rally in Iowa this year that he intends to unilaterally send troops into Democratic-run cities.</p> <p>“You look at any Democrat-run state, and it’s just not the same; it doesn’t work,” Trump said, calling cities such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco crime dens. “We cannot let it happen any longer. And one of the other things I’ll do – because you’re supposed to not be involved in that; you just have to be asked by the governor or the mayor to come in – the next time, I’m not waiting.”</p> <h3>Trump allies want fewer checks to restrain him</h3> <p>Forces that somewhat contained Trump’s autocratic tendencies in his first term – staff members who saw their job as sometimes restraining him, a few congressional Republicans episodically willing to criticise or oppose him, a partisan balance on the Supreme Court that occasionally ruled against him – would all be weaker in a second term. As a result, his and his advisers’ more extreme policy plans would have a greater prospect of becoming reality.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important check on his presidency was internal administration resistance to some of his demands. The advisers who have stuck with him are determined that if he wins a new term, there will be no officials who intentionally stymie his agenda.</p> <p>A coalition of think tanks run by people aligned with Trump has been compiling a database of thousands of ideologically vetted potential recruits to hand to a transition team if he wins the election.</p> <p>Politically appointed lawyers sometimes frustrated Trump’s desires by raising legal objections to his and his top advisers’ ideas. In a potential new term, Trump’s allies are planning to systematically install more aggressive and ideologically aligned legal gatekeepers who will be more likely to bless contentious actions.</p> <p>Trump and his 2024 campaign declined to answer a series of detailed questions about what limits, if any, he would recognise on his powers across a range of war, secrecy and law enforcement matters – many raised by his first term – in a <em>Times</em> 2024 presidential candidate survey.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-2025-second-term.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Get a note directly from our foreign </i></b><b><i>correspondents </i></b><b><i>on what’s making headlines around the world. </i></b><b><i>Sign up for our weekly What in the World newsletter</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>Much of political journalism in Australia seems to have been co-opted by politicians, and regrettably many media organisations have surrendered their duty to truth in favour of being bit players in their own craft. A body count of reporters in state and federal press galleries versus the multitudes of ministerial press secretaries and media units arrayed against them illustrates the dangers journalists now face. But some still bravely stand up for the basics tenets of the craft.</p> <p>It happened again in Alice Springs on Thursday when Peter Dutton attempted to make a reporter an extra in his campaign against the Indigenous Voice to parliament. The opposition leader clashed with an ABC journalist Lee Robinson in Alice Springs after the reporter asked what evidence Dutton was relying on to support his claim of “rampant” child sexual abuse occurring in remote central Australia. Robinson also asked Dutton why he thought a key peak body had opposed his call for a royal commission into abuse.</p> <p>“That’s such an ABC question,” Dutton spat back. “Do you live locally? I mean, do you speak to people on the street? Do you hear what it is they’re saying to you?”</p> <p>The journalist <em>did</em> live in Alice Springs. And he was simply quoting opposition to a royal commission into sex abuse by the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care. With three questions, Dutton deflected the question, raised doubts about the journalist’s qualifications to ask, and thoughtlessly trivialised the position of the respected and publicly funded national peak body in Australia representing the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, people who see the world through Dutton’s eyes will see little harm in attacking those they perceive not to share their world view. But that is to misinterpret journalism’s main goal: telling the truth.</p> <p>Politicians from all sides habitually turn on the media. Over the years the ABC has copped flak from all sides of politics – sometimes deserved, often not. The criticism may be an unavoidable consequence perhaps of being funded from the public purse. It used to be called “shooting the messenger”, a phrase press-ganged into service ever since Sophocles wrote in <em>Antigone</em>, “no one loves the messenger who brings bad news”. Politicians used it to deflect and dodge. But something new and nasty has entered the equation between politicians and journalists.</p> <p>Donald Trump’s unexpected success has made truth a tradeable commodity. From the moment Trump walked into the political arena as a presidential candidate, his personal attacks and rapid-fire assertions with little basis in truth became his trademark, with the result that trust in the value of a free press and the integrity of the US electoral system has been undermined. Elected, Trump also eschewed press conferences and sparred with reporters on the fly, further confusing and obfuscating his policies and reducing the role of a free press.</p> <p>Trump’s continued outrageous bravado has fostered a new sense of incivility in political and media relations across the world. It surfaced in Australia recently when Paul Keating chose to attack journalists during a speech to the National Press Club. In his long parliamentary career the former prime minister’s abusive way with an epithet endeared him to many journalists, not least for his way with words but his daring to speak the unutterable. That all went by the board last month when <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/paul-keating-calls-nuclear-submarines-worst-decision-by-labor-government-since-wwi-conscription-20230315-p5csba.html\" target=\"_blank\">Keating finished berating his own Labor government</a> for adopting AUKUS and policies towards China, only to launch a <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/paul-keating-calls-nuclear-submarines-worst-decision-by-labor-government-since-wwi-conscription-20230315-p5csba.html\" target=\"_blank\">Keating finished berating his own Labor government</a> Peter Hartcher and Matthew Knott, telling one to “hang your head in shame”.</p> <p>It is one thing for Keating, long past his political use-by date, to use abuse as a form of public discourse, but Dutton is a leader attempting to drag the Liberal Party into contention. His retreat into offence is a cynical, and ultimately corrosive approach that only undermines the public’s trust in the media.</p> <p><b><i>Bevan Shields sends an exclusive newsletter to subscribers each week. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56l8d\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Sign up to receive his Note from the Editor</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'The Handmaid’s Tale among the books banned in ‘parents rights’ push across the US',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><strong>Jacksonville, Florida:</strong> Two years into a surge of book bans across the United States, Florida is a hot spot in the clash over what reading material is appropriate for children, with laws that have greatly expanded the state’s ability to restrict books.</p> <p>Historically, books were challenged one at a time. As bans in schools and libraries began increasing nationally in 2021, efforts were largely local, led by a parent or a group. But over the past year, access to books, particularly those touching on race, gender or sexual orientation, became increasingly politicised. With that came an increase in legislation and regulations in some states and school districts that affected which books libraries could offer.</p> <p>The shift is particularly evident in Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican-controlled Legislature and a rapidly growing network of conservative groups aligned to pass three state laws last year aimed, at least in part, at reading or educational materials. Among the books removed from circulation in one of the state’s school districts are Toni Morrison’s <em>Beloved</em> and Margaret Atwood’s <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>.</p> <p>The policies have energised DeSantis’ supporters and are part of the platform from which he is expected to run for president.</p> <p>Proponents of the restrictions say their aims are to protect students from inappropriate materials and to give parents more control over their children’s education. In focusing on “parents’ rights,” DeSantis is trying to build on the popularity he amassed when he resisted COVID-19 restrictions, particularly in schools. The push is a signature part of the conservatism he is showcasing in Florida. His Parental Rights in Education law, for example, constrains instruction on gender and sexuality, which has led some districts to remove books with LGBTQ characters.</p> <p>Some teachers and librarians say the policies are vague, with imprecise language and broad requirements, leading to some confusion. But they are trying to comply. Violation of the law could be a third-degree felony; in general, such crimes are punishable by up to five years in prison</p> <p>In January, when the new guidelines went into effect, some teachers removed or covered up books that had not been vetted by certified media specialists, whose approval is now legally required. Others are not ordering titles that could draw complaints. Some educators emptied shelves or pulled collections until the titles could be reassessed.</p> <p>“It is a whole new level of fear,” said Kathleen Daniels, president of the Florida Association for Media in Education, a professional organisation for school librarians and media educators. “There are books that are not being selected because they have been challenged.”</p> <p>Florida ranks second, behind Texas, as the state with the highest number of book removals, according to a report released last Thursday from free-speech organisation PEN America, which tracked book bans in schools from July 1 to December 31. But PEN said Florida’s broad, state-level approach, with “wholesale bans” that restrict access to “untold numbers of books in classrooms and school libraries,” made the true extent of book removals in the state difficult to quantify.</p> <p>Many of the new restrictions come from a law passed last year that requires trained media specialists to evaluate each schoolbook to ensure that it is age-appropriate and free of “pornographic” content. The law also requires schools to keep a searchable online database of the books in their libraries and classrooms.</p> <p>Proposed legislation goes further. In March, the Florida House passed a bill that could require schools to remove a book promptly based on a single complaint from a parent or county resident that the book depicted sexual conduct. Under the proposed bill, the book would remain unavailable until the complaint was resolved.</p> <p>Two other laws are contributing to book bans in Florida schools. The Stop WOKE Act prohibits instruction that could make students feel guilty or responsible for the past actions of other members of their race. The Parents Rights in Education law prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in some elementary grades; a state rule is expected to expand the restrictions through 12th grade.</p> <p>Efforts by Florida’s 67 public school districts to put the new regulations into practice have been uneven and often chaotic. Some districts have taken no major action. Others enacted blanket removals that essentially gutted libraries.</p> <p>Earlier this year, soon after the new guidelines for libraries were issued in January, some districts moved quickly to comply. In Duval County, home to Jacksonville, the public school district restricted access to more than 1 million titles, keeping them out of students’ hands until they were vetted by specialists. In Manatee County, on Florida’s Gulf Coast, some teachers boxed up their classroom libraries or covered their shelves. Officials in Martin County, on the state’s Atlantic Coast, removed around 150 books from school circulation in January and February, including John Green’s <em>Looking for Alaska</em> and James Patterson’s <em>Maximum Ride</em>, a series of sci-fi adventure books for readers ages 10 and up, which were pulled from elementary schools.</p> <p>Patterson, who lives in Palm Beach, called the removal of his books “frightening”.</p> <p>“When you can take a mainstream series like <em>Maximum Ride</em> and take it off the shelves,” he said, “it shows that no one is safe.” A county spreadsheet gave no specific reason for the series’ removal.</p> <p>Training material advised media specialists to consider how they would feel reading passages from the book in question aloud. “If you would not be comfortable reading the material in a public setting,” said a slideshow by the state’s Department of Education, “then you should lean towards not making the material available in a school library for children.”</p> <p>Jennifer Pippin leads a local chapter of the group Mums for Liberty in Florida and was on the Department of Education panel that helped design the training materials. She said books that had been removed from school libraries in the state should not be considered “banned” because they remained available at public libraries and in bookstores.</p> <p>Young people in a school library might happen to pick up a book that contains a graphic rape scene, she said, because they enjoyed other volumes in the same series. Or a child interested in penguins might open a book about a penguin family with two dads. But “it may not be appropriate for them per their parents’ standards,” she said. “With no instruction or parental guidance, some of these things could indeed be harmful.”</p> <p>In Duval County, the school district asked the district’s 54 media specialists in January to begin reviewing the more than 1.6 million titles. Unapproved books, elementary teachers were told, had to be covered or set aside.</p> <p>About 25,000 books had cleared the review process as of early this month. The ongoing process has left Duval County’s more than 129,000 students with access to only a tiny fraction of available titles, critics said.</p> <p>“Our books are being shadow-banned,” said Nina Perez, a Jacksonville resident and a director for MumsRising, an advocacy organisation opposing the restrictions. “They get mired in an administrative process.”</p> <p>Tracy Pierce, a Duval school district spokesperson, said in an email last month that the actions had followed guidance from the state’s Department of Education. At no time should classrooms have been without reading material, she said, since students still had access to approved books and collections. She acknowledged that “a small number of principals did close or overly restrict” media centres briefly and were advised to restore access.</p> <p>DeSantis has reacted aggressively to criticism that public schools are banning books. He dismissed news reports that Duval County schools had removed a title about baseball player Roberto Clemente as “a joke,” accusing critics of “manufacturing” a narrative about book bans.</p> <p>The book, which addresses the racism that Clemente faced, was removed and then restored in February after a review. Last month, the state’s education commissioner named the title, <em>Roberto Clemente: Pride of the Pittsburgh Pirates</em> by Jonah Winter, a book of the month for third through fifth grades.</p> <p>At a news conference last month, DeSantis stood behind a sign that read “Exposing the Book Ban HOAX” and said that the state was trying to protect children from pornographic material. The event began with a presentation on books reported to districts for removal — including <em>Gender Queer</em>, by Maia Kobabe, and <em>Flamer</em>, by Mike Curato – and highlighted scenes about sexual contact and masturbation.</p> <p>“This idea of a book ban in Florida, that somehow they don’t want books in the library – that’s a hoax,” DeSantis said. “And that’s really a nasty hoax, because it’s a hoax in service of trying to pollute and sexualise our children.”</p> <p>Critics in the state are pushing back. In March, Democracy Forward, an advocacy organisation, filed a lawsuit with the state on behalf of the Florida Education Association and other groups challenging the rules, arguing that they censor educators, limit students’ access to books and harm public education. The Florida Freedom to Read Project organised a rally in Tallahassee last month with authors and free-speech activists to protest censorship.</p> <p>After Brian Covey, a substitute teacher in Jacksonville, posted a video in January of empty library shelves at a Duval County middle school, a reporter asked DeSantis about it. DeSantis called the video a “fake narrative.” Covey, who lost his job shortly after, said he was troubled that DeSantis and the school district tried to delegitimise what he had documented.</p> <p>The fact that they called it a false narrative, Covey said, “tells me that they have no intention of saying, ‘We made a mistake.’”</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/22/books/book-ban-florida.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a></strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>Little in America has seemed quite right in the seven years since Donald Trump won his improbable election victory in 2016.</p> <p>The news that the US government is indicting the former president on four counts of attempting to overturn the 2020 election might seem to be in keeping with the <em>Through the Looking Glass</em> world that Trump – by turns malevolent and buffoonish – led us into. But in fact, the move is a big step back into reality.</p> <p>Trump is, of course, presumed innocent – but now let’s see what the evidence is against him. That’s normal, and that’s a tribute to the American system. The fact it took 2½ years to get here is problematic, but that’s a discussion for another time.</p> <p>All that said, the 16 months between now and the presidential election will be a rollercoaster ride, and 2024 promises to be the weirdest political year of our lifetimes.</p> <p>First of all, the Republican presidential primary, in which Trump is far and away the front-runner, will be surreal. The predictable line-up of second-tier politicians and narcissistic nobodies has manifested itself. But they have been, with the exception of outspoken Trump critic Chris Christie, subdued.</p> <p>In a normal primary, your opponents would never shut up about your failings. A calamitous pandemic response. Cozying up to Russia, racists and militias. A thoroughly corrupt administration. Two impeachments. Doing nothing while goons and creeps attempted to sack the US Capitol. Being found responsible for sexually assaulting a woman. Accusations of criminal campaign violations, and then retaining classified documents and obstructing justice.</p> <p>And yet no one besides Christie brings up any of this. The reason: they aren’t really running against Trump. They merely hope to be standing fairly close to him at the moment he might get taken down. That’s not a normal election.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it’s fair to point out that both Trump and his opponent, President Joe Biden, are old. Trump was the oldest-ever US president – until Biden succeeded him. Way back when, we thought Ronald Reagan was too old when he became president at the ripe old age of 69. On Inauguration Day 2025, Trump will be 78 (older than Reagan was when he left office), and Biden 82.</p> <p>Either Trump or Biden could have a heart attack, fall or suffer some debilitating ailment between now and then, throwing their party, and perhaps the election, into turmoil. Democrats are playing with fire as well; if something were to happen to Biden, his presumed successor, Kamala Harris, would be a much weaker candidate.</p> <p>In any case, as the primaries proceed, and we head to the general election, it seems assured that one of the candidates will be in and out of courtrooms facing a sprawling array of charges. The cases against Trump are in some ways complex; the actual trials in at least one and perhaps all may be delayed past the election, potentially raising bizarre constitutional issues. (Can a sitting US president be sent to jail in, say, Georgia?)</p> <p>The new charges have a wildcard, too: a <em>Star Wars</em> cantina of co-conspirators may be facing their own trials during election season. (They are as yet unnamed, but the indictment contains hints that one is Rudy Giuliani, the one-time respected mayor of New York City who has become one of Trump’s most degraded myrmidons.) These legal madhouses will dominate the news. Trump’s opponents in the Republican primary will find it hard to get noticed. And in the general election, it’s hard to imagine the media talking about anything but Trump Trump Trump.</p> <p>One more twist: spoiler candidates. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, son of the assassinated senator, is mounting a fruitless but potentially damaging campaign against Biden for the Democratic nomination. He’s an anti-vax crusader and conspiracy theorist – and getting multimillion-dollar donations from people on the right. There’s also a mysterious group called No Labels, funded by so-called “dark money”, working to put a purportedly independent candidate on the general-election ballot to siphon votes away from Biden in swing states.</p> <p>These moves might prove consequential. A razor-thin vote count in Florida, you will recall, put the second George Bush into the White House in 2000. His official margin of victory over Al Gore? Five hundred votes. Progressive activist Ralph Nader, on the Florida ballot as well, took almost 100,000 votes away from Democrats.</p> <p>Barring a health scare or the significant rise of one of those third-party stalking horses, Biden should take Trump out cleanly in November 2024. Yes, there have been some recent polls showing a close race that have Democrats atwitter.</p> <p>Still, this is the big picture: Biden beat Trump by 7 million votes in 2020, a fact that you will never hear uttered in Trumpland. Since then, the Supreme Court’s tectonic abortion decision, which allowed states to ban the procedure, continues to polarise younger voters against the Republicans. Right now, the economic outlook seems positive for the Democrats.</p> <p>In the all-important Electoral College, the state-by-state vote that technically determines the winner, Biden won by 74 electoral votes in 2020. Since then, two of the four key battleground states, Michigan and Wisconsin, have swung wildly Democratic; the other two, Arizona and Georgia, have been trending steadily blue.</p> <p>To win, Trump will have to figure out a way to expand his base of support. If the past seven years are any guide, he will reach a new low, and will fare much worse than we thought possible.</p> <p>But could something raise to favour Trump? To paraphrase Sarah Palin: Oh, you betcha. Consider this. Remember those four swing states? If Trump does manage to campaign well, and takes Arizona and Wisconsin back, and then wins either Michigan or Georgia as well, the result would be … an Electoral College tie between Trump and Biden!</p> <p>The resulting constitutional rabbit hole would melt down cable news and social media, and throw the world’s greatest democracy into uncharted territory, or at least an episode of <em>Veep</em>.

       "   'description': '<p>You can get insurance for almost anything nowadays. It is next to impossible, however, to insure against Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The time for America’s allies to hedge against Trump 2.0 is today.</p> <p>A year from now, when Trump could be president-elect, would be far more expensive. Unfortunately, there are no easy or foolproof ways of doing that.</p> <p>The starting point is to accept that <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/biden-s-desperate-battle-to-halt-global-conflict-20231205-p5ep15\" target=\"_blank\">Trump’s return would be far worse for the “global west”</a> than his first term. In 2020, Joe Biden campaigned on the theme that Trump was an aberration; he did not reflect America’s true values.</p> <p>That article of faith would be drained of meaning with a Trump second term. America would have re-elected him with its eyes wide open.</p> <p>There is no point in pretending that a man who believes that any election he loses is rigged, that the judicial system is rotten and corrupt, and that his political enemies belong in jail, is a believer in democracy. As Robert Kagan persuasively sets out in the <em>Washington Post</em>, Trump would come into office with a plan and a team to execute it. His aim is dictatorship.</p> <p>If the courts and the free media could not hold Trump to account after he was turned out of power, they would have scant hope of doing so once he had regained it. Short-term hedges would not do. The world would have to assume that America had permanently changed course.</p> <p>The only decent insurance is based on the worst-case scenario. On that basis, we have to assume that Trump’s victory would be taken as a green light by Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping to make big advances in their agendas. The US would pull out of NATO.</p> <p>Ukraine would be left to its own devices. Allies and friends in Asia would have to adjust to a world in which the US no longer underwrites their security.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the US would abandon efforts to tackle global warming, uphold human rights and at least pay lip service to the rule-based international order. Trump’s plan for a 10 per cent tariff on all imports would make the open world trading system a distant memory.</p> <h2>Going nuclear</h2> <p>The most worrying hedge against Washington’s exit from Pax Americana would be a rush for the nuclear threshold. Among America’s allies, Japan, South Korea and Australia are each technically capable of going nuclear within months.</p> <p>It would be politically harder for Japan to cross that line given its unique history as the only target of nuclear attack. But the de facto removal of America’s nuclear umbrella would probably outweigh that moral legacy.</p> <p>For similar reasons, it would be a deep wrench for Germany to go nuclear. Since Berlin decided to abandon civil nuclear power in 2011, that threshold would also take longer to cross.</p> <p>Where there is a will, however, there is a way. A resurgent Putin gaining territory in Ukraine while threatening Poland, the Baltics, Romania and Moldova could transform the nature of Germany’s debate.</p> <p>Going nuclear is one form of hedging against a permanently Trumpian US. Such a Gadarene stampede, however, would not be confined to America’s friends. Iran is within roughly a year of nuclear breakout.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt are all capable of joining the bandwagon. Stopping Iran from crossing that threshold is one war to which Trump probably would sign up.</p> <p>Another option for America’s allies would be to move closer to the revisionist powers. Given Germany and France’s history of attempting to accommodate Russia, such a shift cannot be ruled out.</p> <p>Indeed, default appeasement of Moscow is likelier than a European defence union in the near future. Germany embraced its Z – a historic turning point – <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/us-out-of-money-for-ukraine-white-house-warns-20231205-p5ep0z\" target=\"_blank\">after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.</a> But the U-turn is incomplete and went against decades of German diplomacy. If the US walked off the chessboard, it is not hard to imagine a German reverse <i>Zeitenwende. </i></p> <p>Among the large European powers, only the UK could be relied on to stick with Ukraine. In America’s absence, however, Britain lacks the resources to shoulder the burden. Italy has been firmly pro-Ukraine under Giorgia Meloni’s premiership.</p> <p>That would change overnight if Trump returned to the White House. The Baltic states and Poland would become lonely bulwarks against Russia’s westwards creep.</p> <p>The sooner the west confronts the spectre of Trump’s return, the likelier it is to choose more principled forms of insurance. European states have far deeper habits of co-operation with each other than is true of their Asian counterparts. It would also be easier to resist Russia than China. But these are straws in the wind. If Trump wins, everything changes.</p>',\n",

       "   'headline': '‘He wanted to control everything’: Inside the sexist world of Spanish women’s soccer',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>Last summer, when Beatriz Alvarez landed the job as president of the Spanish women’s soccer league, she asked to meet the chief of the country’s soccer federation by videoconference, she said, so she could remain home with her newborn child.</p> <p>After decades of being an inconsistently run afterthought, women’s soccer had recently become fully unionised and professional. Alvarez had much to discuss.</p> <p>But Luis Rubiales, the now-embattled president of the soccer federation, refused, Alvarez recalled in an interview. He told her to send someone else. She said he told her that, rather than attending a meeting, she should set an example by “devoting myself to my maternity”.</p> <p>Alvarez said the meetings went on without her. She said the incident was just one of many subtle and not-so-subtle reminders over the years that, in the eyes of Spain’s top soccer official, women should know their place.</p> <p>This power imbalance burst into public view after Spain won the World Cup last month and Rubiales forcibly kissed the star player, Jenni Hermoso, on live television. On Wednesday, Hermoso filed a criminal complaint with state prosecutors, advancing an inquiry into whether the kiss was an act of sexual aggression.</p> <p>The kiss unleashed widespread backlash and provoked a reckoning in women’s soccer in the country. On Tuesday, Spain fired its women’s national coach, Jorge Vilda, whom players had separately criticised for his domineering, even humiliating management style. Replacing him is Montse Tome, 41, the first woman to hold that position in Spain.</p> <p>In interviews, more than a dozen women involved in Spanish soccer described more than a decade of systemic sexism ranging from paternalism and offhand remarks to verbal abuse. Women said they got bedtime checks and were ordered to leave their hotel doors ajar at night. One high-ranking official quit after concluding that her hiring was just window dressing. And Veronica Boquete, a former national team captain, recalled that Vilda’s predecessor, Ignacio Quereda, told players, “What you really need is a good man and a big penis.”</p> <p>Quereda has denied being verbally abusive.</p> <p>With his kiss and his defiance in the face of suspension and public recrimination, Rubiales is the face of that system. Alvarez called him an “egocentric chauvinist” who never cared about the women’s league and ran the sport “based on belittlement and humiliation”.</p> <p>Rubiales did not respond to an interview request, and his soccer federation declined to answer questions or even forward them to Rubiales, citing his suspension by FIFA, soccer’s world governing body. He has described himself as a victim of “false feminism”.</p> <p>While players say they will boycott the national team unless Rubiales is gone, they also say that his departure would not be enough. The issues in Spanish soccer predate his arrival and require major changes to address, they say. Dozens of current and former players have signed a statement demanding management changes. They air their grievances and strategize in a WhatsApp group called Se Acabo, Spanish for “It’s Over”.</p> <p>Players want higher wages, contracts that continue during maternity leave and access to the same nutritionists and physical therapists as men. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/world/europe/spain-women-soccer-strike.html\" target=\"_blank\">And they are going on strike to get them</a>. Union officials say that the minimum wage for women is €16,000 (a little less than $27,000), compared with €180,000 (more than $302,000) for their male counterparts.</p> <p>Ana Munoz, the soccer federation’s former vice president for integrity, said that instead of prize money at the end of a competition she witnessed, players received tablets. “I have daughters,” she recalled Rubiales remarking. “I know what women would want.”</p> <p>Munoz, who resigned in 2019 after a year on the job, recounted for the first time the reasons for her departure. “I was just there for decoration,” she said. “A flower pot.” She said she questioned the ethics of several of Rubiales’ decisions, including a $US43 million ($67 million) deal to move a soccer competition to Saudi Arabia. That move is under investigation, along with public allegations by his former chief of staff and others that Rubiales used federation money to host a sex party at a coastal villa in the south of Spain. (Rubiales has previously denied any wrongdoing in either case.)</p> <p>Fifteen of the federation’s 18 board members were men, Munoz recalled. When she called for the temporary removal of a member pending a criminal investigation into whether he had spent federation funds on home renovations and his wife’s business, she said she was swiftly voted down. She said she had no authority. “I couldn’t understand that a department of integrity didn’t deal with integrity issues,” she said.</p> <p>Players tried and failed to force change last year over the behaviour of Vilda, the now-fired national coach.</p> <p>Boquete recalled that on the national team from 2015 to 2017, when she was captain and Vilda was coach, he insisted that, when women gathered for coffee, they do so where he could see them. She said he wanted to monitor their body language, whom they were meeting and whether they were complaining about him. Team captains were told where to sit at meals, she said, so he could maintain eye contact with them.</p> <p>Vilda also required players to keep their doors open at night until he could check that each of them was in bed. “If you go into the other rooms, maybe you’ll talk about him,” Boquete said. “He wanted to control everything.”</p> <p>It’s unclear whether that continued for the most recent national team. The players have declined to speak publicly amid the controversy. People close to the players said the women feared retribution. And in the few cases in which agents said their clients did want to talk, the clubs shut them down.</p> <p>Fifteen players ultimately banded together and refused to play under Vilda. Rubiales refused to fire him, and the federation responded by requiring that the players apologise for their actions before considering whether to allow them to return to the team.</p> <p>Some players were particularly angry last month, after the World Cup victory and the controversy over the kiss, when Rubiales not only refused to step down and apologise but also announced that he planned to renew Vilda’s contract and give him a raise. That plan came to a halt this week with Vilda’s termination, but Rubiales is clinging to his job. Although the federation has not fired him, it called his behaviour at the World Cup “totally unacceptable”.</p> <p>Rubiales resisted the idea of professional women’s soccer from the beginning, records show. In 2020, during discussions about creating a unionised, official women’s soccer league, the national federation under Rubiales opposed the idea, according to a document from Spain’s National Sports Council.</p> <p>Rubiales questioned whether clubs could afford the upgrade, recalled Maria Jose Lopez, the top lawyer for Spain’s chief players’ union, who was involved in the discussions. But she suspected Rubiales really did not want to cede power to the women’s teams. “In particular, he didn’t want the clubs to negotiate TV broadcasting rights,” Lopez said.</p> <p>Generations of female athletes have endured demeaning comments.</p> <p>When an unofficial Barcelona women’s team played its inaugural match on Christmas in 1970, the public announcer kept asking, “Has her bra broken?” as players ran onto the field, team members have recalled.</p> <p>The following year, Jose Luis Perez-Paya, then the president of Spain’s soccer federation, said: “I’m not against women’s football, but I don’t like it, either. I don’t think it’s feminine from an aesthetic point of view. Women are not favoured wearing shirts and shorts.”</p> <p>Decades later, Rubiales cracked a similar joke on live television. Monica Marchante, a Spanish sports commentator, recalled being on air with him as players wore T-shirts and shorts after practice. “They’re in their underwear,” he joked. In an interview, Marchante said she smiled politely but realised then that Rubiales was “old-fashioned and rancid”.</p> <p>Alvarez, the league president, said the soccer federation also tried to sabotage the opening of the 2022-23 women’s season by helping to orchestrate a referee strike that postponed the opening weekend. The federation, she said, is a “corrupt structure”.</p> <p>In January, when the Barcelona club team won the Women’s Super Cup, an important Spanish competition, Rubiales and other top federation officials skipped the medal ceremony. Players had to collect their medals from containers.</p> <p>Spain is far from alone in its treatment of female players. In 2004, FIFA’s president at the time, Sepp Blatter, suggested that women could enhance their sport by wearing tighter shorts. During a 2015 interview in Zurich, he repeatedly petted a <em>New York Times</em> reporter’s hair.</p> <p>European powers such as England and Germany barred women from playing for years until 1970.</p> <p>“The Spaniards are not outliers,” said Andrei Markovits, a University of Michigan politics professor and the author of <em>Women in American Soccer and European Football</em>. “They are totally the norm.”</p> <p>Spain’s professional women’s soccer season was set to kick off this weekend. But on Wednesday, the attention was on an office in downtown Madrid, where league and union representatives were meeting to discuss salaries and working conditions. On Thursday, union leaders said no agreement had been reached, and the players <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/38340678/spain-liga-f-players-striking-first-2-games-season\" target=\"_blank\">would strike for the first two weeks of the season</a>.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/world/europe/womens-soccer-spain-sexism.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p> <p><strong><i>The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. </i><i>Sign up here</i><i>.</i></strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>Donald Trump is about to become the first person in US history to face criminal charges before a federal judge that he appointed. Her name is Aileen Cannon, she was confirmed to the court a few days after Trump lost the 2020 election, and has made some truly idiosyncratic procedural rulings in Trump’s favour during this particular investigation, which were quickly smacked down on appeal.</p> <p>Now, with a trial in the offing, the computer that assigns cases to judges has happened incredibly upon her. So, while Trump and his supporters thunder about this indictment as a political conspiracy that threatens to kill the republic, some lawyers less in Trump’s thrall are already demanding Cannon recuse herself or be replaced.</p> <p>This captures, in miniature, the deep, turgid quagmire the Trump indictment inevitably is.</p> <p>First, it should give pause to anyone inclined to assume Trump will be convicted. Before this gets anywhere near a jury, Cannon will have to rule on a series of questions about what evidence gets into the trial, and what evidence is kept out on a range of bases – improper conduct in the investigation, or lawyer-client privilege, for example. That could have a profound effect on the case.</p> <p>But second, it shows how this matter is so thoroughly, inescapably political, that it courts disaster no matter how it lands. In the circumstances, it’s hard to decide which result will tear the country apart more: conviction or acquittal.</p> <p>Which raises an obvious question: should the charges have been brought at all? On one hand, how could they not be? The classified documents Trump has allegedly taken home include sensitive national security information.</p> <p>Apparently, they were carelessly stored, and even shown to people without the necessary security clearance. Sure, presidents often end up having classified documents in places they shouldn’t, but these are typically handed over upon request. Had Trump done the same, this whole matter might have long been settled.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Trump did no such thing, denying, delaying and fighting these requests for months on end. He even claimed he had made the documents unclassified, but prosecutors have a recording of him specifically describing at least some of the documents as “secret information”, before adding “as president, I could have declassified … Now I can’t”.</p> <p>Faced with documents of this seriousness, and brazenness of this shamelessness, it’s easy to see why the Department of Justice would want to prosecute to deter anything like this in the future.</p> <p>No doubt it carries unpredictable political consequences, but is it for prosecutors to consider them? Do we really want to see prosecutors decide whether or not to proceed by figuring out what they think politics demands?</p> <p>As a matter of abstract principle, I’d much prefer to see prosecutors pursue serious felonies on their own terms, for their own seriousness, and let the political chips fall where they may. I’d quite like them specifically not to think about politics.</p> <p>Except the Department of Justice has an established custom of not investigating or charging candidates in the lead-up to an election. That might seem a subordination of the law to politics, but actually it’s something like the reverse: minimising the scope for politics to weaponise and corrupt legal processes.</p> <p>The Department of Justice is under the control of the attorney-general: a political figure. Once you open the door to prosecuting candidates – especially front-running candidates from the opposing party – you open a door to very dark possibilities indeed.</p> <p>The conventional wisdom is surely that letting a candidate get away with some wrongdoing is a lesser evil than letting an incumbent administration use this power to manipulate (or eliminate) its opposition. Those insensitive to that risk might wish to consider how this power might look in the hands of the next Republican president, possibly even Trump himself after having had it used against him.</p> <p>In fairness, Attorney-General Merrick Garland does seem sensitive to this. Three days after Trump announced his candidacy, Garland transferred the investigation – which had already commenced – to an independent special counsel. It’s about the most Garland could do without simply suspending the investigation, but that doesn’t mean it’s enough to render the whole investigation apolitical.</p> <p>Certainly not in an environment so totally political as the current United States. And certainly not when the charges themselves are directly connected to Trump’s political status as a former president.</p> <p>Perhaps it would be different if the charges were confined to his private life – say, something to do with tax fraud. But as things stand, Trump is exactly where he works best: at the centre of the political conversation, railing against the elites who run a corrupt system designed to bring him down because they didn’t like his presidency.</p> <p>His opponents see the unprecedented nature of all this as evidence of the singular threat Trump poses to democratic life. His supporters see it as evidence of the lengths to which his persecutors will go to satisfy their obsessions. In the end, Trump is either exonerated or martyred. For his style of politics, either works.</p> <p>The wiser path might have been not to pursue this until after the election. Sure, that leaves the possibility Trump wins that election and escapes all accountability for his actions. But this indictment might only have increased the chances of that victory, anyway.</p> <p>At which point, President Trump could simply pardon himself for any conviction, and suffer no crisis of legitimacy among his ardent supporters, and perhaps even his more lukewarm ones. After all, they will have noted the indictment and already factored it into their vote.</p> <p>What a hopeless paradox. So fused are politics and the law in American life now that neither can stand alone in its proper place.</p> <p>The court becomes merely another theatre for politics, in which rulings gain their legitimacy from little more than the extent to which they give people the answers their politics demand. Which is to say, roughly half the country is apt to consider them illegitimate at any given moment.</p> <p>But when everything is political, politics itself suffers irreparably because ultimately, politics needs things which sit outside it in order to flourish.</p> <p>It needs institutions that can restrain it, resolve its deadlocks, escape its logic of winning at all costs, bind partisan foes. Can such things exist in America any more? Perhaps one day, we could ask Aileen Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Waleed Aly is a regular columnist. </strong></p> <p><b><i>The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own. </i></b><b><i>Sign up here</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>Two years since he incited an attempted coup and just 12 months out from the US election primaries, Donald Trump is more likely to end up in prison than back in the Oval Office.</p> <p>A combination of legal and political woes make it highly improbable the 45th president will secure the Republican nomination. His days as leader of the free world are almost certainly over, leaving only two questions: will Trump control the chosen GOP candidate, and can he stay out of jail?</p> <p>Remarkably, it seems the man who inspired his supporters to attack the world’s most recognised symbol of democratic government has finally committed the only truly unacceptable political sin: losing.</p> <p>Trump has thrown away the last three US election cycles including the 2018 midterms, the 2020 presidential poll and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/warnock-or-walker-the-last-battle-of-the-us-midterms-under-way-in-georgia-20221207-p5c49i.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the 2022 midterms, where Democrats unexpectedly held onto the Senate.</a> All but one of Trump’s handpicked election-denier candidates lost.</p> <p>Against a highly beatable Joe Biden, whose approval rating is anchored around 40 per cent, fed up Republicans are desperate for a presidential candidate who can appeal to swing voters and deliver what Trump has long and loudly boasted but quite clearly can no longer deliver: victory at the ballot box.</p> <p>Trump’s ability to control Republican primary voters and lawmakers has always been the key to his political power.</p> <p>I saw this loyalty on full display on January 6, 2021, standing in the doorway of the Capitol as the angry mob smashed their way into the hallways of power, trashing everything in their path.</p> <p>“Today is not the end, it’s just the beginning!” the president bellowed to his furious supporters, before the madness began.</p> <p>In the early hours of the following morning, watching the National Guard erect a fence around the US Capitol Building through tear-gassed, bloodshot eyes, I was convinced it was, in fact, the beginning of the end of Trump. His die-hard fan base was unhinged enough to scale the walls of the Capitol, but it’s a long way from an electoral majority.</p> <p>Two years on, Trump’s approval rating among Republicans is at its lowest point since he announced his first presidential bid in 2015.</p> <p>“Appearing to be weak and a loser is kryptonite for the man who built his political Superman persona around winning,” warns legendary Republican strategist Mike Murphy.</p> <p>Sixty-one per cent of GOP voters surveyed in a <em>USA Today</em>/Suffolk University poll said they would prefer a different candidate to pursue Trump’s conservative policies over the next two years, with two-thirds backing <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/why-ron-desantis-has-become-the-man-donald-trump-should-fear-the-most-20221110-p5bx72.html\" target=\"_blank\">Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as the man for the job.</a></p> <p>“There were people around Rasputin who said he can never be killed, until they brought a big enough gun,” Murphy points out.</p> <p>Murphy, who advised John McCain, Jeb Bush and Arnold Schwarzenegger, predicts Trump will realise he can’t win a general election by the end of 2023, and will instead try to dictate who wins the Republican Party nomination.</p> <p>“That way, he’ll get all the media attention with much less risk of political embarrassment,” Murphy says.</p> <p>Given the US federal justice system shies away from investigating presidential candidates, Trump’s early announcement to run in 2024 is likely as much a legal strategy as a political one.</p> <p>Twice impeached – facing a raft of investigations into his family business, alleged interference in the 2020 presidential election, and potential criminal prosecution for his role in the Capitol insurrection – it seems reality might finally be catching up with the TV star.</p> <p>Murphy likens the American legal system to lava: slow moving, but “fundamentally unstoppable”.</p> <p>Trump will eventually have his day in court, it’s just a question of whether he’ll be charged in any number of investigations before 2024.</p> <p>Those hoping to see the New York billionaire standing in line for prison slop wearing an orange jumpsuit may be disappointed. Even if convicted, it’s unlikely that Trump will be watching the election coverage from a jail cell. He’ll more likely be locked up in a “bungalow on an air force base somewhere in North Dakota” predicts Murphy. It’s still an extraordinary image to ponder: a former US president behind bars – a fate even Richard Nixon avoided.</p> <p>Trump’s political death throes, like the man himself, have been dramatic and often cringeworthy. The most recent, billed as a “major announcement” by Team Trump, was the launch of Digital Trading Cards showcasing the 76-year-old in various avatars including a superhero and NASCAR driver. The non-fungible tokens initially sold out in less than a day, but in the past week have lost more than 70 per cent of their value.</p> <p>His stocks are plummeting across the board.</p> <p>Without the support of the GOP, and with the feds circling, 2023 may well be the year The Donald finally dances – or is dragged – off stage, for good.</p> <p><b><i>The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own. </i></b><b><i>Sign up here</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

But what does it represent when private schools have paid supplements in the media advertising their elite facilities and programs? That’s divisive.</p> <p>Creating and reinforcing advantage means there is inevitably a disadvantaged group. One only has to read school brochures to see how private schools (rich and poor) reinforce their difference from public state schools. That’s divisive. Admittedly not all private schools are wealthy but they extol their differences such as religious ethos. That’s divisive.</p> <p>They are not for profit community services, so should pay tax like those organisations. A very small number of private schools share their facilities and curriculum options. That’s to be encouraged. I look forward to seeing more kids from local public schools sharing the facilities at Xavier, St Leonard’s and Geelong Grammar.<br/><strong>Rosita Vila, Aireys Inlet</strong></p> <p><strong>Imagine a single, properly funded system</strong><br/>Jacinta Collins puts the argument for not removing the payroll tax exemption from Catholic schools. So much time and ink is spent on arguing for a fair mechanism for funding our schools and whether one change or another benefits one sector – private or public – over the other. This only happens because we have a two-tier system. Imagine if we just had one secular, publicly funded school system that was properly funded and where children of different religious denominations and social classes could mix and hopefully better learn to understand and live together.</p> <p>Schools should not exacerbate wealth and class divisions in our society. Religion is a private matter that surely can be addressed by families and religious organisations outside the classroom. I know it won’t happen any time soon, but hopefully one day we will have one school system, and the arguments will focus on the skills and knowledge future generations will need for the significant challenges ahead.<br/><strong>Jenny Macmillan, Clifton Hill</strong></p> <p><strong>A budget mismatch</strong><br/>Twenty three years ago my total school budget for 250 primary children was approximately $1.3 million. Twenty minutes up the road a private school was charging $20,000 per year. So, ultimately, the private school had an extra $5 million in their budget each year.</p> <p>My school each had on average about 20 children in grade one who were identified at risk. Because we shared a psychologist with 10 other primary schools we were lucky if we had four of those children assessed each year. Up the road they had employed a permanent full time psychologist.<br/>Extra support personnel for children at risk meant that there wasn’t enough funds to employ a physical education teacher. Up the road not only did they have PE teachers but they also employed an ex-AFL player to coach their footy team. Our swimming program was restricted as we shared the local outdoor pool. Up the road the children had access to a heated indoor pool. Our successful chess team (made state finals each year) was coached by a volunteer, an invalid pensioner. Up the road they employed an ex-grand master to coach their team. Our school band borrowed instruments from the Salvation Army, while the private school had a modern performing centre and high country camp.</p> <p>In 2012 the Gonski school funding review recommended that to improve school results the government should allocate funding on a needs base. More than a decade later and according to analysis by Greenwell and Bonner (Waiting for Gonski) we have much greater inequality in school funding. PISA results from 2012 to 2021 show a decline in the way Australian 15 year olds are performing.</p> <p>How can anyone justify providing government funding to high-fee schools when the most of the children at risk of failing are in a government schools. Imagine the outcry if the AFL stopped their funding equalisation and North Melbourne were required to operate on a budget a 10th of Collingwood?<br/><strong>Kevin Brown, Moonlight Flat</strong></p> <h3>THE FORUM</h3> <p><strong>Two sides to the story</strong><br/>Jacinta Collins says the state government’s payroll tax initiative is divisive. If you want to see real division, take a tour of some public schools, including those in regional areas, and then through those elite private institutions bloated with a combination of parents fortunate enough to be able to pay, mega alumni money and considerable taxpayer contributions from those who are unable to even contemplate sending their children there.<br/><strong>Craig Jory, Albury, NSW</strong></p> <p><strong>Doing more with less</strong><br/>Australia’s school system spends much more than it needs to. The Schools Resource Standard indicates the level of per student funding a school needs to ensure most students are achieving above minimum standards in NAPLAN. The per student gross income per student in many private schools is well over twice the standard amount.</p> <p>Much of this is redirected to capital projects of sometimes questionable educational value in a competition for clients. We would have a much cheaper school system overall if our governments fully funded all schools to the Schools Resource Standards, on condition that they did not charge fees. This is the situation in countries like Canada whose students perform significantly better on international tests. We would also have a less segregated and more equitable system befitting the country of the fair go.<br/><strong>Lawrence Ingvarson, Canterbury</strong></p> <p><strong>Setting the standard</strong><br/>“Schools can’t be treated like businesses,” Collins writes (“Stop stereotyping private schools”, 15/6). Maybe private schools shouldn’t act like businesses.<br/><strong>James Lane, Hampton East</strong></p> <p><strong>Moderates losing out</strong><br/><em>The Age</em> headline “Pesutto’s Coalition sinks to a new low in the polls” (15/6) would have been more accurate had it stated: “Support for the Liberals sinks to a new low.” As a rare moderate in today’s Liberal Party, Pesutto is like a shag on a rock as the party moves to the right.</p> <p>Pesutto’s treatment by his Liberal colleagues echoes that of the late Malcolm Fraser, when John Howard initiated the Liberals’ transformation into a party that elected the likes of Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison to its leadership. The fact is that moderates no longer have a place in the contemporary Liberal Party. Prior to his untimely death, Fraser proposed that there was a need for a new party guided by genuinely liberal-conservative principles. It’s time to resurrect this idea.<br/><strong>Allan Patience, Newport</strong></p> <p><strong>Safety upgrades</strong><br/>Two horrific bus crashes have occurred in Australia within a month. The devastating impact of these incidents will have long-lasting repercussions for the passengers and bus drivers, their families, communities and the emergency services and hospital staff involved. The coverage of these events has been heart wrenching. It has also shaken my confidence in the inherent safety of bus travel. Is it not time to address the issues and fallibilities surrounding airbags for bus passengers and the design and mandatory wearing of seatbelts by passengers on buses?<br/><strong>Wilga Kottek, Main Ridge</strong></p> <p><strong>Whose safety comes first?</strong><br/>Our politicians do love their three-word slogans. Listening to Victoria’s minister for roads and road safety during budget estimates on Wednesday, it’s about people being able to move about “safely and efficiently”. But apparently this concern is mainly about people moving about in motor vehicles.<br/>Those of us who want to move about by walking, cycling or using public transport usually need to choose between safety and efficiency. People wanting to cross busy roads safely often need to add some distance to their journey to reach a safe pedestrian crossing. Cyclists often have to take a circuitous route to reach one of the few safe cycling paths. And people wanting the safe option of public transport often have to endure long travel times due to infrequent, indirect services.<br/>And the upshot of this bias towards people moving about in motor vehicles? More people choosing to drive, making the roads less safe and less efficient for everyone.<br/><strong>Andrea Bunting, Brunswick</strong></p> <p><strong>The cost of development</strong><br/>One reason we are not able to improve our productivity is that we are often, and increasingly, stuck in traffic jams as soon as we leave our homes. Our taxes are being turned into concrete, with hugely expensive infrastructure projects aimed at reducing future congestion. We are unlikely to make up for the extra time we have spent slowing down for road works over the last few years, and with continuing rapid population growth, the new roads will fill up with more traffic in no time so we are really no better off.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we don’t have enough resources for the services that really matter – aged care, healthcare, housing, public education, social support, and environmental protection.<br/><strong>Jennie Epstein, Little River</strong></p> <p><strong>One track mind</strong><br/>The federal government has appointed a fast train authority for trains between capital cities. Without major political support and new thinking, this idea will get no further than it has in the past 40 years. The less infrastructure we build the more bespoke each project becomes, meaning each is dearer and takes longer. We currently build roads everywhere and subsidise truck transport by not charging for the disproportionate road wear from trucks.</p> <p>There is however one country that has built more fast trains than the rest of the world put together in the past 15 years. It is also building such projects in neighbouring countries. It now has the expertise, labour and manufacturing system to build, ship and install all the rails, bridges, rolling stock and assorted equipment quickly and cheaply. Would we consider the fast train world leaders building some for us?<br/><strong>Mark Freeman, Macleod</strong></p> <p><strong>A national freeze</strong><br/>The federal $10 billion Australia Housing Future Fund legislation is being blocked in the Senate. The Greens want $2.5 billion for public and affordable housing from this year and $1 billion to help co-ordinate a national freeze on rent increases, joining forces with the LNP to block legislation. So what else do they have in common? They all go home to warm beds and a roof over their heads.<br/><strong>Gary Roulston, Endeavour Hills</strong></p> <p><strong>We all lose</strong><br/>Reading Shaun Carney (“Voice raises doubts over PM’s skill”, 15/23) I felt an enormous sense of sadness and shame that Peter Dutton has chosen to turn the Voice debate into a win or lose situation between our white leaders. Anthony Albanese’s campaign skills should have nothing to do with the success of this referendum.</p> <p>Human rights, empathy and hope for our nation should determine the success of this once-in-a-lifetime chance to right the wrongs of the past.<br/><strong>Marilyn Hoban, Mornington</strong></p> <p><strong>Why I’m saying No</strong><br/>I’ve decided to vote No in the forthcoming referendum. My main reason is that we are all now fortunate to live in a free, democratic and largely prosperous country. We all originated from somewhere in Africa so all of our ancestors came from somewhere else. Some of this involved invasion and inhumane treatment of earlier settlers. But we are now all Australians.</p> <p>Isn’t the very idea of one group having more of a voice than others undemocratic? This is not to say that Indigenous people should not be recognised by an amendment to the Constitution that acknowledges they were indeed the original occupants of a land that now presents benefits to all its inhabitants.<br/><strong>Ken Barnes, Glen Iris</strong></p> <p><strong>Truth-telling first</strong><br/>The Voice is top-down, paternalistic, complex, opportunity-intensive for politicians – and ineffectual except for an increase in white complacency: “look what we’ve done for you”. But it’s like trying to decorate the house before the foundations are laid.</p> <p>Truth-telling or restorative justice, is from the ground up, confronting, nation changing, destructive of our colonial complacency and administratively simple, with no room for politicians. So for Canberra, the choice was easy. But truth-telling should be first — otherwise how do we know what we’re voting for?<br/><strong>John Laurie, Riddells Creek</strong></p> <p><strong>We need a guarantee</strong><br/>Your correspondent’s suggestion to reboot and redistribute re the referendum (Letters, 14/6) is a short-term solution to a long-term issue. If political parties could be trusted to do the right thing by our Indigenous colleagues then it could be workable but only a constitutional guarantee can give them the support they need (and deserve).<br/><strong>Leah Billeam, Portarlington</strong></p> <p><strong>They deserve your trust</strong><br/>A Voice that can “be legislated any time without a referendum” is a Voice that can be eliminated any time. Removing the words “and the executive government” strips the Voice of its most effective means of achieving practical change – which is why the Voice has been proposed in the first case.<br/>Don’t ask for the Voice to change, ask what you can do to trust and understand the Voice so you can support it to succeed. Read the submissions to the Senate inquiry into the history of its evolution and proposed wording. Understand the gap for what it is – a stubbornly persistent inequality in health and wellbeing in Australian society, whose seeds lie not in a difference in race or culture, but rather in the First Nations people’s experience of colonisation. Ask how we can “undo” the legacy of colonisation and improve lives.</p> <p>What does it mean if you cannot trust the majority of First Nations Australians who support the Voice to know what’s best for themselves, and then support them to achieve it?<br/><strong>Giselle Darling, Fitzroy North</strong></p> <h3>AND ANOTHER THING</h3> <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong><br/>Single-handedly Trump, supported by his unreflective followers, has made abuse, lying, misogyny, etc. into a positive political quality.<br/><strong>Barrie Bales, Woorinen North</strong></p> <p>As Trump’s behaviour worsens, his popularity seems to grow.

       "   'description': '<p>Just seven weeks after the storming of the Capitol, Donald Trump attended a conservative conference in Orlando, Florida, that felt more like a cult conclave.</p> <p>Gathered under the palm trees outside, flora that seemed fittingly apostolic, his supporters cheered proudly when a mobile billboard was driven past illuminated with what was meant to be a trolling taunt: “January 6th Reunion.”</p> <p>On gleaming display inside was a golden statue of Donald Trump, featuring the former president in a pair of Stars and Stripes swim shorts, a garish icon which looked like the 1980s had thrown up all over it. Trump as tacky godhead.</p> <p>Delivering his first speech since leaving the White House, Trump made his triumphant entrance on the Sunday of the conference, which in this quasi-religious setting made his reappearance feel even more like a resurrection. By then it had become clear, however, that January 6 had not brought about his political death. Mar-a-Lago, his rococo Florida mansion, should have become his Elba, a place of banishment. Yet the Republican Party remained the church of Donald Trump.</p> <p>His arraignment in New York, where the former president will face the ignominy of having his fingerprints taken, and his mugshot recorded for posterity, will fuel the messiah complex combined with the martyrdom fixation at the heart of Trumpism.</p> <p>Allies are already describing him as a political prisoner – even though he has been merely charged rather than convicted – and wallowing in their usual sense of victimhood that liberal America is out to get them. Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News outrage machine has gone into overdrive, its most profitable gear. But prosecutors are undertaking what Republican leaders have been too spineless to do: finally holding Trump to account.</p> <p>America’s 45th president was the leader of the January 6 insurrection, the huckster who came up with a blackmail scheme to trade US military aid to Ukraine for political dirt on Joe Biden, the white nationalist who claimed America’s first black president was not American, the nativist who thought a good way of deterring immigrants from crossing the Mexican border was to build an alligator moat also stocked with venomous snakes, and the wannabe authoritarian who asked the Pentagon, at the height of the George Floyd protests, why protesters could not simply be shot in the legs. Despite this rap sheet, he has been aided and abetted throughout by Republican leaders who have repeatedly displayed profiles in utter cowardice.</p> <p>On the very night of January 6, well over half of Republican lawmakers returned to chambers that had been invaded hours before by insurrectionists and voted to overturn the election, thus carrying on his attack on democracy.</p> <p>When Democrats impeached Trump for an unprecedented second time, 45 Republican senators voted to dismiss the case immediately so that he would not have to face trial in the Senate, even though some of them had to run for their lives on January 6. At the end of his impeachment trial, only seven out of 50 Republicans voted to convict, and not one member of the Republican leadership.</p> <p>As soon as the trial concluded, Mitch McConnell delivered a reproachful speech, calling Trump “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day”. These, however, were weasel words – he indicated shortly afterwards his willingness to support the former president if he emerged as the party’s 2024 nominee.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of January 6, Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy told colleagues he was thinking of calling Trump to tell him to resign. But he never summoned up the courage to do so, and soon after, he flew to Mar-a-Lago, where again he became Trump’s supplicant.</p> <p>Fearful of alienating the MAGA faithful, and motivated always by a blind hatred of their Democrat opponents, leaders who could and should have repudiated Trump have helped in his rehabilitation.</p> <p>Even after the revelations that Trump had been informed by the Secret Service beforehand that his MAGA mob had turned up in Washington on January 6 with an arsenal of weaponry, they have remained his enablers. In response to Trump’s indictment, McCarthy instantly took aim at Alvin Bragg, the African-American prosecutor, and Democrat, claiming he had “irreparably damaged our country in an attempt to interfere in our presidential election” – words which surely are more applicable to Trump, or, for that matter, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Over the course of its 247-year history, America has seen demagogues reach the White House. It has witnessed presidents, such as Richard Nixon, with authoritarian impulses. In president Andrew Jackson, Trump’s populist soulmate, the demagogic and the authoritarian came together. However, presidents who have abused their power have been reined in, not just by the Constitution, but also by members of their own party.</p> <p>As the Watergate crisis reached its denouement, a delegation of senior Republicans told Nixon he had to resign. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to pack an obstructive Supreme Court with justices who would back his New Deal program, he was blocked by fellow Democrats alarmed by what they saw as a dictatorial power grab.</p> <p>This safeguard, in a system based on norms as well as rules and laws, has been crucial down the ages. But in the Trump years that protection has so often been absent.</p> <p>His vice-president Mike Pence bravely defied Trump on January 6, by rejecting the ludicrous suggestion that he could unilaterally overturn the presidential election on the day that Congress certified the results. But Republican leaders should have made that abundantly clear weeks earlier. Their craven reticence allowed the “Big Lie” to metastasise into such monstrous proportions.</p> <p>Trump now faces his day in court. As for his Republican backers, history will be the judge.</p> <p><b><i>Get a note directly from our foreign </i></b><b><i>correspondents </i></b><b><i>on what’s making headlines around the world. </i></b><b><i>Sign up for the weekly What in the World newsletter here</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>On November 19, 1919, the US Senate repudiated the Versailles Treaty. With that decision, the US withdrew its might from maintaining what had been agreed in the aftermath of World War I, leaving this task to the British and French, who lacked both the will and the means to do so.</p> <p>World War II followed. After that conflict, the US played a far more productive role. Today, the world is still in many ways the one the US made. But for how much longer will that be the case? And what might follow it? The outcome of the next presidential election might answer these questions, not just decisively, but, alas, very badly.</p> <p>Recent polls suggest that almost 55 per cent of US voters disapprove of Joe Biden’s performance. They also suggest that Donald Trump is slightly ahead of Biden in head-to-head polling before the election now a year away.</p> <p>Finally, they suggest that Trump is ahead of Biden in five of the six most important “battleground” states. In all, a Trump victory is clearly and disturbingly plausible.</p> <p>What would that mean? The most important answer is that the US, not just the world’s most powerful democracy, but its saviour in the 20th century, is no longer committed to democratic norms.</p> <p>The most fundamental of such norms is that power has to be won in free and fair elections. Whether US presidential elections are “fair” is debatable. But they do have rules. Efforts by the incumbent to overthrow those rules amount to insurrection. That Trump attempted to do so is not debatable.</p> <p>Neither is the absence of evidence of fraud to support his attempted coup. He is properly under indictment. Yet he might still win a presidential election. One reason why he might do so is that close to 70 per cent of people who identify as Republicans say they believe his lies. This is shocking, though, alas, not that surprising.</p> <p>What would another Trump presidency mean for the US, beyond an endorsement of a man who attempted to overthrow the constitution? Obviously, the answer would depend partly on the balance in Congress.</p> <p>Yet, it would be wrong to draw additional comfort from how he behaved last time. Then, he relied on quite traditional figures from the military and business. Next time will be different. “Maga” is now a cult with a sizeable number of believers.</p> <p>A crucial domestic plan of Trump’s is to replace the career civil service with loyal servants of the president. The excuse is the alleged existence of a “deep state”, by which critics mean knowledgeable career civil servants whose loyalty is to the law and the state, not to the person in power.</p> <p>One reason this is objectionable is that modern government cannot run without such people. The bigger reason is that if the intelligence, homeland security and internal revenue services, the military, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice are subservient to the whims of the head of state, one has autocracy.</p> <p>Yes, it’s that simple. With a vengeful head of state, abuses of power could be pervasive. This would not be the US we have known. It might be more like Viktor Orban’s Hungary or even Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey.</p> <h2>The US must lead</h2> <p>What might this mean for the world?</p> <p>Most obviously, embrace by the US of a man and a party that have openly repudiated the central norm of liberal democracy would dishearten those who believe in it and encourage despots and their lackeys everywhere. It is hard to exaggerate the effect of such a betrayal by the US.</p> <p>The mixture of this despair with Trump’s avowedly transactional approach would weaken, if not destroy, the trust on which current US alliances are based. Americans are right to decry the free riding of most allies. There is no doubt, above all, that Europeans (among which the UK is included) must do more.</p> <p>But the alliance needs a leader. For the foreseeable future, the US has to be that leader. With Russia threatening Europe, and China a peer competitor, alliances are going to be more important than ever – not just for its allies, but for the US, too. Trump neither understands nor cares about this.</p> <p>Then there are the implications for the world economy. Trump is proposing to introduce a 10 per cent across-the-board tariff on all imports. This would be a contemporary (albeit milder) version of the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930. It would surely lead to retaliation. It would also do huge damage to the World Trade Organisation, by repudiating US commitments to lower tariff barriers over many decades.</p> <p>As important is likely to be the impact on efforts to tackle climate change. The US itself would presumably reverse many measures in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. As significant might be a likely US withdrawal from efforts to promote investment in clean energy in emerging and developing countries.<br/>Prospective relations with China must also be in question. Here the changes might not be that dramatic because hostility to China’s rise is bipartisan.</p> <p>But the opposition to China would be less about ideology under Trump, who cares not a whit about such differences between autocracies and democracies. He rather prefers the former. It would become just a contest over power, with Trump trying to keep the US number one. How differently that would turn out is unclear. Trump might seek to turn Russia against China, as Nixon did China against the Soviet Union. Abandonment of Ukraine might be his bait.</p> <p>A second Trump presidency might not ruin the US forever. But both it and the rest of the world would lose their innocence. We would have to adapt to the reality that the US had re-elected a man who had openly tried to subvert its democracy. It is possible that the indictments against Trump will save the day. But that fragile hope highlights today’s threat to democracy.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong>London: </strong>Leading US pollster Frank Luntz says Donald Trump can re-win the presidency and that if that happens, US democracy could collapse.</p> <p>Speaking to this masthead in London, where he was a guest speaker at the Centre for Policy Studies’ Margaret Thatcher conference, Luntz said he was wrong to declare in <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/donald-trump-will-never-be-president-again-says-renowned-pollster-frank-luntz-20211009-p58yna.html\" target=\"_blank\">2021 that Trump would never again be president</a>.</p> <p>“I now have to acknowledge that it is a distinct possibility that Donald Trump could be elected president – I did not believe that one year ago,” he said.</p> <p>“I did not believe that the search of Mar-a-Lago would be handled so badly, I did not believe that the indictment of him in New York would be handled so badly.</p> <p>“I did not believe that his opponents would be so inept as to actually strengthen him and the combination of all of those makes him now viable, not just in the Republican primary but in the general election.”</p> <p>Luntz said US democracy could collapse if Trump was reinstated by the American people.</p> <p>“It’s now conceivable that in 2024 the country comes apart,” he said. “We have a 15 per cent likelihood of that destroying American democracy depending on what happens.”</p> <p>“NATO is in jeopardy, clearly. Ukraine will no longer receive American support. Our legal system will be in jeopardy – I don’t want to contemplate it.”</p> <p>He denied he was exaggerating and said comparisons to the United States surviving civil war were irrelevant in modern times.</p> <p>“Everything that I would have [previously] said to you was impossible is actually happening,” Luntz said.</p> <p>“It was never conceivable before, just as January 6 wasn’t conceivable, just as the election day wasn’t conceivable, just as Roe v Wade being overturned wasn’t conceivable.</p> <p>“The Roman Empire could never fall until it fell, the sun never set on the British Empire until it came apart, the Greeks created civilisation and now look where Greece is.”</p> <p>Luntz said the reason US democracy was so frail was because truth was now contested and no longer about agreed-upon facts. That means people consume news to affirm their own views rather than be informed, he said.</p> <p>“Democracies can survive negativity and they can survive division,” he said. “They cannot survive rejection of the truth because in the end, the foundation of democracy is knowing the truth, that’s how voters vote correctly.</p> <p>“The moment you stop seeking the truth and start rejecting it, actively, that’s the moment when you lose this wonderful system of government, and we are there right now.”</p> <p>Luntz said Trump was weaponising the various court proceedings against him to fashion himself as being persecuted rather than prosecuted.</p> <p>“He actually knows the language of victimisation better than any politician I’ve seen anywhere across the globe, and he uses it effectively and has caused people to rally around him.</p> <p>“So he’s actually stronger today under two indictments, being found guilty of sexual assault, he’s actually politically stronger today than he was one year ago.”</p> <p>Former US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina, former vice-president Mike Pence and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum are all hoping to beat Trump for the Republican nomination.</p> <p>DeSantis is considered the candidate capable of posing the greatest threat to Trump, but Luntz identified Scott as having the best prospects of beating Biden.</p> <p>“If Tim Scott gets the nomination he’s absolutely beating Joe Biden without any hesitation,” Luntz said.</p> <h3>Americans care about affordability, not the economy</h3> <p>Luntz said Biden was vulnerable and weaker than when he defeated Trump in 2020 because he had embarked on too much government spending that had added to the cost of living.</p> <p>He said voters were no longer making decisions on issues but on attributes relating to the cost of living.</p> <p>“They want certainty, predictability and security – against the next COVID virus, against the next economic collapse, against inflation, and by the way it’s not the economy that matters most or even inflation; it’s affordability,” he said.</p> <p>“And they do not believe that Joe Biden’s succeeding in this area to a great degree.”</p> <p>He predicted that the British Conservative Party would hemorrhage previously-held Labor seats they won under Boris Johnson in 2016 because voters were loyal to Johnson and not the Conservatives.</p> <p>Johnson quit parliament on Monday, accusing a parliamentary inquiry investigating the parties held in Number 10 during COVID lockdowns of forcing him out in an anti-democratic witch hunt.</p> <p>While British voters turned on the former prime minister for putting himself above the people, Luntz said this had not happened to Trump in the US.</p> <p>“This is something that Trump has clearly done, but they forgive him for it, which is what I don’t understand [and] which is why I’m particularly nervous about the state of politics in America,” he said.</p> <p><b><i>Get a note directly from our foreign </i></b><b><i>correspondents </i></b><b><i>on what’s making headlines around the world. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56l7u\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Sign up for the weekly What in the World newsletter here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><b>New York: </b>A New York judge on Friday fined Donald Trump $US5000 ($7920) for violating a gag order barring the former US president from disparaging court staff during his civil fraud trial, warning that any future transgressions would bring “far more severe” sanctions including imprisonment.</p> <p>Justice Arthur Engoron said a Trump social media post attacking the judge’s clerk – which was later deleted from the former president’s Truth Social platform – had remained visible on his 2024 campaign website two weeks after an order was issued to take it down.</p> <p>The judge noted that the gag order violation appeared inadvertent, but added: “Make no mistake: future violations, whether intentional or unintentional, will subject the violator to far more severe sanctions.”</p> <p>Those sanctions, the judge said, could include steeper fines and possible imprisonment.</p> <p>Engoron is presiding over the trial on civil charges brought by New York state Attorney-General Letitia James accusing Trump of unlawfully inflating his net worth to dupe lenders.</p> <p>Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in next year’s US election, holding a commanding lead over his rivals despite mounting legal troubles and court-ordered restrictions on his public statements.</p> <p>Engoron imposed a limited gag order on October 3 after Trump in a social media post shared a photo of the judge’s top clerk posing with US Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, a critic of the former president, and called her the senator’s “girlfriend”.</p> <p>The judge in imposing the gag order said that comments directed at his staff were “unacceptable, inappropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstances”.</p> <p>Trump at times has appeared in person at the ongoing trial, attacking James and Engoron in inflammatory remarks to reporters outside of the courtroom.</p> <p>The lawsuit by James accused Trump of inflating the values of his properties by billions of dollars in statements to banks, reaping hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten savings on loan interest. Trump is also accused of manipulating asset values to dupe insurers.</p> <p>Trump, who has sought to portray the case as intended to hurt him politically, has denied wrongdoing and defended his asset valuations. He has said banks conducted their own due diligence and profited on the loans.</p> <p>The trial, which began three weeks ago, has centred on reams of emails and financial documents detailing how Trump’s companies valued their properties.</p> <p>Lawyers for the attorney general’s office have sought to show that those valuations were arbitrarily inflated to satisfy Trump’s desire for a high net worth. Trump’s attorney have argued they were reasonable and based on his real estate expertise.</p> <p>Trump faces criminal charges in four other cases involving his efforts to undo his loss in the 2020 election, his handling of classified documents after leaving office and hush money paid to a porn star. Trump has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty in those cases. He also faces a January civil damages trial for defaming a writer who accused him of rape, which he denies.</p> <p>On October 17, a federal judge in Washington overseeing a federal case accusing Trump of illegally attempting to overturn his 2020 defeat barred Trump from making public statements that “target” US prosecutors, court staff and potential witnesses involved in the case.</p> <p>Trump is appealing that order.</p> <p><strong>Reuters</strong></p> <p><b><i>Get a note directly from our foreign </i></b><b><i>correspondents </i></b><b><i>on what’s making headlines around the world. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56l7u\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Sign up for the weekly What in the World newsletter here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Trump warned of possible indictment over attack on Capitol',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><em>Washington</em> | Former president Donald Trump is facing a possible second federal indictment after receiving a so-called target letter from the special counsel, <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/trump-s-case-puts-the-justice-system-on-trial-20230611-p5dfmc\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Smith</a>, in connection with the criminal investigation into Mr Trump’s efforts to hold on to power after he lost the 2020 election.</p> <p>It was not clear what aspects of the sprawling investigation the letter may be related to. The investigation has examined an array of schemes that Mr Trump and his allies had used to try to stave off defeat, including the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, riot by his supporters at the Capitol.</p> <p>The letter was the second from Mr Smith notifying Mr Trump that he is a target in a federal investigation. The first, in June, was in connection to the inquiry into Mr Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/the-one-person-trump-needs-for-acquittal-20230614-p5dgcj\" target=\"_blank\">handling of national defence material</a> after he left office and his alleged obstruction of efforts to retrieve it.</p> <p>Days after that letter became public, Mr Trump was charged with 37 criminal counts covering seven different violations of federal law.</p> <p>Mr Trump disclosed his receipt of the latest target letter in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, that assailed Mr Smith, calling him “deranged”. He wrote that he had received the letter on Sunday and been given four days to report to a grand jury – an invitation he is expected to decline.</p> <p>Mr Smith’s office declined to comment. White House officials also declined to comment, citing a decision by President Joe Biden, who could face Mr Trump in a 2024 rematch, to keep Justice Department investigations independent.</p> <p>The former president spent weeks after the 2020 election publicly insisting that he had won and looking for ways to remain in power, at one point considering whether to use the apparatus of government to seize voting machines.</p> <p>Ultimately, he encouraged a crowd at a rally near the White House to march to the Capitol as Mr Biden’s electoral victory was being certified. Members of the mob stormed the building, some chanting “Hang Mike Pence!” and others hunting for then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p> <p>Federal grand juries in Washington have been hearing evidence in the criminal investigation into Mr Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss. That suggests that any charges would be tried in the nation’s capital, where the Justice Department has won guilty pleas or convictions in hundreds of cases related to the assault on the Capitol.</p> <p>Mr Trump disclosed the existence of the letter on Tuesday morning (Wednesday AEST) after a news inquiry into whether he had been told he was a target of the investigation. “Deranged Jack Smith, the prosecutor with Joe Biden’s DOJ, sent a letter (again, it was Sunday night!) stating that I am a TARGET of the January 6th Grand Jury investigation, and giving me a very short 4 days to report to the Grand Jury, which almost always means an Arrest and Indictment,” he wrote on Truth Social.</p> <p>A target letter is an official piece of correspondence from the Justice Department informing a person that they are actively being investigated.</p> <p>Congressional Republicans defended Mr Trump, saying he was being unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Other candidates for the party’s 2024 presidential nomination also defended him, but in notably muted ways.</p> <p>Mr Smith, who was appointed in November to investigate Mr Trump, is a hard-driving former prosecutor chosen for his experience in bringing high-stakes cases against politicians in the United States and abroad.</p> <p>The January 6 investigation is just one of several inquiries involving Mr Trump at the state and federal levels.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18/us/politics/trump-jan-6-letter.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>With Joe Biden confirming that he is seeking a second term as US president and Donald Trump’s main Republican competitor, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, seeking a second term at a national level, it appears a repeat of the 2020 US presidential contest is the most likely scenario.</p> <p>For many Americans, it seems beggars can’t be choosers. A recent poll found that 60 per cent believe Trump should stay out of the race, while 70 per cent think Biden should also step aside. There are sound arguments for both candidates to forgo another run.</p> <p>While there is little evidence that Biden’s age is currently impeding his ability to carry out his presidential duties, a second term would break his own record as the oldest person to be sworn in as president aged 78. If he were to secure another four years, Biden would be well into his 80s by the time he handed over the nuclear codes.</p> <p>When you cast your mind back to the previous two Democrat presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, not to mention John F. Kennedy, they all took office in their mid-40s. Youth may not be the defining measure of political acumen, but it’s surely legitimate to ask whether Biden’s advancing years would hamper his ability to campaign and continue carrying out his presidential duties. It also begs the question why there is such a dearth of new leadership talent within the Democrat party, allowing Biden to seek a second term uncontested.</p> <p>On the Trump side, the list of alleged misdeeds appears to grow by the week.</p> <p>He is the first former president facing criminal charges over hush payments related to an alleged sexual tryst with a porn star, is currently facing criminal charges over accusations of raping a woman in the mid-1990s, is being investigated for his handling of sensitive government documents after he left office and his attempts to interfere with the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia, and New York’s attorney-general is accusing him of facing criminal charges by billions of dollars. And then, let’s not forget, his role in the January 6 riots on the Capitol building.</p> <p>For any normal candidate, any one of those accusations or actions would have forced them out of contention. As it should.</p> <p>But Trump continues to defy the usual rules of politics. As only Trump can do, he is fending off the multiple investigations and accusations by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/15/trump-fundraising-indictment-data-00092176\" target=\"_blank\">turning them into fundraising opportunities</a>, allowing him to build an election war chest and solidifying his position as the leading Republican candidate.</p> <p>Every period in history has its challenges, but the next decade appears particularly burdensome. The existential crisis brought on by our warming planet, the rapidly growing geopolitical tensions triggered by China’s rise as a major global power, and Russia’s willingness to use brute force in a bid to quash a neighbouring country’s national sovereignty are all crises that will have devastating global consequences if not managed in an effective and peaceful manner.</p> <p>Whoever sits in the White House in coming years will have a considerable say in how these issues are resolved. The world needs American leadership to buttress a world order that respects democracy and national sovereignty, promotes economic cooperation and plays an active role in reducing carbon emissions.</p> <p>It would be difficult to argue that Trump could offer such leadership. His past actions, and present-day pronouncements, would have us believe quite the opposite. While Biden has shown himself adept at salvaging America’s reputation abroad, it is still a nation deeply divided at home. A rerun of the acrimonious presidential election of 2020 would not seem an ideal means of offering the country a way forward.</p> <p><b><i>Patrick Elligett sends an exclusive newsletter to subscribers each week. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56l88\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Sign up to receive his Note from the Editor</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': '‘From cotton to Congress’: Another Republican joins race, but Trump remains the frontrunner',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><strong>Washington</strong>: The field of Republican candidates hoping to beat Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential nomination is growing rapidly, with the only black Republican in the Senate declaring his candidacy days before Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and others are expected to follow.</p> <p>In a move that was warmly welcomed by Trump himself, Senator Tim Scott, from South Carolina – a rising star who is pitching himself as the candidate “the far left fears the most” – officially announced his campaign for the White House at a rally in North Charleston on Monday (US time).</p> <p>“Good luck to Senator Tim Scott in entering the Republican Primary Race,” Trump posted on his Truth Social website, using the opportunity to chide DeSantis.</p> <p>“It is rapidly loading up with lots of people, and Tim is a big step up from Ron DeSanctimonious, who is totally unelectable.”</p> <p>Scott, 57, is widely respected within the Republican Party, and his positive backstory about coming from a poor family that went from “Cotton to Congress” often contrasts with Trump’s narrative of “retribution” and a “destroyed” America.</p> <p>He now joins an ever-expanding list of Republican primary candidates that already includes Trump’s former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and conservative radio host Larry Elder.</p> <p>The race is likely to heat up even more within days when DeSantis and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie are expected to enter. Former vice president Mike Pence and former New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu are also considering taking on Trump for a shot at the White House.</p> <p>But with Trump the frontrunner for the nomination according to most polls, the growing number of rivals is likely to work in his favour if the party is unable to coalesce around one single alternative and his opponents end up splitting the anti-Trump vote.</p> <p>A similar result played out in 2016 when Trump defeated a fractured, multi-party field of candidates that included senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and moderate Republican John Kasich.</p> <p>After winning the nomination, Trump went on to defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election. He won despite the former secretary of state winning the popular vote, thanks to the quirks of America’s electoral college system.</p> <p>Speaking at a forum over the weekend, Clinton warned that while she didn’t believe Trump could beat President Joe Biden in a general election, “the electoral college is always a difficult outcome to predict”.</p> <p>Asked what might happen if Trump became president again, she replied: “It would be the end of democracy in the United States”.</p> <p>“The list of potential disastrous outcomes is longer than I have time to go over,” Clinton told the audience at the <em>Financial Times</em> Weekend Festival in Washington DC.</p> <p>“It’s why we can’t permit it to happen and why any sensible person who looks at that former president and says: “Oh, let’s do this again” needs an intervention – because he’s only gotten worse.”</p> <p>Tim Scott’s announcement once again puts the focus on South Carolina, the heavily black state that helped secure Biden’s presidential nomination in 2020.</p> <p>But his message often irks Democrats because it goes against the view that America has been a land of oppression for black and brown people.</p> <p>“Our party and our nation are standing at a time for choosing: Victimhood or victory?” he told a packed audience at Charleston Southern University on Monday.</p> <p>“Grievance or greatness? I choose freedom and hope and opportunity.”</p> <p>Scott was elected to Congress in 2010 but was nominated to run for the Senate two years later by Haley, another South Carolina local vying for the Republican nomination.</p> <p>As the first black Republican from South Carolina to serve in the Senate, Scott championed so-called Opportunity Zones, which incentivise private investment in the poorest communities, and was instrumental in a bill that made lynching a federal hate crime after George Floyd’s murder.</p> <p>“I’m the candidate the far left fears the most,” Scott said. “I disrupt their narrative. I threaten their control.”</p> <p>The senator has also amassed a massive $US22 million ($33 million) war chest for his campaign. However, whether it will help in the expected race against Trump and his main rival DeSantis is yet to be seen.</p> <p>According to the latest figures from <em>RealClearPolitics</em>, the former president has a commanding lead of 56.6 per cent against his Republican primary rivals. DeSantis, having not yet formally declared, has 19.4 per cent of the vote; Haley has 4.3 per cent and Scott has less than 2 per cent.</p> <p><b><i>Get a note directly from our foreign </i></b><b><i>correspondents </i></b><b><i>on what’s making headlines around the world. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56l7u\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Sign up for the weekly What in the World newsletter here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Donald Trump has hit a new low, even by his standards',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>There’s been a strange quality to the continuing tension in the air of American politics of late. On the surface, the usual things are happening – “usual” in this context means actions and statements by prominent politicians that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. But there’s something else going on as well.</p> <p>Donald Trump is making the biggest headlines, of course. He went on trial on Tuesday in a civil case, brought in New York, about what the state says are shady business practices by his various real estate companies. A judge last week ruled that the companies were guilty of a massive fraud – and took the organisation’s business licences away, a step so extreme that no one has as yet been able to fully grasp the implications of it. (If Trump owned a restaurant, it would be forced to close its doors; but it is not yet clear what happens when the business is owning and managing skyscraper office buildings.) The trial this week is to assess financial penalties.</p> <p>The case has clearly been on Trump’s mind, and his various speeches have taken on a dark cast. During a talk at a meeting of the California Republican Party in a suburb of Los Angeles, he paused at one point to mention Nancy Pelosi, the onetime democratic speaker of the House. He then said, feigning innocence, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR7LHOfSA_k\" target=\"_blank\">“How’s her husband doing, anybody know?”</a> This was a reference to a brutal and almost fatal beating Pelosi’s husband, then 82, received a year ago from a deranged Trump fan wielding a hammer. His smirking words were treated as a punchline by the audience. It was a new low, even for him.</p> <p>A new low, that is, until you consider <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/top-us-general-delivers-defence-of-democracy-in-farewell-address-20230930-p5e8qk\" target=\"_blank\">his remarks about General Mark Milley</a>, who he suggested was treasonous, noting that the death penalty might be in order. To be clear: Trump himself had named Milley as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. He thus joins the long list of Trump’s own appointees he has disowned and tried to discredit.</p> <p>But even in that context, the death penalty part stands out. Legal commentators have noticed that Milley may well be a witness in one of the several federal cases against Trump. Threatening witnesses when you are on trial is generally frowned upon in the US court system; accordingly, a new legal parlour game has emerged as experts debate whether or when a judge will take the steps that would ordinarily be taken about such activities, which might include a species of gag order or even the revocation of bail.</p> <p>Such violent talk is catching. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who is trying to out-Trump Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, went on a rant about illegal immigrants, who he said were carrying fentanyl into the US. Under his potential administration, DeSantis vowed that these people would be shot at the border. “Of course you use deadly force,” he said. “...<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXEvjRt8uRg\" target=\"_blank\"> They’re going to end up stone-cold dead</a>.” Whether border agents would shoot first and then look for the fentanyl, or wait to find the fentanyl and then shoot, wasn’t clear.</p> <p>Meanwhile, one of Trump’s most rabid Congressional supporters was getting into trouble. Lauren Boebert, a loose cannon from rural Colorado who spouts things about family values, was thrown out of a Denver theatre during a stage musical performance. The theatre said she’d been disruptive and was even vaping. The representative denied it … until CCTV footage from inside showed her vaping and being disruptive. Then more footage came out, in which you could plainly see Boebert and her date engaging in some not-very-family-friendly activities. (In the parlance of American high schoolers, Boebert’s date had rounded second and was heading fast toward third.)</p> <p>Trump’s trial will continue for weeks; his legal calendar is packed with even more serious criminal charges in 2024. Other Republican-induced chaos proceeds in Washington; the Republican-controlled House of Representatives nearly shut the government down this week. A temporary deal was made, but now the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, will have to fend off a pack of rabid attack dogs on his right, Lauren Boebert among them. In the balance: aid to Ukraine, an America ally under attack from one of America’s enemies.</p> <p>Yes, in a way this is more of the same. Many Americans seem to get off on the spectacle at this point. Sometimes it seems that democracy, and perhaps the liberal West, is at stake. But there’s an argument to be made that a lot of Americans don’t think all of this is desirable. There’s a real world out there, and no one in it thinks this is, or should be, normal. It’s possible what we’re seeing isn’t the effects of a growing movement of destructive force, but rather the shaking and rattling of a poorly built car whose doors and wheels are about to fall off.</p> <p><strong>Bill Wyman is a former assistant managing editor of National Public Radio, in Washington.

Last month those figures were at 57 per cent for Mr Trump and 12 per cent for Mr DeSantis.</p> <p>Mr Trump this week took to Truth Social to criticise media for not reporting the fresh polling data, which will build his argument for skipping the second Republican candidate debate on September 27 following his absence in the first one.</p> <p>“Why doesn’t Fox News, or the Globalist <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, put up the tremendous polls that are being released daily showing that I am up on their ‘candidate’, Ron DeSanctimonious, &amp; all of the others … by record type numbers,” he posted.</p> <p>Mr Trump’s legal woes seem to be providing the momentum.</p> <p>In the first few days after his arrest on charges surrounding his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Trump <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/trump-s-11m-mugshot-donors-boost-campaign-war-chest-20230827-p5dzr4\" target=\"_blank\">raised $US7.1 million ($11 million).</a></p> <p>Republican primary elections begin in Iowa in January, and Mr Trump’s fundraising efforts have gone into overdrive with daily emails to supporters asking for $US35 donations in return for a signed poster of his infamous mugshot in the Fulton County Jail in Georgia.</p> <p>His latest campaigning is directed at a looming autoworkers’ strike that could result in an expensive 10-day shutdown of the industry.</p> <p>Worker contracts with the carmakers Ford, GM and Stellantis all run out at 11.59pm this Thursday (Friday AEST), and United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain insists the union stands ready to go on strike on Friday at any company that has not reached a deal.</p> <p>Although not as influential as it was with peak membership of 1.5 million in 1979, the UAW’s workers and retirees still number more than 1 million, and about 25 per cent of them supported Mr Trump in the 2016 election.</p> <p>The former president claimed this week the Biden administration’s rush to move to electric vehicles – including a ban on combustion engines in government departments by 2027 – would squeeze traditional automakers and make it difficult for workers to get higher pay while sending jobs offshore.</p> <p>“The once fabled United Autoworkers of America will soon go out of business under crooked Joe Biden if he is allowed to pull off his all-electric car hoax. China will build them all,” he posted on Truth Social.</p> <p>“Joe Biden’s electric vehicle mandate will murder the US auto industry and kill countless union autoworker jobs forever, especially in Michigan and the Midwest.</p> <p>“The only acceptable policy for UAW members should be the complete and total repeal of Biden’s catastrophic EV mandate. President Trump looks forward to doing exactly that on his first day back in the Oval Office.”</p> <p>Mr Trump claims that he did more for autoworkers than any leader in history, noting the US withdrawal from the free trade pact known as the Trans Pacific Partnership, a renegotiation with Korea on tariffs for imported pick-up trucks, and replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.</p> <p>The Biden administration has not repealed any of these moves by Trump since coming to office. Before that, the Bush and Obama administrations loaned the auto industry, including GM and Chrysler, $US80 billion to avoid its collapse, saving 1.5 million jobs.</p> <p>“That’s why autoworkers will be voting for President Trump in massive numbers in 2024,” Mr Trump said.</p>',\n",

There’s the day Sydney Adamu (Ayo Edebiri) spends eating at restaurants across the city, the time Marcus (Lionel Boyce) spends in the pastry kitchen at a high-end restaurant in Copenhagen, and the pasta Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) makes for his love interest Claire (Molly Gordon), to name a few.</p> <p>But the food that I’ve seen talked about and even replicated the most on my social media feeds is an omelette Sydney makes for Natalie “Sugar” Berzatto (Abby Elliott) in the season’s penultimate episode, aptly titled “Omelette”.</p> <p>What makes this omelette so hunger-inducing is the line of Boursin cheese piped down the middle before it gets rolled up and then a sprinkling of crushed sour cream and onion potato chips – “The type with the ridges,” Sydney specifies.</p> <p>According to the show’s culinary producer, Courtney Storer, the Boursin omelette with potato chips was inspired by chef Ludo Lefebvre’s Boursin omelette (sans potato chips). The omelette on the show starts with Sydney whisking the eggs through a mesh strainer. While I am loath to dirty the extra dish, straining the eggs achieves an extremely smooth texture with no streaks of egg whites or bubbles. Made in the French style, the omelette is cooked so that the eggs don’t brown on the bottom and are baveuse, or still wet on top.</p> <p>The cheese melts into the eggs for an extremely creamy centre like I’ve never had before. Lefebvre recommends the cracked black pepper flavour of Boursin in the recipe he shared online, but in my re-creation, I opted for the garlic and herb version to mimic the flavours of the potato chips. (Or you could use whatever flavour of soft, spreadable cheese that you want to make the dish your own. The show does not specify which flavour of cheese is used.)</p> <p>Thanks to the cheese, the potato chips and a sprinkling of chives, the dish is full of onion-y, herb flavour with textural contrast between the creamy, supple omelette and the crisp chips.</p> <p>“I could cry,” Natalie said after taking her first bite.</p> <p>While the flavour of the omelette is delicious, what truly makes it special is the care it represents, which is what great hospitality is all about.</p> <p>At this point in the series, Natalie is well into her pregnancy while also serving as the manager of the soon-to-reopen restaurant. As the team gets ready for their friends and family debut, Natalie is looking the worse for wear and says she hasn’t eaten. After initially turning down Sydney’s offer to make her something, Natalie asks for an omelette. Sydney sees someone in clear need of nourishment and jumps at the chance to provide it.</p> <p>This scene speaks to part of what drew Sydney – and others both on the show and in real life – to food in the first place. Cooking and serving others can help foster a sense of connection and satisfaction.</p> <p>In a conversation with Carmy, Sydney calls the act of making an omelette for Natalie the best part of her day.</p> <p>“You like taking care of people,” he responds.</p> <p>“Yeah, I guess.”</p> <h2>‘The Bear’ Boursin omelette with potato chips</h2> <p>This French-style omelette based on the one shown in<em> The Bear</em> is filled with Boursin cheese and topped with crushed sour cream-and-onion chips. The eggs are whisked through a mesh strainer to get an extremely smooth texture with no trace of egg whites or bubbles, and the finished omelette is rubbed with butter to make it shine.</p> <p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p> <ul><li>3 large eggs</li><li>⅛ tsp fine salt</li><li>1 tbsp plus 1 tsp unsalted butter, divided</li><li>2 tbsp garlic-and-herb spreadable cheese, such as Boursin brand cheese</li><li>thinly sliced chives, for serving</li><li>crushed crinkle-cut sour cream and onion potato chips, for serving</li><li>freshly ground black pepper, for serving</li></ul> <p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>Set a mesh strainer inside a medium bowl. Crack the eggs into the strainer and whisk with a fork until they pass through the mesh. Set the strainer aside and whisk the salt into the eggs.</li><li>In a 25cm nonstick frypan over medium-low heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter, swirling to coat the bottom and sides of the pan.</li><li>Add the eggs and, using a rubber spatula in one hand, constantly stir the eggs while gently jerking the pan back and forth with your other hand. Cook the eggs, continuing to stir and scraping down the sides of the pan with the spatula periodically. Once the eggs are mostly set yet still runny and wet on top, about 3 minutes total, smooth them evenly across the skillet. Place dollops of cheese in a line across the upper third of the omelette.</li><li>Tilt the frypan and use the spatula to fold the top edge of the omelette over the cheese to the centre; use the spatula and gravity to nudge the omelette to roll and fold over completely. Slide it onto a plate, seam side down, and rub the top of the omelette with the remaining 1 teaspoon of butter. Top with a sprinkling of chives, crushed potato chips and a couple grinds of black pepper, and serve.</li></ol> <p><strong>Serves</strong> 1</p> <p><em>The Washington Post</em></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<ul><li>Good green salad with fried-onion vinaigrette</li></ul> <p>As lovely as the idea of eating food cooked from scratch &quot;a la minute&quot; for every meal sounds, it is entirely out of reach for all except the most privileged in terms of time and/or resources. But all is not lost for the rest of us.</p> <p>You might be familiar with meal planning, but a close relative is meal prepping, which involves crossing a few tasks off the week&apos;s cooking to-do list to make getting food on the table in the days that follow much simpler – and in many instances more flavourful.</p> <p>While you are certainly welcome to plan out what you want to eat for the coming week, there are general tasks you can do ahead of time that will set you up for success no matter what you ultimately choose to make.</p> <p>Perhaps you&apos;re the type of cook who starts every dish by sauteing a diced onion. Maybe you are planning to have a salad or grain bowl tossed with your favorite dressing for lunch every week.</p> <p>Or perchance you&apos;re of the know that whenever there are cooked beans at your disposal, dinner can be mere minutes away. If so, taking care of chopping a bunch of onions, mixing a batch of salad dressing or simmering a pot of legumes one afternoon will get you one step closer to your goal.</p> <p>Meal prep is all about increasing efficiency to make the most of your time in the kitchen. Here are 10 tasks you can complete to help feed your household with ease.</p> <h3>1. Make salad dressing</h3> <p>Salad dressings are a simple way to add pizzazz to not only greens and lettuces, but also grain bowls, cooked vegetables, proteins (such as grilled chicken breasts or steamed fish) and more. Sure, a basic vinaigrette requires only a handful of ingredients and a quick whisk (or my preferred method: a few shakes in a Mason jar), but why do it more times than you need to? Make one batch and pull it out of the fridge whenever you want to toss a salad or add an extra punch of flavour to your plate.</p> <h3>2. Roast vegies</h3> <p>Roasting is by far my favorite way to prepare vegetables. I love when they get nicely browned or even a bit charred in spots so much that I could eat – and have eaten – roasted vegies straight off a sheet pan as my meal. But beyond that, having them on hand to add to grain bowls or salads or to serve as a side accompanying a protein or carb can save you so much time and energy.</p> <h3>3. Cook a pot of grains or legumes</h3> <p>Grains and legumes are easy ways to add heft and substance to a meal – if not essentially be the meal itself. (I have no qualms with eating a bowl of beans for lunch or reheating rice to top with kimchi for dinner.) But cooked rice, beans, and other grains and legumes are useful ingredients in various recipes, such as fried rice or any dish where you might usually use canned beans.</p> <h3>4. Grate cheese</h3> <p>&quot;Bagged shredded cheese typically includes additives that prevent clumping. Unfortunately, they can also prevent melting,&quot; my colleague Becky Krystal wrote. &quot;If you want the best ooey, gooey texture for grilled cheese or mac and cheese, grate your own, using a box grater or your food processor.&quot; Then store it in the fridge, where it should last a few days.</p> <h3>5. Toast nuts</h3> <p>Toasted nuts are an easy way to add texture to any bowl or plate. Sure, you could buy already roasted nuts, but they are never quite as toasted as I&apos;d like them to be – and therefore not as nutty. Doing it yourself means that you can make your nuts as crispy, crunchy and flavourful as your heart desires. Plus, you can season the nuts with your favorite spices to add even more interest.</p> <h3>6. Make croutons or flavoured breadcrumbs</h3> <p>Speaking of texture, croutons and breadcrumbs are other examples where toasting them yourself might make you wish you always had the homemade versions around. You can add the croutons to salads, soups and stews, and use seasoned breadcrumbs to sprinkle atop vegies, pasta and whatever else you can think of.</p> <h3>7. Mix compound butters</h3> <p>Compound butter is just a fancy term for butter that has been flavoured with any number of ingredients. &quot;Classic additions, separately or together, are garlic, parsley and shallot,&quot; Krystal wrote in her primer on the subject. &quot;Citrus is a natural, too, whether it&apos;s zest, juice or even something like preserved lemon or lemon confit. The possibilities with dried spices are almost endless.&quot; When it comes to uses, the possibilities are endless, too. Compound butter works as an ingredient – use it to toast croutons, make garlic bread, whisk into pan sauces, etc – or a finishing touch – such as to melt over seared pork chops, roasted vegetables or your favourite pancakes.</p> <h3>8. Pickle vegies (or fruit!)</h3> <p>Keeping a jar – or five – of pickles in your fridge is always a good idea. While cucumbers are the default, the world of pickling is vast: You can pickle rhubarb, cauliflower, grapes, raisins, jalapeños, onions and so much more! Mix them in with salads and grain bowls; add them to sandwiches, burgers and tacos; use them as a topping for pizza; or eat them as a snack or when you&apos;re fending for dinner. The world is your oyster pickle.</p> <h3>9. Make bread dough</h3> <p>I get it, baking bread can be intimidating, but if you&apos;re looking for an easy entry point, focaccia is a great place to start. You can bake it as is to serve with soups and stews or make sandwiches, or use the dough as a base for pizza.</p> <h3>10. Chop herbs and vegies</h3> <p>Buying pre-chopped vegies from the grocery store is a great convenience – and they are particularly helpful for cooks with physical limitations – but they are often more expensive than if you sliced and diced them yourself. To save a few bucks, spend an afternoon readying produce that can then be stored in the fridge or freezer. For example, onions and garlic can be chopped or minced, stored in the freezer and then cooked straight from frozen. Chopped herbs will last in the refrigerator stored in a container with a damp towel for a couple of days, or you can mix them with olive oil and keep them in the freezer. With other fruits and vegies, you might need to take note of whether they oxidize, such as apples and potatoes, and save them for prepping in the moment (though cut potatoes can be stored submerged in water for up to 1 day). Another cool idea:<em> The Ultimate Meal Prep Cookbook</em> by America&apos;s Test Kitchen suggests spending time slicing or chopping pantry items, such as jarred artichoke hearts or olives, for additional convenience.</p> <p><em>The Washington Post</em></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Are we watching the dying days of Trump’s shambolic dynasty?',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>One of the most prosaic but nonetheless accurate explanations for the utter and seemingly inexplicable insanity that has surrounded Donald Trump, and in turn America, for some seven years now is this: That he is a man forever focused on tactics and virtually never on strategy.</p> <p>This is his pattern: Moved by the urges of a small child, he finds himself backed into a corner, and then embarks upon ever-more-outrageous plays to get himself out of it.</p> <p>This explains why we are at the mind-blowing pass we are at today: Donald Trump – to be clear, a former president of the United States, the world’s greatest democracy and most powerful nation – has been indicted for hush money payments to a porn star. And the betting involves how many more times he may be indicted in coming months. Pick your number, one to three. (My betting is on two, with three a distinct possibility.)</p> <p>If you recall, Trump, his bumbling fixer Michael Cohen, and the owner of an American supermarket tabloid, the <em>National Enquirer</em>, got together to pay Stormy Daniels, a porn star, $130,000 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump in the run-up to the 2016 election.</p> <p>This allegedly violated campaign finance laws in various ways. Cohen has already pleaded guilty and been imprisoned for this, and of course, he did whatever he did at Trump’s direction. Beyond this, Trump allegedly falsified business records to cover up the payments, a crime in itself.</p> <p>It seems odd that it took New York’s prosecutorial system this long, more than two years after Trump left office, to arrive at the decision to indict, just as the US justice system seems to have been taking its time on any prosecution of Trump related to the January 6 insurrection. It’s a cliche in the US: The wheels of justice grind slow. But they do indeed grind.</p> <p>Trump has lied variously about all of this, amid many denials of wrongdoing. In the last few weeks he has been delivering increasingly hysterical pronouncements as the indictment loomed. He called Manhattan District attorney Alvin Bragg, who is black, a racist. He posted a picture of Bragg, too – delivering increasingly hysterical pronouncements. Then Trump promised – in a message posted in the early hours of a Saturday morning, suggesting a sleepless night – “death and destruction” if he were to be arrested.</p> <p>He probably should be a bit unhinged. Right now, in the state of Georgia, which Trump lost in 2020, prosecutors have said indictments are imminent for the buffoonish attempts by Trump and his handlers to upend the state’s vote. At the same time, in Washington, a special prosecutor, Jack Smith, is looking into Trump’s well-documented theft and mishandling of national security documents – and, of course, the role the then-president played in the disgraceful and violent attacks on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p> <p>The potential indictment of a former president raises many questions. Will Trump actually be arrested? (Of course he will be, with Secret Service agents standing by.) Put in handcuffs? (Doubtful, though it would be nice to see.) Will there be a “perp walk”? (This term refers to a time-honoured NYPD practice of parading celebrity arrestees through a phalanx of tabloid photographers. Doubtful, though Trump has reportedly been a bit intrigued at the prospect.)</p> <p>Could he be denied bail and left to sit in a cell before trial? (That, too, would be interesting to watch, but it’s not going to happen. New York state law makes it difficult to deny the accused bail.)</p> <p>Of late, after a slow start, Trump has been out on the 2024 campaign trail, though that is a very high-toned phrase to use for his travelling sideshow of degenerates, who have, amazingly, been able to take the levels of vulgarity in his orbit to a new low.</p> <p>In Waco, Texas, the other day, wackadoodle ’70s rocker Ted Nugent opened the show, saying that he didn’t want his taxes to go to support the war in Ukraine: “I want my money back! I didn’t authorise any money to Ukraine to some homosexual weirdo,” he said. (In case you aren’t following Nugent’s train of thought, he was referring to Ukraine’s brave and defiant president, Waco, Texas, the other day.)</p> <p>All of these are problems Trump created for himself, partly, of course, out of his own degenerate tendencies, but also from his inability to plan or think clearly about the future. A few years ago, the comedian John Mulaney had a funny riff likening the Trump presidency to a horse being let loose in a hospital. (“It’s never happened before, and no one knows what the horse is going to do next, least of all the horse”.)</p> <p>Trump these days looks more like a man inside a pinball machine, bouncing around with differing velocities and in unexpectedly different directions by flippers and bumpers programmed by architects out of his control.</p> <p>His support inside the Republican Party remains solid; Donald Trump is now the patron saint of a particular strain of American who thinks that a man with a dismal string of recent electoral losses to his credit – and now with multiple and credible criminal indictments looming – should be their standard-bearer.</p> <p>To them, Trump’s tactical outrages are just part of the game in the reality TV show he is starring in inside his head, and theirs. I have a feeling the next season of it, starting soon, is going to be worth watching.</p> <p><b><i>Get a note directly from our foreign </i></b><b><i>correspondents </i></b><b><i>on what’s making headlines around the world. </i></b><b><i>Sign up for the weekly What in the World newsletter here</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

I was never called back and the sacking of Lattouf was not raised on the talkback program.<br/>It is clear to me that political censorship is very much alive and well on taxpayer-funded radio. The ABC appears to have a very jaundiced concept of “democracy” – a system I always thought to be reliant on fearless reporting and diversity of expression.<br/><strong>John Glazebrook, Terang</strong></p> <p><strong>ABC Big Brother response</strong><br/>Antoinette Lattouf has been sacked from the ABC for expressing her opinions on Instagram expressed as the Israeli “ongoing annihilation of Palestinians”. This did not occur during her capacity as a relief radio presenter and once again shows how “Big Brother” ABC is interfering with the personal lives of their employees.<br/>No wonder many are seeking employment elsewhere.<br/><strong>Alan Inchley, Frankston</strong></p> <p><strong>Trashing our core ethos</strong><br/>At Christmas, we celebrate the birth of the wonderful Jewish Palestinian Jesus who articulated the core ethos of humanity as kindness and truth. We are reminded of the biblical nativity narrative of how the Rome-backed, Jewish King Herod slew all the male children under two years old. Today, this biblical story is matched by the horrible reality of more than 8000 Palestinian children killed so far in Gaza, according to Hamas.<br/>The taxpayer-funded ABC has trashed kindness and truth by forbidding use of the terms “apartheid” and “genocide” in this context, and by sacking radio host Antoinette Lattouf for protesting against this ghastly present-day massacre of the innocents.<br/>Memo for Christmas gatherings: the world has two kinds of people, those opposing the mass murder of children, and the unforgivable others. Silence is complicity.<br/><strong>Gideon Polya, Macleod</strong></p> <p><strong>Surgical strikes work</strong><br/>A letter to the editor (<em>The Age</em>, 20/12), defending Israel’s actions in Gaza, posed the question of what would the 152 countries that voted for a humanitarian ceasefire have done if they had come under a terrorist attack. France similarly lost 130 people in November 2015 in the attack on Paris by a terrorist group based in Brussels, Belgium. It managed to run a successful operation that destroyed the terror cell without having to raze Brussels to the ground.<br/><strong>Carlo Carli, Brunswick</strong></p> <p><strong>Numbers don’t add up</strong><br/>Your correspondent asks what 152 nations would do if confronted by the deaths per capita Israel faced on October 7. An entirely valid question, but if we are talking about per capita: one in 125 Gazans have died since then. The horrors of Hamas on October 7 should in no way limit the horrors of death in Gaza. It must end.<br/><strong>Dechlan Brennan, Fitzroy North</strong></p> <p><strong>Netanyahu’s unknown exit plan</strong><br/>What are Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans? We understand his primary plan is to destroy Hamas by continually indiscriminately bombing Gaza, but what are his plans beyond that? Does he have an exit strategy and can nobody understand the seeds he is planting ensure the conflict will continue for many years to come?<br/>Like many Australians, I denounce the actions of Hamas on October 7, but these actions cannot be viewed in isolation. At the risk of sounding antisemitic, which I don’t believe I am, is Israel at risk of doing to people what was done to many of its own? Violence begets more violence.<br/><strong>David Conolly, Brighton</strong></p> <h3><strong>THE FORUM</strong></h3> <p><strong>Deputy tag ditched</strong><br/>The United States asked the Australian government to send naval vessels to protect shipping lanes in which, it is said, Houthi militants have been attacking ships bound for Israel or Israeli flagged ships. To the credit of the government, the request was refused. Sussan Ley labelled this a “weak” decision (“‘<a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/securing-our-home-key-amid-wars-and-rise-of-china-albanese-20231219-p5eshf.html\" target=\"_blank\">Securing our home’ key amid wars and rise of China: Albanese</a>”, 20/12).<br/>In reality, it was a strong decision made by an independent middle power signalling that Australia will no longer play “deputy sheriff” and come running when our rich and powerful ally whistles. It is to be hoped that this sign of Australia maturing as a nation continues.<br/><strong>Ken Rivett, Ferntree Gully</strong></p> <p><strong>Are we doing enough?</strong><br/>Anthony Albanese has made a mockery of the Australian-US relationship. The US asked for our support by having an Australian Navy vessel to demonstrate our strength, caring and commitment to protecting the world’s shipping in the Red Sea by keeping the Suez Canal open, despite rebel attacks.<br/>Albanese refused, stating: “We know that the USA understands the best way to support this is through diplomatic support, and our resources have been prioritised in our region in the Indo-Pacific. The main threat to shipping in the Indo-Pacific is from China.“<br/>What diplomatic support are we showing? Are we emailing the rebels with a request to stop?<br/>Is the Indo-Pacific in a situation that will stop the world’s most famous trade route? How much of our outgoing trade goods and incoming supplies may be affected if the Suez Canal is closed?<br/>We had worldwide chaos when the Ever Given ship blocked the Suez in March 2021. There were 369 ships queuing up to pass through the canal. An estimated $US6.9 billion worth of trade stopped. Twelve per cent of world trade traverses the Suez.<br/><strong>Ross Kroger, Barwon Heads</strong></p> <p><strong>Geographical link</strong><br/>Your correspondent (“Not present”, <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/this-footpath-joyriding-comes-at-a-cost-20231220-p5esoi.html\" target=\"_blank\">Letters</a>, 21/12) provides a long list of nations who have responded to the US call for naval support in the Red Sea. He bemoans the absence of Australia. Check the map, and you will find a common thread – all those countries are in the hemisphere where the events are occurring.<br/>For once, we have considered the geography before a knee-jerk reaction to the politics.<br/><strong>Tony Haydon, Springvale</strong></p> <p><strong>Trump held to account</strong><br/>Donald Trump’s reaction to the Colorado Supreme Court’s historic decision to disqualify him from standing for election next year is as predictable as it is full of hypocrisy (“After a legal bombshell, can Trump still run for office?” 21/12).<br/>Everything Trump accuses President Joe Biden of, he is blatantly guilty himself, especially claims of being a threat to democracy and trashing the Constitution.<br/>At last Trump is being held to account. Let there be more. Nick Toovey, Beaumaris<br/>He’s no victim<br/>Any suggestion that Donald Trump is a victim is nonsense. His multitude of problems are entirely self-inflicted. Should the Colorado ruling remain, the democratic ideals of the US and elsewhere will be enhanced.<br/>Trump’s recent anti-immigrant rant with vile and racist undertones should make him unelectable even if the legal processes against him don’t succeed.<br/><strong>Tony Delaney, Warrnambool</strong></p> <p><strong>Irrational appeal</strong><br/>Your correspondent asserts that the underlying rationality of the US voter will save the day for democracy in that country (“Concerns assuaged”, <a href=\"http://20231219-p5esfd.html\" target=\"_blank\">Letters</a>, 20/12), and ends with: “It is surely stretching credulity to think that US voters could abandon the cherished notion of patriotism, and countenance a known amoral criminal as their national leader.”<br/>Unfortunately, it is not. Indeed, many, especially those who feel left behind by liberal democracy, will enthusiastically welcome it.<br/>As Arthur Koestler wrote after escaping occupied Europe (Scum of the Earth, 1941): “Perhaps Hitler’s genius is not demagogy, not lying, but the fundamentally irrational approach to the masses, the appeal to the pre-logical, totemistic mentality.”<br/>Trump has learned the lesson well, and reason will provide no salvation for that blighted nation.<br/><strong>Barry Miskin, Essendon West</strong></p> <p><strong>Scooter eyesore</strong><br/>I counted six e-bikes and e-scooters near where I live today, none of which parked how they are supposed to be.<br/>They are a blight on the landscape – visual pollution. The businesses and councils that profit from these things need to take responsibility.<br/>Namely, these businesses should be required to carry comprehensive insurance that covers illegal use such as riding on footpaths, carrying passengers, speeding and for accidents, just like car insurance. Councils should provide designated parking areas, for which they can charge. Vehicles not parked in these areas should be heavily fined (a new income stream for councils).<br/><strong>Shaun Lawrence, Richmond</strong></p> <p><strong>Ceding control</strong><br/>An acquaintance is driving an unfamiliar vehicle at 100 km/h along a straight country road and notices a cyclist ahead. Slows down to 80 km/h, checks for other vehicles – nothing ahead or behind – and proceeds in sliding over to the oncoming lane, allowing the cyclist a wide berth. Failure to use the indicators results in the vehicle’s guidance system attempting to take control and direct the car straight for the cyclist. Not sure how the driver regained control over the vehicle, but this debacle raises all manner of safety and responsibility issues where so-called “guidance systems” are not fit for purpose and cannot be disabled.<br/><strong>Ronald Elliott, Sandringham</strong></p> <p><strong>Wrong priorities</strong><br/>After a dreadful year for road trauma, including a doubling of pedestrian and cyclist deaths, South Australia has announced a $168 million increase in road safety funding. Much will be for regional roads, but it also includes new infrastructure to improve safety for people walking and riding.<br/>Meanwhile, Victorians are still waiting. Our government can find tens of billions of dollars for one new road. But if you want a pedestrian crossing to safely cross a busy road, or a bike path to cycle safely to school or work, you probably have to wait decades. Our government funds only a handful each year. So every day, people are forced to take risks just to get around, sometimes with horrific consequences. Or they ditch trying to walk or cycle, and use a motor vehicle instead. The detriments are huge, not only to household budgets, but also to our health and environment.<br/><strong>Andrea Bunting, Brunswick</strong></p> <p><strong>Long term option</strong><br/>Paul Graham, lead author of the GenCost report (“<a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/renewables-cheaper-than-nuclear-coal-now-and-into-the-future-csiro-20231219-p5esga.html\" target=\"_blank\">Renewables cheaper than nuclear, coal now and into the future</a>”: CSIRO, 21/12), claims that the lengthy lead time for the construction of nuclear power facilities “does make it a difficult project for contributing significantly to our decarbonisation plans”.

The flags are slightly blurred, suggesting the focus is intended to be on Trump. The flags\\' red, white, and blue colors reinforce the political context of the image. The arrangement of the flags, with their folds and overlapping sections, adds depth and visual texture to the background.\\n\\n**Overall Composition:**\\n\\n* **Focus:** The image is clearly focused on Donald Trump, with the podium and flags serving as supporting elements. The blurred background draws attention to the central figure.\\n* **Lighting:** The lighting is bright and even, likely from artificial sources at the venue.

His animated expression and expansive hand gestures suggest a passionate delivery, aiming to connect with his audience on an emotional level. The prominent display of American flags creates a backdrop that reinforces the nationalistic themes prevalent in his political messaging.\\n\\nThe inclusion of the year 2024 on the podium sign immediately dates the image and places it within the context of the upcoming presidential election. This element makes the image particularly relevant for discussions surrounding Trump\\'s potential candidacy and the political landscape leading up to the election.\\n\\nThe image\\'s composition, with Trump as the central focus against a backdrop of flags, creates a visually compelling narrative. The slightly low angle adds a subtle sense of grandeur, while the blurred background ensures that the viewer\\'s attention remains fixed on Trump.\\n\\nThe text on the podium sign, \"TEXT TRUMP TO 88022,\" provides a direct call to action for the audience.

His posture is stiff, with his hands clasped in front of him, suggesting a formal and somewhat reserved demeanor. He appears to be looking directly ahead, possibly addressing the crowd.\\n\\n* **The Stage and Backdrop:** Trump stands on a black stage.

This backdrop reinforces the patriotic theme common at political rallies.\\n\\n* **The Crowd:** The crowd behind the barrier appears enthusiastic and engaged. Many are holding up smartphones, presumably taking photos or videos of the event.  Some are wearing hats or other items that suggest support for Trump. The crowd\\'s presence emphasizes the rally\\'s public nature and the attempt to generate support.\\n\\n* **The Videographer:** To Trump\\'s right, a videographer is actively filming the event. He holds a professional video camera with a stabilizer, indicating a focus on capturing high-quality footage.  The videographer\\'s presence underscores the importance of media coverage in political events and the desire to document and disseminate the message to a wider audience.\\n\\n**Image Context and Implications:**\\n\\nThis image likely depicts a campaign rally or similar political event. Such events are crucial for political figures to connect with their base, energize supporters, and convey their message directly to the public.  The image\\'s composition, with Trump as the central figure against the backdrop of the American flag and a supportive crowd, aims to project an image of strength, patriotism, and popular support.\\n\\n**Visual Analysis:**\\n\\n* **Focus and Depth of Field:** The focus is primarily on Trump, making him the clear subject. The crowd and the videographer are slightly out of focus, creating a sense of depth and placing emphasis on Trump\\'s presence.\\n\\n* **Lighting:** The lighting is even and bright, typical of outdoor daytime events. This clear lighting ensures that all details are visible and contributes to the image\\'s overall clarity.\\n\\n* **Color Palette:** The image\\'s color palette is dominated by the dark suit, red tie, and the red, white, and blue of the backdrop. These colors are symbolic of American patriotism and are often used in political imagery.\\n\\n* **Angle and Perspective:** The image is taken from a slightly low angle, which can subtly enhance the subject\\'s perceived height and authority.\\n\\n**Possible Uses of the Image:**\\n\\nThis image could be used in various contexts, including:\\n\\n* **News Coverage:** News outlets might use this image to accompany reports on the specific rally or on Trump\\'s political activities in general.\\n\\n* **Political Campaigns:** Trump\\'s campaign or supporting organizations could use the image in promotional materials to highlight his popularity and connection with his base.\\n\\n* **Social Media:** The image could be shared on social media platforms by supporters or opponents of Trump, generating discussion and debate.\\n\\n* **Historical Documentation:** The image serves as a visual record of a specific moment in Trump\\'s political career and could be used in historical analyses or documentaries.\\n\\n**Keywords for Image Retrieval:**\\n\\nDonald Trump, political rally, president, United States, campaign, supporters, crowd, American flag, patriotism, stage, videographer, media, politics, election, suit, tie, public speaking, event.\\n\\n\\n**Extended Description for Enhanced Retrieval:**\\n\\nThis photograph encapsulates the essence of a typical Donald Trump political rally, showcasing the former president in his element, engaging with his supporters.  The image\\'s composition is carefully constructed to convey a message of strength and popular appeal. Trump\\'s central position, his formal attire, and the patriotic backdrop all contribute to a carefully crafted image.\\n\\nThe crowd\\'s enthusiastic response, evident in their upraised smartphones and expressions, further reinforces the narrative of a strong connection between Trump and his base.  The presence of the videographer highlights the importance of media documentation in these events, serving both to record the moment and to broadcast the message to a wider audience.\\n\\nThe image\\'s color palette, dominated by the red, white, and blue of the American flag, underscores the patriotic theme that is often central to Trump\\'s political messaging.  This symbolism is further reinforced by Trump\\'s choice of a red tie, a color often associated with power and authority.\\n\\nThe image\\'s technical aspects, such as the focus on Trump and the slightly low angle, are also noteworthy. These choices contribute to a sense of Trump\\'s dominance and importance within the scene.\\n\\nThe photograph can be interpreted in various ways depending on the viewer\\'s perspective. Supporters might see it as a testament to Trump\\'s popularity and leadership, while critics might focus on the staged nature of the event or the specific messages being conveyed. Regardless of interpretation, the image serves as a powerful visual representation of a specific moment in American political history.  It captures the dynamics of a political rally, the relationship between a political figure and their supporters, and the role of media in shaping public perception.

       "   'description': 'This close-up, medium shot captures former U.S. President Donald Trump and professional golfer Bryson DeChambeau in a seemingly informal setting, possibly at a golf course.  The image is crisp, with the subjects in sharp focus against a slightly blurred background. The lighting is bright and even, suggesting a daytime, outdoor environment.\\n\\n**Donald Trump:**\\n\\nTrump, on the left side of the frame, is identifiable by his signature red \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap with the number \"45\" embroidered on the side, signifying his presidency as the 45th president of the United States. He is wearing a white, short-sleeved polo shirt emblazoned with the \"Trump New York\" logo, a crest with intricate detailing and the words \"Trump\" arched over the crest and \"New York\" written beneath.  His expression is somewhat serious, his mouth slightly open, perhaps mid-conversation. His fair skin is visible on his face and neck, showing some signs of age. His blond hair is visible beneath the edges of his cap.\\n\\nTrump\\'s presence dominates the left portion of the image.  His posture is relaxed, suggesting an informal atmosphere.  He is a well-known figure in American politics and business, having served as president from 2017 to 2021.  He is also a prominent real estate developer and media personality.  His political career has been marked by both significant support and strong opposition, and his presidency is considered one of the most controversial in American history.\\n\\n**Bryson DeChambeau:**\\n\\nDeChambeau, to the right of Trump, is seen in profile, his face turned slightly towards Trump.  He has dark, salt-and-pepper hair, styled in a slightly tousled manner.  He sports a full beard with a mix of dark and gray hairs. He is wearing a dark navy blue, short-sleeved polo shirt.  A brown leather watch with a metallic face is visible on his left wrist.  Small beige bandages are noticeable on the fingers of his left hand, possibly protecting small cuts or blisters, common among golfers.\\n\\nDeChambeau\\'s expression is thoughtful, his right hand touching his chin and mouth in a contemplative gesture.  His focus seems directed towards something outside the frame, possibly a point of interest on the golf course or someone speaking.  His muscular arms are visible, particularly his left forearm, where the bandages are applied.\\n\\nDeChambeau is a prominent figure in professional golf, known for his analytical approach to the game and his unconventional methods, including using single-length irons.  He has won several PGA Tour events, including the 2020 U.S. Open.  His distinctive physique and scientific approach to golf have made him a recognizable and often-discussed figure in the sport.\\n\\n**Background and Composition:**\\n\\nThe background of the image is out of focus, but appears to be a grassy area, consistent with a golf course setting.  Blurred figures wearing light-colored clothing can be seen in the background, suggesting other individuals present at the scene.  The out-of-focus background helps draw the viewer\\'s attention to Trump and DeChambeau.\\n\\nThe composition of the image places Trump and DeChambeau in the foreground, filling the frame.  The close proximity of the two figures suggests a conversation or shared moment of observation. The contrast between Trump\\'s white shirt and DeChambeau\\'s dark shirt further emphasizes their presence within the frame.\\n\\n**Possible Interpretations and Context:**\\n\\nThe image, given the attire and setting, most likely depicts Trump and DeChambeau at a golf event, perhaps at one of Trump\\'s golf courses.  The casual attire and relaxed posture suggest an informal, possibly friendly interaction.  The image could be interpreted as capturing a moment of discussion, perhaps about the game of golf, or potentially other topics.\\n\\nGiven Trump\\'s continued involvement in political discourse and DeChambeau\\'s status as a public figure, the image could be of interest to those following either individual.  The image could also be relevant to discussions about the intersection of sports, politics, and celebrity culture.\\n\\n**Image Details for Retrieval:**\\n\\n* **Subjects:** Donald Trump, Bryson DeChambeau\\n* **Location:** Likely a golf course\\n* **Clothing:** Trump in a white \"Trump New York\" polo shirt and red \"Make America Great Again\" hat; DeChambeau in a dark navy blue polo shirt.\\n* **Activity:** Possibly discussing golf or other topics.\\n* **Mood:** Informal, relaxed\\n* **Composition:** Close-up, medium shot, two figures dominating the frame.\\n* **Lighting:** Bright, even, daytime.\\n* **Background:** Blurred, grassy area with other figures visible.\\n* **Keywords:** Donald Trump, Bryson DeChambeau, golf, politics, sports, celebrity, MAGA, Trump New York, informal, discussion, golf course.\\n\\n\\nThis extended description provides a comprehensive analysis of the image, covering the individuals depicted, their attire, the setting, possible interpretations, and relevant keywords for image retrieval.  The detailed description aims to provide a thorough understanding of the image\\'s content and context, making it easily searchable and retrievable based on various criteria.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': 'The image captures former U.S. President Donald Trump addressing an audience from a podium at an event organized by the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC). \\n\\n**Donald Trump:**\\n\\nDonald Trump is a prominent American businessman, television personality, and politician who served as the 45th President of the United States from 2017 to 2021.  Before entering politics, he was a well-known real estate developer and owner of the Trump Organization, a conglomerate with interests in real estate, hospitality, entertainment, and various other industries. He also gained fame as the host of the reality television show \"The Apprentice.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s presidency was marked by significant policy changes, including tax cuts, deregulation, and appointments of conservative judges.  His administration pursued an \"America First\" foreign policy, withdrawing from international agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Agreement on climate change.  He also engaged in trade disputes with China and other countries.\\n\\nTrump\\'s presidency was also highly controversial, marked by numerous investigations and impeachments. He faced scrutiny for his business dealings, his rhetoric on immigration and race, and his relationship with Russia.  He was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, once for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and again for inciting an insurrection following the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Joe Biden.\\n\\n**The Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC):**\\n\\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition is a political organization that seeks to promote a strong relationship between the Republican Party and the American Jewish community. The RJC advocates for policies that align with conservative principles, including support for Israel, free markets, and a strong national defense.  The organization hosts events, conducts outreach, and engages in political advocacy to advance its agenda.\\n\\n**Image Details:**\\n\\n* **Setting:** The image appears to be taken indoors, in a large conference hall or ballroom. The backdrop is predominantly blue, with white columns flanking the stage area.\\n* **Trump\\'s Attire and Posture:** Trump is wearing a dark suit, white shirt, and blue tie. He has his right arm raised, with a clenched fist, a gesture often associated with strength and determination. He appears to be mid-speech, addressing the audience.\\n* **Podium and Signage:**  Trump stands behind a blue podium. The podium and the backdrop feature the RJC logo, a stylized eagle with outstretched wings, along with the organization\\'s website address (www.RJCHQ.org) and the hashtag #RJCSummit.  The backdrop also displays a stylized American flag design with red and white stripes and blue stars.\\n* **Audience:** The bottom of the image shows the heads and shoulders of some audience members. Some are seen raising their hands, suggesting applause or participation.\\n* **Lighting:** The stage area is brightly lit, focusing attention on Trump. The audience area is slightly darker.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe image conveys a sense of political rally or conference. Trump\\'s raised fist suggests a message of strength and resolve. The prominent RJC branding indicates the event\\'s focus on engaging the Republican Jewish community.  The overall composition and lighting emphasize Trump as the central figure, highlighting his role as the speaker and the main draw of the event.\\n\\n**Detailed Description of Visual Elements:**\\n\\n* **Color Palette:** The dominant colors are blue and white, reflecting the RJC\\'s branding and possibly the colors of the American flag.  Red is also present in the stylized flag design on the backdrop. The combination of blue, white, and red creates a patriotic and politically charged visual.\\n* **Composition:** The image is centered on Trump, with the podium and backdrop framing him. The audience is positioned in the lower part of the frame, creating a sense of perspective and scale.\\n* **Lighting:** The bright lighting on Trump and the stage area draws the viewer\\'s attention to the speaker and the message being conveyed. The darker audience area creates a contrast that further emphasizes Trump\\'s prominence.\\n* **Typography:** The text on the podium and backdrop is clear and legible, providing information about the event and the organization hosting it. The use of a hashtag (#RJCSummit) suggests an attempt to connect the event to a wider online audience.\\n* **Symbolism:** The eagle in the RJC logo symbolizes strength, freedom, and American patriotism.  The raised fist is a symbol of solidarity and resistance. The American flag design reinforces the event\\'s political context and its connection to American identity.\\n\\n**Interpretation and Context:**\\n\\nThe image can be interpreted as a representation of Trump\\'s ongoing engagement with the Republican Party base, particularly the Jewish constituency.

       "   'description': \"This image captures a moment at a formal event, likely a dinner or gala, featuring Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, and Ivana Trump, his first wife and a businesswoman known for her fashion and fragrance lines.\\n\\n**Donald Trump:**\\n\\nDonald Trump is prominently positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame. He is wearing a dark navy blue suit with a crisp white shirt and a bright blue tie with a subtle pattern, possibly small squares or dots. His expression is serious, almost stoic, with a slight hint of a closed-lip smile. His signature blond hair is combed back and styled in his characteristic manner. His gaze is directed slightly to his left, away from the camera. His hands are not visible in the frame, suggesting they might be resting on his lap or a table just out of view. The lighting on his face is even, highlighting his features and the texture of his suit.\\n\\n**Ivana Trump:**\\n\\nIvana Trump is seated to Donald Trump's right, also in the foreground. She is wearing a black jacket or coat with a textured pattern, possibly velvet or brocade. The jacket has a sheen that reflects the light, creating a sense of luxury. Underneath, she wears a dark, possibly glittery or sequined top.  A prominent silver chain necklace with large oval links adds to her glamorous appearance. She also wears large, dangling earrings that appear to be silver and possibly adorned with diamonds or other clear stones. Her blond hair is styled in a bouffant updo, a characteristic look for her. Her makeup is noticeable, with defined eyes and lips. Her expression is also serious, perhaps slightly pensive.

The backdrop features American flags and the facade of a brick building with white trim and large windows, suggesting a formal or official setting. The women\\'s attire and the flags create a striking contrast of colors and cultural symbols.

The uniformity of the color suggests a coordinated effort or shared affiliation.\\n* **Expressions and Poses:**  The women display a range of expressions, from broad smiles to more serious or contemplative looks. Some are looking directly at the camera, while others are engaged in conversation or looking off to the side.  Their poses vary; some stand with their arms at their sides, others have their arms crossed or are gesturing. One woman is extending her arm towards the camera, as if pointing or reaching out.  This variety of expressions and poses gives the image a dynamic and lively feel.\\n* **Accessories:** Some women are wearing jewelry, such as necklaces, bracelets, and watches.  A few are carrying small purses or handbags. One woman holds a cell phone, seemingly taking a picture or recording a video.

       "   'description': 'This is a political cartoon depicting former U.S. President Donald Trump and current U.S. President Joe Biden, satirizing the controversy surrounding classified documents found in both their possession after leaving office. The cartoon uses caricature, humor, and symbolism to critique the perceived hypocrisy of the situation.\\n\\n**Composition and Visual Elements:**\\n\\nThe cartoon is divided into two distinct sections, with Trump on the left and Biden on the right.  A large, ornate gold frame, reminiscent of a doorway or picture frame, separates them.  This frame bears the Presidential Seal of the United States and the acronym \"POTUS\" (President of the United States), symbolizing the office and its inherent power and responsibility.\\n\\n* **Donald Trump:** Trump is depicted shirtless, wearing a crown and a pink, fur-trimmed jacket.  His exaggerated physique, with a large belly and small hands, is a common caricature used in political cartoons. He is wrapped in numerous strips of paper labeled \"CLASSIFIED,\" \"ASSIFIED,\" and variations thereof. These strips are strewn around his feet and trail behind him, creating a visual representation of the classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort. He holds a red-and-white striped staff, possibly alluding to a circus ringmaster or a jester\\'s scepter, further emphasizing the cartoon\\'s mocking tone.  A speech bubble above Trump\\'s head reads, \"OOH!! THE HYPOCRISY… ANOTHER WORD I INVENTED. BTW,\" satirizing Trump\\'s frequent claims of being unfairly targeted and his tendency to coin or misuse words. A small heart-shaped patch on his jacket reads \"Moi,\" a French word for \"me,\" highlighting his perceived self-centeredness. A tattoo on his torso reads \"Me, the People,\" a distorted version of \"We, the People,\" the opening phrase of the U.S. Constitution, mocking Trump\\'s populist rhetoric.\\n\\n* **Joe Biden:** Biden is depicted in a dark suit and sunglasses, a more conventional representation of a president.  He appears to be tiptoeing away from a strip of paper labeled \"CLASSIFIED,\" also trailing from the POTUS frame.  Above Biden\\'s head are the words \"C\\'MON MAN,\" a common phrase he uses. This suggests a more cautious and perhaps embarrassed response to the discovery of classified documents in his possession.\\n\\n* **The POTUS Frame:** The frame acts as a central dividing point between the two figures, symbolizing the presidency and the shared responsibility for handling classified information. The documents trailing from the frame towards both Trump and Biden imply that both are implicated in the mishandling of classified materials.\\n\\n* **The Background:** The background is a washed blue, possibly representing the turbulent political climate surrounding the issue.  The loose, watercolor style adds to the cartoon\\'s informal and satirical tone.\\n\\n**Meaning and Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe cartoon\\'s central theme is hypocrisy, specifically regarding the handling of classified documents.  It highlights the seemingly contradictory positions of Trump and Biden, both of whom have faced scrutiny for possessing classified materials after leaving office.\\n\\n* **Trump\\'s Portrayal:** The cartoon portrays Trump as brazen and unapologetic about the classified documents found in his possession.  His crown and the scattered documents suggest a disregard for the rules and regulations surrounding classified information. The speech bubble further emphasizes this, with his claim of inventing the word \"hypocrisy\" coming across as ironic given the situation.\\n\\n* **Biden\\'s Portrayal:** Biden\\'s depiction is more subdued, suggesting a degree of embarrassment or an attempt to downplay the situation. His tiptoeing and the smaller number of documents associated with him imply a lesser degree of culpability, but the cartoon still implicates him in the mishandling of classified information.\\n\\n* **The Overall Message:** The cartoon\\'s juxtaposition of Trump and Biden emphasizes the perceived hypocrisy of both sides of the political spectrum. It suggests that while the specifics of each case may differ, both figures have ultimately failed to uphold the standards expected of those who have held the highest office in the land. The cartoon invites viewers to consider the broader implications of the issue and the potential double standards applied to political figures based on their affiliations.\\n\\n**Target Audience and Purpose:**\\n\\nThe cartoon is likely aimed at a politically aware audience familiar with the classified documents controversies surrounding both Trump and Biden. Its purpose is to satirize the situation and provoke reflection on the political climate and the handling of classified information. The cartoon\\'s humorous and exaggerated style makes it accessible to a wider audience, while its underlying message encourages critical thinking about political accountability.\\n\\n\\n**Keywords for Retrieval:**\\n\\n* Political cartoon\\n* Donald Trump\\n* Joe Biden\\n* Classified documents\\n* Hypocrisy\\n* Presidential Seal\\n* POTUS\\n* Satire\\n* Caricature\\n* Watercolor\\n* Political commentary\\n* Mar-a-Lago\\n* C\\'mon man\\n* Double standard\\n* Political accountability\\n\\n\\nThis extended description provides a detailed analysis of the cartoon\\'s visual elements, meaning, and intended audience, making it easier to retrieve the image based on relevant keywords and themes.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': 'This photograph captures a candid moment of two men, seemingly musicians David Byrne and Brian Eno, inside a Chemist Warehouse, a prominent Australian pharmacy chain. The image is rich in detail, showcasing not only the individuals but also the vibrant, bustling atmosphere of the store.\\n\\n**The Men:**\\n\\n* **David Byrne (left):**  Recognizable by his distinctive features and attire, Byrne stands slightly to the left of the frame. He is known as the former lead singer and guitarist of the influential new wave band Talking Heads. His musical career spans decades, marked by innovative work in various genres, including rock, funk, and world music.  He is also a visual artist, writer, and cyclist, known for his advocacy for urban cycling.  In the photograph, he wears a dark blazer over a dark, subtly patterned shirt and dark denim jeans. His expression is relaxed and approachable, almost as if he\\'s engaged in conversation.\\n\\n* **Brian Eno (right):**  Standing to the right, Eno, a renowned music producer, composer, and visual artist, complements Byrne\\'s presence.  Eno\\'s career is marked by pioneering work in ambient music and electronic music production. He has collaborated with numerous artists, including David Bowie, U2, and Coldplay, and is considered a highly influential figure in the music industry.  In the image, Eno wears a dark fedora, a dark blue plaid blazer, a black undershirt, and dark trousers.  He sports a full beard and a calm, almost contemplative expression.\\n\\n**The Setting: Chemist Warehouse**\\n\\nThe backdrop of the photograph is unmistakably a Chemist Warehouse. Several key visual elements confirm this:\\n\\n* **Bright Blue and Yellow Signage:** The dominant colors are the signature bright blue and yellow of the Chemist Warehouse branding. These colors are visible on the shelves, price tags, and promotional signs.\\n* **\"Cheaper @ Warehouse Prices\" Slogan:** This iconic slogan is clearly visible on yellow signs hanging from the ceiling, reinforcing the brand identity.\\n* **Product Placement and Pricing:** The shelves are stocked with a variety of health and beauty products, typical of a Chemist Warehouse.  Prominent brands like Colgate, Olay, and Nature\\'s Way are visible. The yellow price tags with black text are a characteristic feature of the store\\'s pricing strategy.\\n* **\"As Seen on TV\" Stickers:**  Many products feature circular stickers stating \"As Seen on TV,\" a common marketing tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.\\n* **\"Health Break\" Signage:**  The \"Health Break\" logo, a part of Chemist Warehouse\\'s branding for its health product sections, is visible on several shelves.\\n* **Metal Grid Shelving:** The metal grid shelving units are a standard fixture in Chemist Warehouse stores.\\n\\n**Composition and Details:**\\n\\nThe photograph is composed with the two men positioned centrally in the aisle, with shelves of products flanking them on both sides. This creates a sense of depth and draws the viewer\\'s eye towards the center. The aisle appears well-lit, likely due to fluorescent lighting typical of retail spaces.\\n\\nThe shelves are densely packed with products, creating a visually busy backdrop. The bright colors and varied packaging of the products contribute to the overall vibrancy of the scene.  The price tags, with their bold yellow and black design, stand out against the colorful products, emphasizing the store\\'s focus on value.\\n\\nThe \"3\" signs hanging from the ceiling, indicating further discounts, are a common promotional tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.  The \"Discount Chemist 50% Go\" sign suggests a sale or special offer on selected items.\\n\\nThe floor appears to be a light-colored tile, typical of retail environments.  A circular floor sticker, possibly indicating social distancing guidelines, is partially visible near Eno\\'s feet.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe photograph presents a striking juxtaposition of the two renowned musicians against the backdrop of a busy, everyday retail setting. The contrast between the artistic personas of Byrne and Eno and the commercial environment of Chemist Warehouse creates a sense of intrigue. The image captures a seemingly spontaneous moment, lending it a candid and unposed feel.  The vibrant colors, dense product displays, and prominent branding of Chemist Warehouse create a visually stimulating environment that further enhances the photograph\\'s impact. The presence of text throughout the image, from product names and prices to promotional slogans, adds another layer of detail and context. This photograph is not only a portrait of two influential musicians but also a snapshot of a particular time and place, capturing the essence of a ubiquitous Australian retail experience.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': \"This image captures a woman standing on a mezzanine level within a modern architectural space, dominated by reflective surfaces and geometric forms. The perspective is from below, looking up towards the woman and the complex interplay of reflections created by the surrounding structure.\\n\\n**The Woman:**\\n\\nThe woman is positioned near the center of the frame, leaning against a railing on the mezzanine. She has shoulder-length light brown hair and is wearing glasses and what appears to be a dark-colored long-sleeved top. Her posture is relaxed, and she seems to be looking upwards and slightly to the right, possibly contemplating the architectural features around her.  She isn't immediately recognizable as a public figure.\\n\\n**The Architectural Space:**\\n\\nThe space is characterized by a striking combination of reflective surfaces, likely polished metal or mirrored panels, and warm-toned wooden elements. The reflective surfaces create a kaleidoscopic effect, multiplying the woman's image and distorting the lines of the structure. This creates a sense of disorientation and complexity, challenging the viewer's perception of depth and space.\\n\\n* **Reflective Panels:** These are the dominant feature of the image, forming a series of angled planes that converge and diverge, creating a dynamic and fragmented visual experience.  The panels appear to be seamlessly joined, enhancing the sense of fluidity and continuous reflection. The reflections not only multiply the image of the woman but also capture the light sources within the space, adding streaks and patches of brightness to the overall composition.\\n\\n* **Wooden Elements:** In contrast to the cool, reflective surfaces, warm-toned wooden elements are visible, likely forming part of the mezzanine floor and possibly some structural supports. These wooden elements ground the image, providing a visual anchor amidst the reflective chaos. The contrast in textures and colors adds depth and complexity to the overall aesthetic.\\n\\n* **Mezzanine:** The mezzanine level, where the woman is standing, appears to be a simple, rectangular platform with a wooden railing. It projects out into the space, surrounded by the reflective panels, creating the impression of floating within the reflective environment.\\n\\n* **Lighting:** The lighting within the space is not directly visible, but its effects are evident in the reflections on the panels.  The light appears to be diffuse and even, possibly emanating from concealed sources within the ceiling or walls. This soft lighting enhances the reflective qualities of the surfaces and contributes to the overall ethereal atmosphere.\\n\\n* **Geometric Forms:** The architecture is defined by strong geometric forms, primarily triangles and rectangles, created by the intersecting planes of the reflective panels. These sharp angles and clean lines contrast with the organic curves of the woman's figure, adding another layer of visual interest.\\n\\n**Composition and Perspective:**\\n\\nThe image is composed with a strong sense of symmetry and perspective. The low vantage point, looking upwards towards the mezzanine, emphasizes the height and complexity of the space. The converging lines of the reflective panels draw the viewer's eye towards the woman at the center, while the reflections create a sense of infinite regress, extending the space beyond the boundaries of the frame.\\n\\n**Possible Interpretations:**\\n\\nThe image invites multiple interpretations. The interplay of reflections and geometric forms could be seen as a metaphor for the multifaceted nature of human perception or the complexities of modern life. The woman's contemplative pose suggests a sense of wonder or introspection, perhaps reflecting on the surrounding environment or her place within it. The contrast between the warm, organic wood and the cool, reflective metal could represent the balance between nature and technology, or between the human and the artificial.\\n\\n**Keywords for Image Retrieval:**\\n\\n* Architecture\\n* Modern architecture\\n* Reflective surfaces\\n* Mirrors\\n* Geometric forms\\n* Mezzanine\\n* Woman\\n* Contemplation\\n* Interior design\\n* Kaleidoscope\\n* Disorientation\\n* Perspective\\n* Symmetry\\n* Light and shadow\\n* Metal\\n* Wood\\n\\n\\n**Detailed Description for Retrieval Enhancement:**\\n\\nThe image showcases a woman within a visually captivating architectural space. The space is defined by its intricate network of reflective panels, likely made of polished metal or mirrored material. These panels create a kaleidoscopic effect, multiplying the woman's image and distorting the lines of the structure. The reflections capture the ambient light, adding streaks and patches of brightness to the composition.\\n\\nThe woman, positioned on a mezzanine level, stands as a focal point amidst the reflective surfaces. Her contemplative pose and upward gaze suggest a sense of wonder or introspection. The warm-toned wooden elements of the mezzanine and surrounding structure provide a visual anchor, contrasting with the cool, reflective surfaces.\\n\\nThe architectural design emphasizes geometric forms, primarily triangles and rectangles, formed by the intersecting planes of the reflective panels. This geometric precision contrasts with the organic curves of the woman's figure. The low vantage point from which the image is taken accentuates the height and complexity of the space. The converging lines of the reflective panels draw the viewer's eye towards the woman at the center, while the reflections create a sense of infinite regress.\\n\\nThe image can be interpreted in various ways, possibly symbolizing the complexities of human perception or the interplay between nature and technology. The woman's presence within this dynamic environment adds a human element to the abstract architectural forms.\\n\\n\\nThis detailed description aims to provide a comprehensive representation of the image's content and potential interpretations, facilitating effective retrieval based on various search queries related to architecture, reflection, geometry, and human presence within built environments.\\n\",\n",

       "   'description': 'The image captures Aryna Sabalenka, a Belarusian professional tennis player, holding the championship trophy of the Adelaide International women\\'s singles title. She is kissing the trophy, her eyes closed in a moment of triumph and joy.\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed breakdown of the image:\\n\\n**Subject:** Aryna Sabalenka, recognizable by her distinctive features and athletic build, is the central figure. She is holding the trophy aloft, both hands carefully supporting its base. Her head is tilted back slightly, and her lips are puckered as she kisses the trophy. Her eyes are closed, suggesting a moment of intense emotion and satisfaction.\\n\\n**Trophy:** The trophy has a unique design. The top portion appears to be a stylized, elongated, and slightly curved form, possibly made of wood or a similar material with a dark, reddish-brown finish.  Etched or painted onto this top piece is a pattern of concentric, wavy lines reminiscent of traditional Aboriginal Australian art. This sits on a rectangular base, which is dark-colored, possibly black.  On the front face of the base is a plaque with the words \"WOMEN\\'S SINGLES CHAMPION\" stacked vertically above the logo for the Adelaide International tournament. The logo consists of a stylized \"A\" and the words \"ADELAIDE INTERNATIONAL\" beneath it.\\n\\n**Sabalenka\\'s Attire:** She is wearing a black, sleeveless tennis dress with a simple, round neckline. The Nike logo, a white swoosh, is visible on the upper left chest area. A black sports watch is on her left wrist, and a delicate gold necklace with a small pendant is visible around her neck. Her hair is pulled back into a messy bun, some strands escaping to frame her face.  A small tattoo is visible on the inside of her left forearm.\\n\\n**Background:** The background is out of focus, but it is clearly a tennis stadium. The blurred shapes of spectators, seated in rows, are visible. The color scheme of the background is predominantly dark, with hints of color from the spectators\\' clothing.  A section of the stadium wall or barrier is visible behind Sabalenka, and it appears to be black.  Part of a sponsor\\'s sign is visible in the bottom left corner, reading \"MARRIOTT BONVOY\" in white letters against a black background.  A partially visible logo featuring a stylized outline of a house is in the lower right corner.\\n\\n**Lighting and Composition:** The lighting is bright and focused on Sabalenka, making her stand out against the blurred background. The composition is centered on her and the trophy, drawing the viewer\\'s attention to her expression of victory.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:** The image conveys a strong sense of achievement and joy. Sabalenka\\'s closed eyes and the kiss she bestows on the trophy express her emotional connection to the victory. The unique design of the trophy, incorporating elements of Aboriginal art, adds a distinct local flavor.  The blurred stadium background reinforces the context of the image as a moment of triumph in a professional sporting event.\\n\\n**Keywords for Image Retrieval:** Aryna Sabalenka, tennis, Adelaide International, champion, trophy, victory, celebration, sports, athlete, Belarusian, women\\'s singles, Nike, stadium, tournament, Aboriginal art, winning.\\n\\n**Extended Description for Enhanced Retrieval:**\\n\\nThe image encapsulates the culmination of athletic prowess and dedication, capturing the raw emotion of victory. Aryna Sabalenka, a rising star in the world of professional tennis, is seen savoring her hard-earned triumph at the Adelaide International.  The image freezes a fleeting yet powerful moment, her kiss on the trophy symbolizing the realization of a significant achievement.\\n\\nThe trophy itself is more than just a piece of metal; it represents the culmination of hours of training, strategic planning, and intense competition. Its unique design, incorporating elements of indigenous Australian art, adds a layer of cultural significance, connecting the sporting event to the local context.  The concentric, wave-like patterns on the trophy evoke a sense of movement and dynamism, mirroring the athleticism and grace displayed on the tennis court.\\n\\nSabalenka\\'s attire, a practical yet stylish black tennis dress, reflects the demands of her sport. The Nike logo subtly underscores the commercial aspect of professional sports, while her black sports watch hints at the precision and timing crucial to success in tennis.  The small tattoo on her arm adds a personal touch, reminding us that beneath the veneer of professional athlete lies an individual with their own unique story.\\n\\nThe out-of-focus background, a tapestry of blurred faces and stadium structures, provides context without distracting from the central subject.  It serves as a reminder that this moment of personal triumph unfolds within the larger arena of professional sport, witnessed by a crowd of spectators.  The partially visible sponsor logos, such as \"MARRIOTT BONVOY,\" subtly hint at the economic ecosystem surrounding professional tennis.\\n\\nThe image\\'s composition, centered on Sabalenka and the trophy, emphasizes the significance of the moment. The bright lighting illuminates her face, highlighting her expression of pure joy and satisfaction. The contrast between the sharp focus on Sabalenka and the blurred background further isolates and emphasizes her emotional response.\\n\\nThis image is not just a record of a sporting victory; it\\'s a glimpse into the emotional landscape of an athlete at the peak of their performance. It captures the passion, dedication, and sheer joy that drive individuals to excel in their chosen field.  It\\'s a celebration of athleticism, perseverance, and the sweet taste of victory.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': 'This photograph captures a scene within the Newark Liberty International Airport, specifically in front of a departure/arrival information display. Two individuals are the focal point, their attention directed towards the electronic board displaying flight details. The overall ambiance suggests a typical airport setting, with the primary focus on the information display and the people interacting with it.\\n\\n**Detailed Description:**\\n\\nThe image is dominated by a large, multi-panelled electronic display screen showcasing flight information. This screen is divided into three sections, each dedicated to a specific category: \"Terminal A Departures,\" \"Terminal B Departures,\" and \"Terminal B Arrivals.\" Each section lists the departing or arriving city, airline, flight number, gate, scheduled time, and status. The majority of flights listed seem to be experiencing delays, as indicated by the \"Delayed\" status followed by a revised time. The screen\\'s color scheme is primarily blue and green, with white and yellow text for easy readability. The words \"Welcome to Newark Liberty International Airport\" are displayed prominently below the central \"Terminal B Departures\" section. The date and time, \"January 11 7:56 AM,\" are visible in the bottom right corner of the \"Terminal B Arrivals\" section.\\n\\nTwo individuals stand before this information board, their gazes fixed upon the displayed flight details. The person on the left is dressed in dark-colored attire, consisting of a black jacket and dark blue jeans. They wear dark shoes and carry a light pinkish-brown knitted or crocheted bag. Their hair appears to be dark and short, possibly shoulder-length. They are raising both hands towards the screen, seemingly pointing or gesturing at specific flight information. A face mask is visible, suggesting adherence to health and safety guidelines.\\n\\nThe individual on the right is also dressed in dark clothing, wearing a dark blue jacket with a lighter blue stripe across the chest and black trousers. They wear dark shoes and carry a dark shoulder bag. Their hair appears to be dark and short. This person stands with their hands at their sides, their posture suggesting attentiveness to the information displayed.\\n\\nThe background wall behind the information board and the individuals is plain and light-colored, likely off-white or light gray. This neutral backdrop emphasizes the electronic display and the people in the foreground. To the left of the information board, a wall-mounted hand sanitizer dispenser is visible, accompanied by a poster encouraging hand hygiene. The poster displays the message \"Lend a hand to stop the spread... Better yet, lend both hands\" along with an image of hands and a hand sanitizer bottle.\\n\\nThe floor is a speckled pattern, possibly terrazzo or a similar material, reflecting the light from the overhead fixtures and the electronic display. A metal baseboard or trim runs along the bottom of the wall, adding a subtle visual element to the scene.\\n\\n**Image Context and Analysis:**\\n\\nThe image likely depicts a common scene at an airport: travelers checking flight information. The prevalence of \"Delayed\" statuses on the screen suggests potential travel disruptions, possibly due to weather or other unforeseen circumstances.

       "   'description': 'The image presents a medium shot of four men, seemingly reacting with a mixture of shock, amusement, and perhaps a hint of irony, to the contents of a newspaper they are holding. The setting appears to be a dimly lit bar or restaurant, with a visible bar area and shelving stocked with bottles in the background. The overall mood is lighthearted and possibly satirical, suggesting a comedic context.\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed breakdown of the image:\\n\\n**The Men:**\\n\\n* **Man 1 (Left):** This man has light skin, reddish-blond hair, and a short, full beard. He wears a gray textured blazer over a light purple patterned dress shirt. A silver watch with a dark band is visible on his left wrist. He holds the left side of the newspaper, his expression one of exaggerated shock or surprise. His eyes are wide, and his right hand is partially covering his mouth, as if stifling a gasp.  He appears to be in his 30s or 40s.\\n\\n* **Man 2 (Center Left):** This man has light skin, dark hair, and wears dark-rimmed glasses. He is dressed in a dark, possibly black, long-sleeved shirt. His face is close to Man 1, and his expression mirrors the surprise, though perhaps slightly less exaggerated. His mouth is open, and his eyes are wide. He appears to be in his 30s or 40s.\\n\\n* **Man 3 (Center Right):** This man has light skin, light brown hair styled in a somewhat tousled manner. He wears a dark jacket over a red and black plaid shirt. He is positioned slightly behind the other two, peeking over their shoulders at the newspaper. His expression is one of amusement or mild surprise, with a hint of a smirk. He appears to be in his 30s or 40s.\\n\\n* **Man 4 (Right):** This man has light skin, a shaved head, and a short beard. He wears a dark, possibly corduroy, jacket over a maroon t-shirt. He holds the right side of the newspaper and appears to be reading it with a mixture of amusement and perhaps skepticism. His expression is less exaggerated than the others, but he seems to be in on the joke. He appears to be in his 30s or 40s.\\n\\n**The Newspaper:**\\n\\nThe newspaper is the central prop and focus of the image. It is designed to mimic a tabloid, with large, bold headlines and a graphic-heavy layout.  The visible text provides clues to the humorous nature of the image:\\n\\n* **\"The Chaser\":** This title is prominently displayed across the top right section of the newspaper. \"The Chaser\" is an Australian satirical news publication known for its pranks and humorous social commentary. This immediately establishes a comedic context for the image.\\n\\n* **\"Sport\":** This word is printed in large, block letters on the left side of the newspaper, mimicking the style of sports headlines.  However, the subheading reveals the satirical nature: \"Beckham considers lucrative new hairdresser.\" This juxtaposes the serious tone of sports news with an absurd and humorous story.\\n\\n* **\"Harry Potter Exclusive! Sirius\":** This headline, located below \"The Chaser\" title, parodies entertainment news. The use of \"Sirius\" likely refers to Sirius Black, a character from the Harry Potter series, but the context suggests a humorous or misleading story.\\n\\n* **Other Text:**  Smaller text snippets are visible on the newspaper, but they are difficult to fully decipher. They likely contribute to the overall satirical tone.\\n\\n**The Background:**\\n\\nThe background is somewhat blurred but provides context. It appears to be the interior of a bar or restaurant.  Visible elements include:\\n\\n* **Bar Area:** A section of a bar counter is visible on the left side, with shelves containing bottles of alcohol. The lighting in this area is warm and inviting.\\n\\n* **Lighting Fixtures:** Several hanging pendant lights are visible, contributing to the ambiance of the setting. Some appear to be industrial-style metal shades, while others are more decorative.\\n\\n* **Dark Walls and Windows:** The walls and windows in the background are predominantly dark, creating a contrast with the warmer lighting around the bar area.\\n\\n\\n**Overall Impression and Possible Interpretations:**\\n\\nThe image likely promotes \"The Chaser\" publication or a related project, using humor and satire to capture attention. The men\\'s exaggerated reactions suggest they are either reading a particularly outrageous story or are involved in a staged comedic scene. The tabloid-style newspaper with its absurd headlines reinforces the comedic and satirical nature of the image.  The setting of a bar or restaurant adds to the casual and social atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n**Keywords for Image Retrieval:**\\n\\n* The Chaser\\n* Satire\\n* Humor\\n* Newspaper\\n* Tabloid\\n* Comedy\\n* Bar\\n* Restaurant\\n* Men\\n* Reading\\n* Shocked\\n* Amused\\n* Exaggerated expressions\\n* Harry Potter\\n* David Beckham\\n* Australian media\\n* Parody\\n* Social commentary\\n* Prank\\n\\n\\nThis detailed description, along with the provided keywords, should optimize the image for retrieval in various search contexts.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': \"This image captures a vibrant street scene, likely in a pedestrianized alley or laneway, bustling with people and hinting at a blend of urban life, leisure, and perhaps a touch of tourism. The focus is on two young women in the foreground, but the image encompasses a broader context of the surrounding environment and other individuals.\\n\\n**Technical aspects and composition:**\\n\\n* **Depth of field:** The photograph employs a shallow depth of field, sharply focusing on the two women while progressively blurring the background. This technique isolates the subjects, drawing the viewer's attention to them, while still providing a sense of the bustling atmosphere.\\n* **Perspective:** The image is taken from a slightly elevated perspective, possibly from a standing position, offering a clear view of the street and the people within it.\\n* **Lighting:** The lighting appears to be natural, possibly late afternoon or early evening, judging by the warm hues and the way the light falls on the buildings. There's a mix of ambient light and possibly some artificial light sources from shopfronts or streetlights, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow.\\n* **Color palette:** The image features a warm, inviting color palette with earthy tones dominating. The women's clothing, the brown jacket and denim overalls, contributes to this, as does the orange of the high-visibility jacket worn by a man in the foreground. These warm colors are contrasted by cooler tones in the background, such as the grays of the buildings and the darker clothing of some pedestrians.\\n* **Composition:** The two women are positioned slightly off-center, creating a balanced composition that adheres to the rule of thirds. The lines of the street and the buildings create a sense of depth and perspective, leading the viewer's eye into the scene.\\n\\n**Subjects and details:**\\n\\n* **The two women:** The two young women in the foreground are the primary subjects. They appear to be friends or acquaintances, engaged in conversation and walking together. The woman on the left wears denim overalls over a dark top and a dark scarf. Her curly hair frames her face, and she has a cheerful expression. The woman on the right wears a brown puffer jacket and dark pants. Her hair is dark and straight, and she also appears to be smiling. Their body language suggests a relaxed and comfortable interaction.\\n* **The man in the high-visibility jacket:** A man wearing an orange high-visibility jacket is prominently positioned in the blurred foreground. He appears to be talking on a mobile phone or perhaps vaping, his hand raised to his mouth. The bright orange of his jacket contrasts strongly with the other colors in the scene, making him a visually striking element even though he's out of focus. This suggests he might be a worker in the area, possibly involved in construction or maintenance.\\n* **Other pedestrians:** The background is populated with other pedestrians, some walking individually, others in groups. They are blurred, but their presence contributes to the overall impression of a busy and active street scene. Their clothing styles and movements add to the sense of everyday urban life.\\n* **The street and buildings:** The street itself appears to be a narrow lane or alleyway, lined with buildings on both sides. The buildings are a mix of architectural styles, suggesting a historical or perhaps revitalized urban area. Some of the buildings have signage, hinting at shops, restaurants, or other businesses. The blurred signs add to the sense of place and context, although the specific names and details are not legible.\\n* **Street furniture and details:**  There are glimpses of street furniture, such as a green bollard in the mid-ground, which adds to the urban setting. There are also awnings or umbrellas extending from some of the buildings, likely providing shade for outdoor seating areas. These details contribute to the impression of a pedestrian-friendly environment, possibly designed for shopping, dining, or socializing.\\n* **Blurred lights and signs:** The background features blurred lights and signs, which add to the sense of vibrancy and activity. These lights likely emanate from shopfronts, restaurants, or streetlights, creating a warm and inviting ambiance. The blurred nature of these elements enhances the depth of field and contributes to the overall aesthetic of the image.\\n\\n**Possible interpretations and context:**\\n\\n* **Urban life:** The image offers a snapshot of urban life, capturing the energy and diversity of a pedestrianized street. The mix of people, businesses, and architectural styles suggests a thriving urban environment.\\n* **Leisure and socializing:** The presence of outdoor seating areas and the relaxed demeanor of the two women in the foreground suggest a focus on leisure and socializing. The street might be a popular spot for meeting friends, shopping, or enjoying a meal.\\n* **Tourism:** The bustling atmosphere and the variety of businesses might indicate a tourist destination or a popular area for both locals and visitors. The image could be used to promote the area as a vibrant and attractive place to visit.\\n* **Everyday moments:** The image captures an everyday moment, a fleeting interaction between two friends in a busy urban setting. This sense of spontaneity and authenticity adds to the image's appeal.\\n\\n\\n**Keywords for image retrieval:**\\n\\nStreet scene, urban life, pedestrians, city, alleyway, laneway, friends, walking, talking, socializing, shopping, restaurants, architecture, buildings, signs, lights, blurred background, shallow depth of field, warm colors, evening, casual, candid, authentic, street photography, pedestrian zone, outdoor seating, high-visibility jacket, worker, bollard, awning, umbrella, tourism, leisure, everyday moments, rule of thirds.\\n\",\n",

Her career has been marked by advocacy for Indigenous Australians and social justice issues.  She is a member of the Australian Labor Party.\\n\\n\\n**Image Description:**\\n\\n\\n**Composition and Focus:**\\n\\nThe photograph is a medium shot, framing Linda Burney from approximately the waist up. She is positioned slightly off-center, drawing the viewer's attention directly to her. The depth of field is relatively shallow, keeping Burney in sharp focus while the background figures are slightly blurred. This technique further emphasizes her as the primary subject.\\n\\n\\n**Linda Burney's Appearance and Actions:**\\n\\nBurney is a woman with dark hair pulled back into a ponytail. She wears dark-rimmed glasses with a purplish hue and a light pink jacket with a subtle floral pattern. A pearl necklace adds a touch of elegance to her attire. She is actively engaged with a document on the table before her, holding a pen in her right hand and appearing to either write or underline something. Her left hand rests on the document, her fingers lightly spread. A smartwatch is visible on her left wrist. Her expression suggests focus and engagement with the task at hand. Her mouth is slightly open, as if she is speaking or about to speak.\\n\\n\\n**Setting and Background:**\\n\\nThe setting is clearly a parliamentary chamber. The background features green leather seating, characteristic of such legislative spaces. Two individuals are partially visible behind Burney, one directly behind her and another to her right.

The person directly behind her is wearing a dark blue suit and a white shirt, and he has his hands raised, perhaps gesturing while speaking. The person to her right is wearing a light gray or white suit jacket and a dark-colored garment underneath. A portion of a third person, dressed in a dark suit and a bright yellow tie, is visible in the bottom left corner of the frame. The background also includes what appears to be stacked papers or documents on a surface behind Burney, hinting at the administrative nature of the environment.\\n\\n\\n**Table and Documents:**\\n\\nThe table in front of Burney is dark, possibly wood, and appears to be an antique or ornate piece of furniture, with metallic embellishments visible along the edges. The document she is working with is open and lies flat on the table. It appears to be a standard white paper document.  Several colored tabs are attached to the side of the document, suggesting organization and indexing. A black folder or portfolio lies underneath the document. Two microphones are positioned on the table, directly in front of Burney, indicating that her words are being recorded and amplified.\\n\\n\\n**Lighting and Color Palette:**\\n\\nThe lighting in the image is even and balanced, likely from artificial sources within the chamber. The overall color palette is subdued, with the dominant colors being the greens of the seating, the dark tones of the suits worn by the background figures, and the softer pink of Burney's jacket. The colored tabs on the document provide small but noticeable splashes of brighter color.\\n\\n\\n**Possible Interpretations and Context:**\\n\\nThe image suggests a moment of activity and engagement within a formal political setting. Burney's focused expression and interaction with the document imply that she is actively participating in the parliamentary proceedings, perhaps reviewing legislation, taking notes, or preparing to address the chamber. The microphones reinforce the importance of her actions and words within this context. The presence of other individuals in suits in the background further emphasizes the formal and official nature of the event.

       "   'description': 'This image captures a dramatic scene centered around a vintage light blue car against a stark black backdrop. The composition and lighting create a sense of mystery and tension, reminiscent of a theatrical production or film still.\\n\\n**Technical aspects and composition:**\\n\\n* **Lighting:** The lighting is highly focused and dramatic, illuminating the car\\'s interior and the individuals within, while the background remains completely dark. This chiaroscuro effect draws the viewer\\'s attention to the subjects and enhances the theatrical quality of the image.  The light source appears to originate from within the car, perhaps the headlights, casting a warm, yellowish glow on the faces of the occupants. This creates a strong contrast with the cool blue of the car\\'s exterior and the surrounding darkness.\\n* **Focus:** The image is sharply focused on both the individuals inside the car and the young woman leaning against it. The clarity of the image allows for detailed observation of their expressions and attire.\\n* **Angle:** The camera angle is slightly low, looking up towards the subjects. This perspective gives the car and its occupants a sense of prominence and slightly elevates the young woman standing outside.\\n* **Framing:** The black background acts as a natural frame, isolating the car and the people from any other distractions. This tight framing intensifies the focus on the scene and contributes to the overall dramatic effect.\\n* **Composition:** The composition is balanced, with the car occupying the central space and the young woman positioned to the right, creating a visual anchor. The arrangement of the figures inside the car adds to the depth and complexity of the scene.\\n\\n**Subjects:**\\n\\n* **The Car:** The vehicle is a vintage model, possibly from the 1950s or early 1960s, judging by its design. Its light blue color stands out against the black background, making it a focal point. The car\\'s condition appears to be somewhat worn, suggesting a history and adding to the narrative potential of the image.  The open passenger-side door further adds to the dynamism of the scene, hinting at movement or anticipation. A small, rectangular sticker is visible on the windshield, likely a registration or inspection sticker. It bears the number \"9\" and the word \"PRIVATE,\" offering clues about the car\\'s history or usage.\\n* **The Young Woman:** Standing outside the car, a young woman leans against the open door. She has light skin, light brown hair styled in two braids, and is looking directly at the camera with a neutral, almost pensive expression. Her attire consists of a light-colored turtleneck sweater, a colorful, knitted vest with horizontal stripes of varying colors, and what appears to be brown pants or a skirt. Her posture is relaxed yet attentive, suggesting a connection to the occupants of the car.\\n* **The Driver:** A man with short, light brown or graying hair and a beard is visible in the driver\\'s seat. He appears to be middle-aged and has a serious, perhaps concerned, expression. He is wearing a light brown or tan collared shirt or jacket.  His hands are on the steering wheel, suggesting that the car is either about to move or has recently stopped.\\n* **The Passengers:** Three other individuals are seated in the car alongside the driver. A woman with shoulder-length, light brown or graying hair is seated in the front passenger seat. She appears to be middle-aged and has a worried or anxious expression. She is wearing a checkered shirt or blouse.  Behind them, two other faces are partially visible, one appearing to be a young man with darker hair. Their expressions are less clear, but they seem to share the overall tense atmosphere of the scene.\\n\\n**Narrative suggestions:**\\n\\nThe image\\'s dramatic lighting, composition, and the expressions of the individuals create a sense of narrative tension. It suggests a story unfolding, perhaps a journey interrupted, a moment of crisis, or a tense family dynamic. The vintage car and the characters\\' attire hint at a specific time period, possibly the mid-20th century, adding a layer of historical context to the narrative possibilities.\\n\\n**Possible interpretations:**\\n\\n* **A Road Trip Gone Wrong:** The car, the darkness, and the anxious expressions suggest a journey that has encountered an obstacle or unexpected event. The open car door could indicate a recent arrival or a hasty departure.\\n* **Family Drama:** The combination of different generations within the car and the varied expressions could point to a family conflict or a shared moment of anxiety.\\n* **A Theatrical Performance:** The dramatic lighting and the posed nature of the image suggest a scene from a play or film. The black background reinforces this interpretation, resembling a stage backdrop.\\n* **A Symbolic Representation:** The car could symbolize a journey through life, with the occupants representing different stages or challenges. The young woman outside the car might symbolize a detached observer or a future generation.\\n\\n\\n**Keywords for image retrieval:**\\n\\nvintage car, night, darkness, dramatic lighting, family, road trip, tension, anxiety, theater, film still, 1950s, 1960s,  retro, classic car, portrait, group portrait, storytelling, narrative, mystery, suspense, black background, chiaroscuro,  worried expressions,  open car door,  registration sticker\\n\\n\\nThis detailed description aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the image, covering its technical aspects, subject matter, and potential interpretations.

       "   'description': 'This dynamic image captures a pivotal moment during a basketball game, likely a professional or international match, given the setting and the players\\' uniforms. The focus is on an airborne player attempting a shot, with other players reacting around him. The image is rich in detail, offering a glimpse into the intensity and athleticism of the sport.\\n\\n**Central Action:**\\n\\nThe primary subject is a male basketball player in mid-air, seemingly about to shoot the ball. His body is extended, his right arm raised high with the ball positioned for release, and his gaze fixed on the basket (which is out of frame). He wears a green and gold jersey with the word \"AUSTRALIA\" prominently displayed across the chest, suggesting he\\'s representing the Australian national team. Below that, the word \"IGNET\" is visible, likely a sponsor\\'s name. His facial expression is one of focused determination. His curly hair is visible atop his head. His legs are spread wide, with his right leg extended forward and his left leg slightly bent. He wears pink and gray basketball shoes, white socks, and green and gold shorts.\\n\\n**Other Players:**\\n\\nAnother player, wearing a white jersey with blue and yellow accents and the word \"Venezuela\" printed on it, is positioned beneath the Australian player. He appears to be defending the shot, his body leaning back and his head tilted upwards to follow the ball\\'s trajectory. This player is bald and has darker skin than the Australian player. He wears multi-colored, striped shorts, purple, green, and pink basketball shoes, and white socks.\\n\\nA third player, also wearing a Venezuelan jersey, is partially visible in the background. He has long, curly brown hair and is watching the action unfold. He also wears multi-colored, striped shorts and white socks.\\n\\nA fourth player, wearing a Venezuelan jersey, is visible on the right side of the image. He is further in the background and appears to be moving towards the basket.\\n\\n**Setting and Background:**\\n\\nThe game is being played in a large indoor arena, evidenced by the bright overhead lighting and the blurred crowd in the background. The court is a polished wooden surface, with various markings visible. The arena lights are arranged in a circular pattern, creating a dramatic effect. The background shows a large crowd of spectators, blurred due to the focus being on the players in the foreground. The arena\\'s structure, including railings and other infrastructure, is also partially visible. The overall impression is one of a professional, well-equipped venue.\\n\\n**Technical Aspects:**\\n\\n* **Focus:** The image is sharply focused on the Australian player, with the Venezuelan defender also in relatively sharp focus. The background and other players are progressively blurred, creating a sense of depth and emphasizing the main action.\\n* **Lighting:** The lighting is bright and even, typical of indoor sports photography. The overhead arena lights contribute to the dramatic atmosphere.\\n* **Composition:** The composition is dynamic, capturing the movement and energy of the game. The diagonal lines created by the players\\' bodies and limbs add to the sense of action.\\n* **Color:** The image features vibrant colors, including the green and gold of the Australian jersey, the blue and yellow of the Venezuelan jersey, and the warm tones of the wooden court.\\n\\n**Possible Narrative:**\\n\\nThe image tells a story of a crucial moment in the basketball game. The Australian player is attempting a potentially game-changing shot, while the Venezuelan defender tries to block it. The outcome of the shot remains unknown, adding to the suspense captured in the image.\\n\\n**Keywords for Retrieval:**\\n\\nBasketball, Australia, Venezuela, game, sport, action, jump shot, defense, arena, players, uniform, competition, athleticism, dynamic, energy, international, professional, FIBA, World Cup, qualifiers.\\n\\n\\n**Detailed Description for Retrieval (1500+ words):**\\n\\nThis image encapsulates the raw energy and intense competition of a basketball game, likely a high-stakes match between Australia and Venezuela. The photograph freezes a dynamic moment where an Australian player is suspended mid-air, poised to release a shot, while a Venezuelan defender closely guards him.  The background reveals a bustling indoor arena, packed with spectators, highlighting the significance of the event.\\n\\n**The Australian Offensive Player:**\\n\\nThe focal point of the image is the Australian player executing a jump shot. His upward trajectory, extended arm, and focused gaze towards the unseen basket (out of frame) convey the determination and precision required for this crucial play. His green and gold uniform, emblazoned with \"AUSTRALIA,\" clearly identifies his national affiliation. The \"IGNET\" marking on his jersey likely signifies a team sponsor.  His facial expression, a mixture of concentration and exertion, reflects the physical and mental demands of professional basketball. His curly hair adds a touch of individuality to his athletic persona. His legs are splayed, demonstrating the athleticism and balance required for an in-air shot. His pink and gray basketball shoes, along with the white socks and green and gold shorts, complete his uniform.\\n\\n**The Venezuelan Defensive Player:**\\n\\nDirectly beneath the airborne Australian player is a Venezuelan defender. His upward gaze and slightly reclined posture indicate his attempt to contest the shot. His white jersey, accented with blue and yellow stripes and the \"Venezuela\" inscription, signifies his national team. His bald head and darker skin tone contrast with the Australian player, adding visual diversity to the scene. His multi-colored, striped shorts, along with the purple, green, and pink basketball shoes and white socks, complete his uniform. His presence adds a layer of tension and competition to the image, encapsulating the back-and-forth nature of basketball.\\n\\n**Other Players and Background Action:**\\n\\nThe image also captures glimpses of other players on the court, all clad in Venezuelan uniforms, suggesting this is a possession where Venezuela is on defense.  One player with long, curly brown hair is visible in the mid-ground, observing the action intently. Another player is seen on the right side of the frame, seemingly moving towards the basket, possibly anticipating a rebound. These secondary figures contribute to the overall sense of a live, dynamic game in progress.\\n\\nThe backdrop of the image reveals a large indoor arena, filled with a blurred crowd of spectators. The arena\\'s bright lighting illuminates the court, creating a dramatic setting for the action. The polished wooden floor, marked with game lines, reflects the light, adding a sense of professionalism and high-stakes competition. The blurred crowd in the background adds depth and scale to the image, emphasizing the public nature of the event.  The arena\\'s infrastructure, including railings and other structural elements, is partially visible, providing context for the setting.\\n\\n**Technical Analysis of the Image:**\\n\\n* **Focus and Depth of Field:** The sharp focus is primarily on the Australian player executing the shot and the Venezuelan defender contesting it. The background, including the crowd and other players, is intentionally blurred, creating a shallow depth of field that draws the viewer\\'s attention to the central action. This technique effectively isolates the key players and emphasizes the dynamism of the moment.\\n\\n* **Lighting and Exposure:** The image is well-exposed, with balanced lighting that captures the details of the players and the arena. The bright overhead lights create a dramatic atmosphere and highlight the players\\' movements. The lighting also enhances the vibrancy of the team colors, adding to the visual appeal of the photograph.\\n\\n* **Composition and Framing:** The composition is dynamic and engaging, with the diagonal lines created by the players\\' bodies and limbs adding to the sense of motion and energy. The framing focuses on the crucial moment of the jump shot, capturing the athleticism and intensity of the players.\\n\\n* **Color Palette:** The image features a rich color palette, with the contrasting green and gold of the Australian uniform and the blue, yellow, and white of the Venezuelan uniform. The warm tones of the wooden court and the bright white of the arena lights create a visually appealing contrast.\\n\\n**Narrative and Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe image tells a story of a critical moment in a basketball game between Australia and Venezuela. The Australian player\\'s jump shot represents a potential scoring opportunity, while the Venezuelan defender\\'s close guarding signifies the defensive effort to prevent it. The outcome of the shot remains unresolved within the frame, adding an element of suspense and anticipation. The image captures the essence of basketball as a fast-paced, dynamic sport, highlighting the athleticism, skill, and competition inherent in the game.\\n\\n**Keywords for Image Retrieval:**\\n\\nBasketball, Australia national team, Venezuela national team, FIBA, international basketball, sports photography, action shot, jump shot, defense, arena, crowd, competition, athleticism, dynamic, energy, game action, professional sports, sports, team sports, ball sports,  FIBA World Cup Qualifiers.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': 'This illustration depicts a symbolic representation of control and manipulation, possibly in a corporate or hierarchical setting. It features two central figures: a dominant figure resembling a stereotypical capitalist and a subordinate figure seemingly under their influence. The image employs a stark black and white contrast with a single splash of blue, further emphasizing the power dynamic.\\n\\n**Dominant Figure (Capitalist):**\\n\\n* **Attire:** Dressed in a classic capitalist uniform, this figure wears a dark, bowler hat, a dark suit, and a pointed collar shirt with a dark tie. This attire evokes imagery of traditional business and finance, suggesting wealth, power, and authority. The dark, solid colors contribute to an impression of seriousness and perhaps even a lack of transparency.\\n\\n* **Facial Features:** The face is stylized and simplified, with thin, arched eyebrows, small, beady eyes, and a long, pointed nose. The mouth is curved into a subtle, almost smug smile, hinting at a sense of self-satisfaction or control. The overall expression is one of shrewdness and calculation.\\n\\n* **Gesture:** The figure\\'s hand is raised to its chin in a classic gesture of contemplation or perhaps concealed amusement. This gesture, combined with the smile, reinforces the impression of someone who is in control and observing the situation with a detached amusement.\\n\\n* **Body Language:** While the face and hand are visible, the rest of the body is mostly obscured by the dark suit. This adds to the figure\\'s air of mystery and power, as if their true intentions are hidden. The figure\\'s large size relative to the subordinate figure further emphasizes their dominance.\\n\\n**Subordinate Figure (Worker):**\\n\\n* **Attire:** In stark contrast to the capitalist, this figure wears a simple, plain blue long-sleeved shirt. This simplicity suggests a lack of status or power. The blue color, while a departure from the otherwise monochrome palette, does not necessarily represent positivity. In this context, it could symbolize conformity, subservience, or even melancholy.\\n\\n* **Facial Features:** The face, like the capitalist\\'s, is stylized. The eyebrows are furrowed, and the eyes are wide and slightly crossed, conveying confusion, stress, or perhaps even a mild sense of panic. The mouth is downturned in a frown, further emphasizing their negative emotional state.\\n\\n* **Head:** The most striking feature of this figure is the metal jar lid placed on their head. This lid acts as a visual metaphor for being \"capped,\" \"sealed,\" or limited in their thinking and potential. The arrows circling the lid suggest a cyclical, repetitive process, possibly representing the limitations imposed on the worker\\'s thoughts and actions.\\n\\n* **Gesture:** The figure\\'s hands are raised in a gesture of helplessness or confusion. This gesture, combined with the facial expression, portrays a sense of being trapped or controlled.\\n\\n* **Body Language:** The figure\\'s overall posture is slightly hunched, suggesting resignation or defeat. Their smaller size compared to the capitalist reinforces their subordinate position.\\n\\n**Giant Hand and the Act of \"Capping\":**\\n\\nA large, disembodied hand, presumably belonging to the capitalist, extends from the top of the frame and places the jar lid on the worker\\'s head. This act is central to the image\\'s meaning, visually representing the act of controlling or limiting someone\\'s thoughts and potential. The hand\\'s large size and dark color further emphasize the power imbalance.\\n\\n**Overall Composition and Meaning:**\\n\\nThe composition of the image, with the capitalist looming over the smaller worker, clearly establishes a hierarchy of power. The act of placing the lid on the worker\\'s head is a powerful visual metaphor for control and manipulation. The contrasting attire, facial expressions, and body language further reinforce this message.\\n\\n**Possible Interpretations:**\\n\\nThis illustration can be interpreted in several ways, all revolving around the theme of control and limitation:\\n\\n* **Corporate Control:** The image could represent the control that corporations exert over their employees, limiting their creativity and independence. The jar lid symbolizes the restrictions placed on workers\\' thinking and potential.\\n\\n* **Societal Constraints:** It could also represent broader societal pressures that limit individual expression and thought. The capitalist figure could symbolize the forces of conformity and tradition.\\n\\n* **Political Manipulation:** The illustration could be interpreted as a commentary on political manipulation, where those in power control the narrative and limit dissenting opinions.\\n\\n* **Suppression of Innovation:** The image could also represent the suppression of innovative ideas and independent thinking. The jar lid symbolizes the stifling of creativity and progress.\\n\\n**The Text \"LETCH\":**\\n\\nThe word \"LETCH\" appears in the bottom right corner of the image. This word, often associated with inappropriate or excessive sexual desire, adds another layer of complexity to the interpretation. It could suggest that the control being exerted is driven by a base desire for power or dominance. Alternatively, it could be a commentary on the exploitative nature of certain power dynamics.\\n\\n**Overall Impact:**\\n\\nThe image\\'s stark black and white contrast, combined with the single splash of blue and the powerful visual metaphor of the jar lid, creates a striking and memorable image. It effectively communicates the complex themes of control, manipulation, and limitation, leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. The inclusion of the word \"LETCH\" adds a further layer of intrigue and encourages deeper reflection on the nature of power and its potential abuses.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': 'This wide-angle, low-angle shot captures a group of individuals standing in front of a distinctive brick church. The photograph is taken under a clear, sunny sky, with the sun positioned high and slightly to the left, casting a bright light that creates a slight lens flare around a nearby utility pole. The overall composition and lighting suggest a daytime scene in a possibly urban or suburban setting.\\n\\n**The Church:**\\n\\nThe church dominates the background, its architectural details prominent. The structure is primarily constructed of dark red and brown bricks laid in a patterned design, which includes decorative elements around the arched windows and entranceways.  These patterns appear to be geometric and possibly symbolic, adding to the visual interest of the building.  The church features a tall, pointed steeple typical of Gothic or Victorian-era architecture, topped with a dark, possibly slate roof.  A smaller, secondary tower is also visible, adding to the complexity of the roofline.  The arched windows, some boarded up, suggest that the building may be undergoing renovations or is currently unused.  The brickwork shows signs of weathering and age, contributing to the church\\'s historical character. Above the main entrance, a faded inscription is visible, possibly indicating the year of construction or dedication. Roman numerals are discernible, suggesting a historical date.\\n\\n**The People:**\\n\\nEight individuals stand before the church, their expressions ranging from neutral to slightly smiling. Their attire is casual, suggesting an informal gathering or community event. The group includes both men and women of varying ages, creating a sense of diversity.  Some individuals wear hats, and their clothing styles vary, from t-shirts and jeans to more layered outfits.  The person positioned near the center, presumably the focal point, is a man dressed in a light blue, long-sleeved shirt. He appears to be middle-aged and stands with his hands in his pockets, looking directly at the camera.  The positioning of the individuals suggests a deliberate arrangement for the photograph, possibly related to their connection to the church or the purpose of the gathering.\\n\\n**The Foreground and Background:**\\n\\nThe foreground includes part of a white vehicle, likely a van or SUV, parked to the left of the group.  A utility pole stands at the far left edge of the frame, with power lines stretching across the top of the image. The sun\\'s glare on the pole creates a stark contrast against the blue sky.  To the right of the church, a palm tree is partially visible, adding a touch of greenery to the scene.  The background, beyond the church, reveals a glimpse of other buildings and trees, suggesting a built-up environment.\\n\\n**Technical Aspects:**\\n\\n* **Perspective:** The low-angle shot emphasizes the height of the church and creates a sense of grandeur.\\n* **Lighting:** The bright sunlight creates strong contrasts and highlights the textures of the brickwork.\\n* **Focus:** The image appears to be in sharp focus throughout, capturing details in both the foreground and background.\\n* **Composition:** The church is the central element, with the people arranged in front, creating a balanced composition.\\n* **Color:** The image exhibits a natural color palette, with the warm tones of the brick contrasting against the blue sky and the green of the palm tree.\\n\\n**Possible Interpretations:**\\n\\nThe image could be documenting a community gathering, a protest, or a press conference related to the church.  The presence of the boarded-up windows suggests a possible story related to the church\\'s current state or future plans. The casual attire of the individuals and their positioning in front of the church imply a connection to the building, possibly as members of the congregation, local residents, or activists involved in its preservation. The inclusion of the utility pole and street sign adds a layer of realism and situates the scene within a specific urban context. The visible text on the street sign indicates restrictions on alcohol consumption in public places, providing a detail about local regulations.  The overall impression is one of a community or group united in their connection to the church building, possibly advocating for its preservation or repurposing.\\n\\n**Detailed Description of Individuals:**\\n\\n1. **Man in Maroon Shirt and Hat:**  Older man with a light tan fedora and a maroon long-sleeved shirt. He has a white/grey beard and is looking slightly down.\\n\\n2. **Person in Red Top and Colorful Hat:**  Appears younger, possibly female, wearing a vibrant red top and a multicolored, patterned hat.\\n\\n3. **Young Man in Dark Grey Shirt:**  A young man with light brown hair, wearing a dark grey or black short-sleeved shirt. He appears relaxed and is looking directly at the camera.\\n\\n4. **Woman in Graphic Tee and Jeans:** A woman with long dark hair, wearing a graphic t-shirt with a circular design and light blue jeans.\\n\\n5. **Man in Light Blue Shirt (Central Figure):**  Middle-aged man with short light brown hair, wearing a light blue long-sleeved shirt and dark pants.  He appears to be the focal point of the group.\\n\\n6. **Man in Black T-shirt with Circular Logo:**  Younger man with shoulder-length light brown hair and a beard, wearing a black t-shirt with a white circular logo and dark pants. He\\'s wearing a dark baseball cap.\\n\\n7. **Man in Grey T-shirt with Beverage:**  Older man with short grey hair, wearing a grey t-shirt and holding a disposable coffee cup.\\n\\n8. **Woman in Dark Grey T-shirt with \"Norton\" Logo:**  Woman with blonde hair and sunglasses, wearing a dark grey t-shirt with a white \"Norton\" logo and light blue jeans.  She has a brown shoulder bag.\\n\\n**Additional Observations:**\\n\\nThe boarded-up windows of the church are a significant detail, raising questions about the building\\'s current status. The presence of the group in front of the church suggests a possible connection to its fate.  The image could be interpreted as a visual statement about community, preservation, or even protest. The inclusion of the street sign adds a layer of detail about the location and its regulations. The overall composition and lighting contribute to a sense of both historical significance and contemporary relevance.\\n',\n",

The focus is sharp on the player, while the background, filled with spectators, is blurred, emphasizing the action on the field.\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed breakdown of the image:\\n\\n**Player:**\\n\\n* **Appearance:** The player is a young, Caucasian male with a distinctive \"skullet\" hairstyle – short on the sides and long in the back.  He has a light mustache and his expression is one of jubilation, with his mouth open in a shout and eyes wide.  His skin is glistening with sweat, indicating the physical exertion of the game. There\\'s visible dirt or mud on his shorts, further emphasizing the on-field action.\\n* **Attire:** He wears the Essendon Football Club jersey, which is predominantly black with a red sash running diagonally from the left shoulder to the right hip. The club\\'s logo is visible on the chest, a stylized \"EFC\" emblem with \"Essendon FC\" and \"150 Years\" written beneath it, suggesting a commemorative jersey. The jersey also features the AFL (Australian Football League) logo and the \"Amart Furniture\" sponsor logo prominently displayed. He wears white shorts with black trim, also bearing the Essendon logo and possibly a smaller sponsor logo.  A thin wristband is visible on his right wrist.\\n* **Action:** The player is in motion, his right leg extended forward as if mid-stride. His right arm is bent at the elbow, fist clenched in a celebratory gesture. His left arm is slightly bent and held away from his body, contributing to the sense of movement and dynamism.\\n* **Emotion:** The player\\'s facial expression and body language clearly convey a strong sense of triumph and excitement.  The open mouth, clenched fist, and forward momentum suggest a moment of intense emotion following a successful play.\\n\\n**Background:**\\n\\n* **Blur:** The background is significantly out of focus, creating a bokeh effect that isolates the player and draws attention to him. This blurring suggests a stadium setting filled with spectators.\\n* **Colors:** The blurred background features muted tones of red, likely from the stadium seating or team colors of the opposing side. Darker areas suggest shadows and the general ambiance of a nighttime or evening game under stadium lights.\\n* **Lack of Detail:** Due to the blur, no individual spectators or specific stadium features are discernible. This reinforces the focus on the player and the immediacy of his celebration.\\n\\n**Technical Aspects:**\\n\\n* **Focus:** The sharp focus on the player contrasts with the blurred background, creating a strong sense of depth and isolating the subject.\\n* **Lighting:** The lighting appears to be artificial stadium lighting, contributing to the overall atmosphere of a professional sporting event. The light reflects off the player\\'s sweaty skin, enhancing the sense of action and exertion.\\n* **Composition:** The image is cropped relatively tightly around the player, further emphasizing his action and emotion. The diagonal line of his running motion and the sash on his jersey create dynamic lines within the frame.\\n* **Color Saturation:** The colors are vibrant and realistic, capturing the intensity of the moment. The red of the jersey and the subtle variations in the blurred background contribute to the overall visual appeal.\\n\\n\\n**Keywords for Retrieval:**\\n\\n* Australian Rules Football\\n* AFL\\n* Essendon Football Club\\n* Celebration\\n* Sport\\n* Action\\n* Player\\n* Running\\n* Jersey\\n* Skullet\\n* Mustache\\n* Stadium\\n* Blurred Background\\n* Dynamic\\n* Emotion\\n* Amart Furniture (Sponsor)\\n* Under Armour (Apparel)\\n\\n\\n**Extended Description for Enhanced Retrieval:**\\n\\nThis image encapsulates the raw emotion and physicality of Australian Rules Football. The Essendon player, caught in a moment of pure elation, embodies the spirit of competition and the thrill of victory. The blurred stadium background adds context, placing the viewer in the midst of the electric atmosphere of a live match.  The player\\'s distinctive hairstyle and the commemorative \"150 Years\" logo on his jersey offer potential clues for identifying the specific game and year. The prominent display of the \"Amart Furniture\" sponsorship highlights the commercial aspect of professional sports. The image is ideal for use in sports media, team publications, or marketing materials related to the AFL or Essendon Football Club. It could also be used in broader contexts related to athleticism, celebration, and the emotional intensity of competitive sports. The image\\'s technical qualities, including the sharp focus on the player and the blurred background, make it visually compelling and suitable for a variety of applications.

His eyes are light blue and appear focused, likely directed at someone off-camera.\\n\\n* **Attire:** Lankford is dressed in a dark navy blue or black suit jacket, paired with a light blue shirt. A small portion of a red tie with white polka dots is visible at the open collar.

       "   'description': 'This image depicts a slightly blurred figure, likely a woman, walking in a public space, possibly a shopping area. The focus is soft, suggesting either motion blur or a deliberate blurring for privacy reasons. The woman is the central subject, occupying the middle ground of the composition.\\n\\n**Subject:**\\n\\n* **Appearance:** The woman appears to have shoulder-length light brown hair.  She is wearing a light-colored, possibly white or light gray, blazer or jacket. The details of her clothing beneath the jacket are obscured by the blur.  It\\'s impossible to determine her age, ethnicity, or other specific features due to the blurring.\\n* **Posture and Movement:** She seems to be walking, her body oriented slightly towards the right side of the frame. Her arms are not clearly visible, likely held close to her body.  The blur suggests movement, giving the impression she is walking at a moderate pace.\\n* **Blur:** The significant blur around the woman\\'s face and body is the most prominent feature of the image. This blur effectively obscures her identity, making it impossible to recognize her. This type of blurring is often used in media to protect the privacy of individuals who are not public figures or when their identity is not relevant to the story.\\n\\n**Background and Setting:**\\n\\n* **Urban Environment:** The background suggests an urban setting, likely a shopping street or mall.  The out-of-focus elements include storefronts and displays.\\n* **Signage:**  A partially visible sign with the word \"WAREHOUSE\" in large, bold, capital letters is a key element in the background.  The sign is predominantly red and orange, creating a vibrant color contrast against the lighter clothing of the subject and the darker background elements.  This suggests the location may be near or within a retail store or shopping complex.\\n* **Other People:**  Blurred figures of other people can be seen in the background, further reinforcing the impression of a busy public space.  One figure to the left appears to be a man wearing a light-colored shirt, possibly white.  These figures are too indistinct to provide any further details.\\n* **Architectural Elements:** Vertical lines and dark surfaces in the background suggest architectural elements like pillars or doorways. These elements contribute to the depth of the image and reinforce the urban setting.\\n* **Lighting:** The lighting appears to be natural daylight, possibly filtered through a covering or awning. The overall brightness and slight shadows suggest a daytime scene.\\n\\n**Composition and Technical Aspects:**\\n\\n* **Focus:** The shallow depth of field, with the subject slightly sharper than the background, draws attention to the woman while still providing context.\\n* **Blur:** As previously mentioned, the blur is a defining characteristic of this image. It likely results from a combination of motion blur and intentional blurring for privacy.\\n* **Color Palette:** The image features a relatively muted color palette, with the exception of the red and orange of the \"WAREHOUSE\" sign. The woman\\'s light clothing contrasts with the darker background elements.\\n* **Perspective:** The image is taken from a relatively close perspective, placing the viewer near the subject. This perspective, combined with the blur, creates a sense of immediacy and movement.\\n\\n**Possible Interpretations and Context:**\\n\\n* **Privacy Protection:** The most likely reason for the blur is to protect the identity of the woman. This is common practice in journalism and media when depicting individuals who are not public figures or when their identity is not relevant to the story.\\n* **Street Photography:** The image could be a candid street photograph, capturing a moment of everyday life in an urban setting. The blur might be an artistic choice or a result of the shooting conditions.\\n* **News or Documentary Context:**  The image might be a still from a news report or documentary.  The \"WAREHOUSE\" sign could be a clue to the location or the subject of the report.  For example, the report might be about retail, consumer behavior, or urban life.\\n\\n**Keywords for Image Retrieval:**\\n\\n* Woman, blurred, privacy, urban, street, shopping, warehouse, sign, walking, motion blur, candid, city, public space, retail, daytime, people, background, architecture.\\n\\n\\n**Detailed Description for Retrieval (1500+ words):**\\n\\nThis image presents a scene of urban life, focusing on a blurred figure, presumably female, traversing a public space. The technical and compositional elements of the photograph contribute to a sense of anonymity and movement, while the background details hint at a commercial or retail environment.\\n\\nThe central subject, the woman, is rendered almost ghost-like by the heavy blur applied to her form.  This blurring effect immediately draws the viewer\\'s attention while simultaneously obscuring her identity.  It raises questions: Why is her face blurred? Is she a private individual incidentally captured in a public moment? Or is there a deliberate intention to conceal her identity for reasons related to the context in which this image is presented?\\n\\nThe blur is not uniform.  While her face is almost completely obscured, the outline of her body and clothing remains discernible.  She appears to be wearing a light-colored jacket, possibly white or a light shade of gray, which contrasts with the darker tones of the background.  The jacket appears to be of a classic, simple cut, reaching down to her hips or slightly below.  The details of any clothing beneath the jacket are lost in the blur.  Her hair, also blurred, seems to be a medium-length, light brown shade.  She appears to be walking at a moderate pace, her body angled slightly towards the right side of the frame.  Her arms are not clearly visible, likely held close to her side, adding to the impression of purposeful movement.\\n\\nThe background of the image provides context and anchors the subject within a specific environment.  The most striking element is the partially visible sign bearing the word \"WAREHOUSE\" in large, bold, capital letters.  The sign\\'s color scheme, a vibrant combination of red and orange, stands out against the more muted tones of the surrounding scene.  This sign immediately suggests a retail or commercial setting, possibly a large store or shopping complex.  The presence of this sign raises further questions about the context of the image.  Is the woman simply passing by the store, or is her presence in some way related to the \"WAREHOUSE\"?\\n\\nBeyond the prominent sign, the background is a tapestry of blurred shapes and colors, indicative of a busy urban environment.  The out-of-focus elements suggest other storefronts, displays, and architectural details.  Vertical lines and dark surfaces hint at the presence of pillars, doorways, or other structural elements, adding depth and complexity to the scene.  The blurred figures of other individuals can be seen in the background, further reinforcing the impression of a public space bustling with activity.  One figure to the left of the frame appears to be a man wearing a light-colored shirt.  However, like the central subject, these figures are too indistinct to offer any further details about their appearance or actions.\\n\\nThe lighting in the image suggests a daytime scene.  The overall brightness and the subtle play of shadows indicate natural daylight, possibly filtered through an awning or overhead structure.  This natural lighting contributes to the realistic feel of the image, capturing a fleeting moment in the flow of urban life.\\n\\nFrom a technical perspective, the image exhibits a shallow depth of field.  The woman, though blurred, is slightly sharper than the background elements, which are rendered in softer focus.  This technique draws the viewer\\'s attention to the subject while still providing a sense of place and context.  The blur itself likely results from a combination of motion blur, caused by the movement of the woman as the photograph was taken, and intentional blurring applied in post-processing, presumably to protect her privacy.\\n\\nThe color palette of the image is relatively restrained, dominated by muted tones of gray, brown, and white.  The exception is the vibrant red and orange of the \"WAREHOUSE\" sign, which serves as a focal point and injects a splash of color into the scene.  The woman\\'s light-colored jacket further contributes to the contrast between light and dark elements within the frame.\\n\\nThe perspective of the image is relatively close, placing the viewer in a position of near proximity to the subject.  This perspective, combined with the blur and the sense of movement, creates a feeling of immediacy and almost accidental capture.  It\\'s as if the photographer has caught a glimpse of the woman in mid-stride, a fleeting moment in the rhythm of city life.\\n\\nThe image\\'s ambiguity invites speculation about its intended purpose and meaning.  The most plausible interpretation is that the blur serves to protect the privacy of the woman, a common practice in media when depicting individuals who are not public figures or whose identity is not essential to the story being told.  Alternatively, the image could be a piece of street photography, capturing a spontaneous moment of urban life.  The blur, in this case, might be an artistic choice, adding a layer of mystery and intrigue to the scene.  Another possibility is that the image is a still from a news report or documentary, with the \"WAREHOUSE\" sign serving as a clue to the subject matter.  The report could be about retail, consumer behavior, or the dynamics of urban life.\\n\\nRegardless of its specific context, the image effectively captures a sense of anonymity and movement within a busy urban environment. The blur, the prominent signage, and the blurred background figures all contribute to a feeling of transience and the constant flow of activity that characterizes city life.  The image invites the viewer to contemplate the stories unfolding within this public space and the lives of the individuals who pass through it, even as their identities remain obscured.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': 'This image captures a dramatic performance by Justin Broadrick, the frontman of the influential industrial metal band Godflesh. The photograph is rich with atmospheric detail, focusing on Broadrick amidst a dimly lit stage bathed in intensely colored lighting.\\n\\n**Technical aspects and composition:**\\n\\n* **Lighting:** The dominant light source is a deep, saturated blue that washes over the entire scene, creating a moody and intense atmosphere. This blue light is contrasted by strong red highlights, particularly on Broadrick\\'s face and guitar, giving him a stark, almost demonic appearance. The interplay of these two colors creates a visually striking contrast and adds to the dramatic feel of the performance. The background is kept significantly darker, allowing Broadrick to stand out as the focal point. This use of light and shadow contributes to the overall sense of depth and intensity.\\n* **Focus and Depth of Field:** The image is sharply focused on Broadrick, with his face and upper body being the clearest elements. The guitar is also in relatively sharp focus, emphasizing its importance in the scene. The background elements, including other band members and equipment, are blurred, creating a shallow depth of field. This technique further isolates Broadrick and draws the viewer\\'s attention to him.\\n* **Angle and Perspective:** The photograph is taken from a slightly low angle, looking up at Broadrick. This perspective adds to his imposing presence and gives the viewer a sense of being in the audience, looking up at the performer.\\n* **Color Palette:** The limited color palette of deep blue, red, and black creates a powerful visual impact. The blue evokes a sense of coldness and darkness, while the red adds a touch of aggression and intensity. The black backdrop provides a sense of depth and mystery.\\n* **Composition:** The composition is relatively simple, with Broadrick positioned slightly off-center. This asymmetry adds dynamism to the image and avoids a static feel. The lines of the guitar neck lead the viewer\\'s eye towards Broadrick\\'s face, further emphasizing him as the central subject.\\n\\n**Subject and Details:**\\n\\n* **Justin Broadrick:** The central figure is Justin Broadrick, a prominent figure in the industrial metal and experimental music scene. He is known for his innovative and often abrasive sound, pushing the boundaries of heavy music.  He is the founder and driving force behind Godflesh, a band known for its pioneering blend of heavy metal, industrial music, and electronic elements.  His work has been highly influential on countless other artists in the genre.\\n* **Facial Expression and Makeup:** Broadrick\\'s facial expression is one of intense emotion, with his mouth open in what appears to be a shout or vocalization.  His face is painted with black markings, possibly resembling tribal or ritualistic designs, which enhance the dramatic and somewhat theatrical nature of his performance. These markings, combined with the red lighting, give him an almost otherworldly appearance.\\n* **Clothing:** He is wearing a dark jacket or suit, which adds to the formal yet unconventional aesthetic. The dark clothing contrasts with the vibrant lighting, making him stand out even more. A noticeable detail is a patch or badge on his jacket, featuring a square and compass symbol, commonly associated with Freemasonry.  The inclusion of this symbol adds a layer of intrigue and symbolism to the image, potentially referencing themes of esotericism or hidden knowledge often explored in Broadrick\\'s music.\\n* **Guitar:** Broadrick is holding an electric guitar, which is prominently featured in the image. The guitar is a key element of his musical expression, and its presence reinforces his identity as a musician and performer. The red lighting accentuates the guitar\\'s shape and color, making it a visually striking element. The headstock of the guitar bears a \"Z\" logo, which is likely the logo of the guitar brand or a custom design.\\n* **Microphone:** A microphone is positioned in front of Broadrick\\'s mouth, capturing his vocals. This reinforces the context of a live performance and emphasizes the auditory aspect of his art.\\n\\n**Overall Impression and Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe image conveys a powerful sense of energy, intensity, and theatricality.

       "   'description': 'This vibrant image captures a scene from a theatrical performance, likely a play or musical, with three actors prominently featured against a vivid blue backdrop. The composition and costumes suggest a narrative with elements of fantasy or mythology, possibly incorporating indigenous Australian themes.\\n\\n**Detailed Description of the Actors and Costumes:**\\n\\n* **Leftmost Actor (Female):**\\xa0A young woman with dark, curly hair pulled back from her face is positioned on the left side of the image. Her expression is one of concern or apprehension, her eyes wide and focused on something off-stage. She wears a simple, light-colored, horizontally striped shirt and brown overalls, suggesting a practical, everyday attire. A long pendant, possibly made of bone or a similar natural material, hangs around her neck. This costuming might indicate a character connected to nature or a simpler way of life.\\n\\n* **Central Actor (Male):**\\xa0This actor is the most striking, positioned centrally and dominating the image\\'s vertical space. He appears to be shirtless, with his body decorated with white paint or markings, possibly referencing indigenous Australian body painting traditions. The markings are not intricate or clearly defined in this image, but they contribute to the overall impression of ritual or cultural significance.\\xa0He wears black knee and shin guards, perhaps suggesting a warrior or protector role. Most notably, he wears a headpiece consisting of a stylized animal mask resembling a kangaroo or wallaby perched atop a dark, helmet-like structure. The mask is light brown and appears to be made of fabric or a similar soft material. This combination of elements creates a powerful, otherworldly presence.\\n\\n* **Rightmost Actor (Male):**\\xa0A young man with curly brown hair is situated on the right. He wears a light-colored t-shirt with a horizontal two-toned design – the upper part appears to be off-white or light gray, while the lower section is a darker gray or greenish-gray. He seems to be looking upwards and slightly to the left, his expression a mixture of surprise and curiosity. His attire is contemporary and casual, contrasting with the more stylized costumes of the other actors.\\n\\n**Setting and Background:**\\n\\nThe backdrop is a deep, vibrant blue, evoking a sense of open sky or water. Indistinct lighter patches on the backdrop could represent clouds or underwater light effects.\\xa0A large, off-white, triangular piece of fabric hangs down from the top left corner of the frame, resembling a sail or a piece of a tent. Its placement and appearance contribute to the sense of movement and adventure, suggesting a journey or a scene taking place outdoors. The actors appear to be standing on or behind a raised platform or stage edge, partially obscured by a curved, reddish-brown structure that runs along the bottom of the frame. This structure\\'s texture appears rough, possibly resembling earth or rock.\\n\\n**Overall Impression and Possible Narrative:**\\n\\nThe image evokes a sense of storytelling and drama. The contrasting costumes and expressions suggest a narrative involving different worlds or perspectives. The central figure, with his animal mask and body paint, is a focal point, possibly representing a spirit guide, a mythical creature, or a character deeply connected to the natural world. The female actor\\'s concerned expression and the male actor\\'s look of surprise suggest they are reacting to an unfolding event or the appearance of the central figure. The \"sail\" in the background further reinforces the impression of a journey or a moment of transition.\\n\\n**Keywords for Image Retrieval:**\\n\\n* Theatre\\n* Performance\\n* Stage\\n* Actors\\n* Costumes\\n* Mask\\n* Animal Mask\\n* Indigenous Australian\\n* Body Paint\\n* Sail\\n* Blue Backdrop\\n* Storytelling\\n* Drama\\n* Myth\\n* Fantasy\\n* Adventure\\n* Culture\\n* Expression\\n* Character\\n\\n**Expanded Description for Enhanced Retrieval:**\\n\\nThis image is rich with visual details that lend themselves to a more in-depth description for improved searchability.  The actors\\' expressions are key to understanding the potential narrative. The woman\\'s worried look suggests a sense of foreboding or concern for the situation unfolding. The man on the right\\'s upward gaze and open mouth convey a sense of awe or astonishment, perhaps at the appearance of the central figure. The central actor, though his face is partially obscured by the mask and paint, appears stoic and purposeful.\\n\\nThe costuming choices further enhance the narrative possibilities. The woman\\'s simple clothing suggests a connection to everyday life, while the man on the right\\'s modern attire might place him in a contemporary setting. The central actor\\'s costume, with its indigenous-inspired elements, is the most evocative, suggesting a link to ancient traditions or spiritual beliefs. The animal mask, a prominent feature, could symbolize a totem animal, a spirit guide, or a transformation.\\n\\nThe setting, with its deep blue backdrop and sail-like fabric, adds to the image\\'s dynamism. The blue could represent the sky, the ocean, or a more abstract representation of the unknown. The \"sail\" suggests movement, travel, or a transition between worlds. The reddish-brown structure at the bottom of the frame grounds the scene, possibly representing the earth or a physical boundary.\\n\\nThe overall composition of the image, with the central figure dominating the vertical space and the other actors flanking him, creates a sense of balance and tension. The contrasting costumes and expressions further emphasize this tension, hinting at a conflict or a meeting of different worlds.\\n\\nBy combining these detailed descriptions with the previously mentioned keywords, the image becomes more readily searchable and discoverable in large image databases.  This detailed analysis allows for more nuanced queries, increasing the likelihood of retrieving this specific image when searching for specific themes, costume elements, or emotional expressions within theatrical photography.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': \"This image features a portrait of Vladimir Putin, the current President of the Russian Federation. He is a prominent figure in global politics, known for his long tenure as Russia's leader and his assertive foreign policy.\\n\\n**Visual Description:**\\n\\nThe image presents a mid-shot of Putin, likely taken outdoors in a winter setting. He is facing slightly to his right, with his gaze directed in the same direction.  His expression appears serious and contemplative, perhaps even somber.\\n\\nHe wears a dark, heavy winter coat with a wide, fur-lined collar. The coat appears to be made of a dense, possibly wool or similar material, suitable for cold weather. The fur collar adds a touch of formality and also provides extra warmth. The coat is buttoned up, suggesting the chilliness of the environment.  A single button is visible near the center of the coat's closure.\\n\\nPutin's hair is neatly combed and appears light brown or grayish blonde. His complexion is fair, and his face shows some signs of age, with visible lines and wrinkles.\\n\\nThe background is out of focus, creating a bokeh effect. It appears to be a snowy landscape, with blurred white and gray tones suggesting trees or other vegetation in the distance. The blurred background draws attention to Putin's figure in the foreground. The light in the image is diffuse and even, likely on an overcast day, further enhancing the wintry atmosphere.  Small, dark specks are visible on Putin's coat and in the air, possibly snowflakes or dust particles caught in the light.\\n\\n**Contextual Information about Vladimir Putin:**\\n\\nVladimir Putin is a Russian politician and former intelligence officer who has served as the President of Russia since 2012, previously holding the position from 2000 to 2008. He was also Prime Minister from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012.\\n\\n**Putin's Political Career and Ideology:**\\n\\nPutin's political career began in the KGB, the Soviet Union's main security agency, where he worked for 16 years. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he entered politics in Saint Petersburg and quickly rose through the ranks.  His appointment as Prime Minister in 1999 and subsequent ascension to the presidency marked the beginning of his dominance in Russian politics.\\n\\nPutin's political ideology is often described as a form of conservative authoritarianism, characterized by a strong central government, emphasis on national sovereignty, and a socially conservative outlook. He has overseen a centralization of power in Russia, with increased control over the media, judiciary, and political opposition.\\n\\n**Key Events and Policies:**\\n\\nPutin's presidency has been marked by several key events and policies, including:\\n\\n* **Chechen Wars:** Putin's handling of the Second Chechen War, which began shortly after he took office, solidified his image as a strong leader and contributed to his initial popularity.\\n* **Economic Reforms:**  During the early 2000s, Russia experienced significant economic growth, fueled by rising oil prices. Putin implemented market-oriented reforms and stabilized the Russian economy after the turbulent 1990s.\\n* **Centralization of Power:** Putin's tenure has seen a gradual erosion of democratic institutions and a concentration of power in the presidency.  Critics have accused him of suppressing dissent and undermining the rule of law.\\n* **Foreign Policy Assertiveness:** Putin has pursued a more assertive foreign policy, challenging the perceived dominance of the United States and seeking to restore Russia's influence on the world stage. This has led to tensions with the West, particularly over issues such as the annexation of Crimea, the conflict in Ukraine, and alleged interference in foreign elections.\\n* **Social Conservatism:** Putin has promoted socially conservative values, including traditional family structures and the role of the Russian Orthodox Church in society.\\n\\n**Image Analysis and Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe image, with its wintry setting and Putin's serious expression, can be interpreted in various ways. The snowy backdrop could symbolize the coldness and isolation that some associate with Russian politics under Putin's leadership. His somber look might suggest the weight of his responsibilities or the challenges facing Russia.\\n\\nThe heavy winter coat conveys a sense of authority and resilience, perhaps reflecting Putin's image as a strong leader. The fur collar adds a touch of formality and reinforces the impression of power.\\n\\nThe blurred background and the focus on Putin's face emphasize his individual presence and importance. The image isolates him, visually reinforcing his position as the central figure in Russian politics.\\n\\n**Image Use Cases:**\\n\\nThis image could be used in various contexts, including:\\n\\n* **News articles:**  The image could accompany news reports about Putin, Russia, or international relations.\\n* **Political analysis:** The image could be used in articles or documentaries analyzing Putin's leadership, policies, and impact on Russia and the world.\\n* **Historical accounts:** The image could be included in historical records documenting Putin's presidency and his role in shaping contemporary Russia.\\n* **Biographical materials:** The image could be used in biographies or other publications focusing on Putin's life and career.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe image presents a powerful and evocative portrayal of Vladimir Putin. It captures his seriousness and authority, while also hinting at the complex and often controversial nature of his leadership. The wintry setting and the blurred background add to the image's symbolic weight, inviting viewers to reflect on Putin's role in shaping Russia's destiny and his impact on the global political landscape.\\n\",\n",

They also claimed not to collect device IDs, which identify each user and their phone, but this was also found to be untrue. Another significant finding was TikTok\\'s claim that they don\\'t have any user data in China, which was contradicted by their study showing regular connections to Chinese servers.\\n\\nThe reporter questions TikTok\\'s claim of not having a server in mainland China, which Potter confirms as false. The report then shifts to a visual representation of how TikTok gathers private information. A young woman walks in a park while using her phone. A large TikTok logo pin icon appears next to her, indicating location tracking. Graphics show facial and voice biometrics being collected. The report details how TikTok accesses contacts and information from other apps running on the phone.\\n\\nThe scene changes back to Potter, who explains that TikTok collects keystroke patterns, rhythms, body language, face and body features, and clipboard data, which could include photos and passwords stored in the phone\\'s memory. He mentions that the latest version of the app has a \"super location\" field that collects precise location data, including direction, speed, altitude, latitude, and longitude.\\n\\nThe reporter expresses disbelief at the extent of data collection and asks if there\\'s anything TikTok doesn\\'t know. Potter replies negatively. The report then introduces Victor Gao, who suggests the West is being paranoid. He argues that data security is a legitimate concern and government regulators should focus on ensuring privacy and data sensitivity are addressed rather than demonizing TikTok, which he considers an innovative company deserving protection.\\n\\nThe report returns to the reporter, who points out that there are no guarantees that ByteDance or the Chinese government won\\'t access Australian or American personal information. Gao responds that if one follows that logic, no electronic device would be safe because generalized national security concerns can lead to seeing \"devils everywhere.\" He urges the Australian government to treat China as an equal to avoid creating an enemy with 1.4 billion people. He emphasizes the importance of getting along rather than loving each other.\\n\\nThe segment concludes with the reporter summarizing the program and directing viewers to the show\\'s social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. She mentions Nine Now for catching up on missed stories and signs off, promising another edition of 60 Minutes the following week.

       "   'description': '**Category**\\n\\nNews Segment - Discussion on Inflation and its Impact on Renters\\n\\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\\n\\nThe segment begins with an expert discussing the government\\'s role in addressing inflation. He emphasizes the importance of targeted relief for low-income individuals facing high rents and interest rates, suggesting rent assistance as a viable option. He cautions against broad-based relief, arguing that it could exacerbate the situation.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to a woman named Shantel Schmidt, a freelance writer, who recently experienced a significant rent increase of $700 per fortnight.  She is shown using her laptop, presumably managing her finances or seeking information about her rights as a tenant. The visuals shift between close-ups of her face and hands on the laptop, conveying her concern and the practical steps she\\'s taking to address the issue.\\n\\nThe narrator explains that Shantel and her housemates are planning to take their case to the tenancy tribunal. If they are unsuccessful, she might be forced to move out, becoming another victim of out-of-control inflation.\\n\\nThe scene changes to Shantel discussing the situation with a reporter in her kitchen. The reporter asks her about the concept of a \"fair go\" and whether she believes her situation aligns with it. Shantel acknowledges that everyone is feeling the pinch of inflation but expresses her belief that some people are taking advantage of the situation while others are struggling. She calls for greater empathy and fairness in dealing with the challenges posed by inflation.\\n\\nThe segment concludes with the show\\'s host wrapping up the regular program and inviting viewers to engage with the show on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. He also promotes a documentary about cocaine crooks featured earlier in the program, available on 9Now.  Finally, he introduces a special report by Tara Brown about Kathleen Folbigg, a mother accused and convicted of killing her four babies. He highlights new scientific evidence that suggests a potential miscarriage of justice in her case.\\n\\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\\n\\n* 60 Minutes (news program logo)\\n* 9Now (streaming service logo)\\n* Facebook logo\\n* Twitter logo\\n* Instagram logo\\n* TikTok logo\\n\\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\\n\\n* Studio interview with an expert on inflation\\n* Shantel Schmidt\\'s apartment: living room and kitchen\\n* 60 Minutes studio set with the host\\n* Graphic displaying social media handles for 60 Minutes\\n* Graphic promoting the Kathleen Folbigg special report\\n\\n**KeyThemes**\\n\\n* Inflation and its impact on renters\\n* Targeted vs. broad-based relief measures\\n* Rent increases and affordability\\n* Tenant rights and the tenancy tribunal\\n* Fairness and empathy during economic hardship\\n* Potential miscarriage of justice in the Kathleen Folbigg case\\n\\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\\n\\n* Expert on inflation (unnamed)\\n* Shantel Schmidt (freelance writer and renter)\\n* Reporter interviewing Shantel Schmidt (unnamed)\\n* 60 Minutes host (unnamed)\\n* Tara Brown (reporter)\\n* Kathleen Folbigg (subject of special report)',\n",

A woman reaches out to pet one of the horses. The narrator mentions that the family moved to Queensland so their daughter, Ariarne Titmus, could chase her dream of becoming an Olympic swimmer. Her younger sister, Mia, was twelve at the time of the move. Mia recalls telling her friends that she was leaving in four weeks and that she had a big group of friends, so it was hard to leave. Ariarne pets a horse. The narrator says that Ariarne’s father, Steve, said that if Ariarne wanted to chase her dream of being an Olympic swimmer, it wasn’t a matter of sitting around in Tasmania and waiting for what might come in the future. They had to make a decision quickly. Ariarne pets a white horse. The narrator says that the family packed up their lives and moved to Queensland, the state that produces more Olympic swimmers than anywhere else in Australia. Ariarne and Mia pet a horse together. The narrator says that the reality hit the family. The mother, Robyn, says that it was all good to say it, but then they had to think about work opportunities. She looks back and thinks that they took a chance. The title card for the segment, “Will to Win,” appears on screen.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a kitchen. Mia and Ariarne are making breakfast. Their father, Steve, walks in. Mia asks Ariarne if she bought the cereal for herself. Ariarne says that she did. The narrator says that it’s breakfast time in the Titmus family home in Brisbane, and sisters Ariarne and Mia are in the middle of a battle over food. Mia asks Steve if he finished off her milk. Steve says that he only used a little bit. The narrator says that eight years ago, after moving from Tasmania, it’s here in Queensland where the real fight began for Ariarne.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a swimming pool. Ariarne is in the pool with her coach, Dean Boxall. The narrator says that Ariarne began training with her new coach, Dean Boxall, a man now known worldwide as excitable and unpredictable. A clip of Dean Boxall celebrating Ariarne’s win at the Olympics plays. The narrator says that when Dean Boxall took Ariarne on, he knew there was a lot of work ahead. At fifty-four kilograms, Ariarne didn’t look like a swimmer and had never been to the gym. The narrator says that out-of-pool training became just as important, with Ariarne turning into a gym junkie, building muscle and strength, transforming her body. Ariarne is shown doing pull-ups and push-ups in the gym. Her father, Steve, is shown pushing a sled in the gym. Ariarne pulls a sled attached to Steve’s waist. The narrator says that Ariarne knew only a warrior could beat five-time Olympic legend, American Katie Ledecky, widely regarded as the greatest female swimmer of all time. Ariarne is shown swimming. The narrator says that back then, it was an impossible dream, because in the four-hundred-meter freestyle, Ariarne was a massive sixteen seconds slower. A clip of Katie Ledecky swimming plays.

An interviewer asks Dean Boxall if he had any idea that the fourteen-year-old he saw in 2015 was training by herself in a public pool in Launceston. Dean Boxall says that he didn’t know of that at the time, but it’s become like an urban legend. They heard stories of the Tasmanian girl because she beat one of his swimmers to make the junior team. He was watching closely down there. He watched and he saw. The interviewer says that he saw something in her. Dean Boxall says that she wasn’t the most talented. She was so far behind in turns, skills, and dives, but she was a dog. She wouldn’t let go. She could take critique. Not other people can take critique.

       "   'description': 'Sure! Here is a detailed description of the video from 600 seconds to 1200 seconds, organized by category:\\n\\n**Category**\\n\\nNews\\n\\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\\n\\nThe video opens with a view of the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge, described as one of the most picturesque locations in the world. The scene then shifts to a boat on the water, with the sun shining brightly in the background. The camera focuses on the hands of a person steering the boat. The scene then transitions to a man in a uniform, identified as Superintendent Graeme Campbell of the Australian Border Force. He is standing on the boat and looking out at the water. The camera zooms in on the Australian Border Force logo on the side of the boat. The Australian flag is shown waving in the wind.\\n\\nThe scene then shifts to an interview between Superintendent Campbell and a reporter. The reporter asks Campbell about the threat posed by the cruise ship industry in Australia. Campbell responds that it is a very real threat for the importation of narcotics. He clarifies that the majority of passengers and crew are legitimate travelers, but that a very small element is trying to use the industry to import narcotics. The reporter points out that Australia is a big island and a big target, and Campbell agrees, adding that it is an attractive target for organized crime. The reporter asks if it is hard to police, and Campbell says it is very hard, but that they are pretty good at it.\\n\\nThe scene then shifts to a cruise ship at sea. The narrator explains that in August 2016, Campbell and his colleagues were tracking the Sea Princess as it made its way around the world. Their targets were Isabelle Lagace and Melina Roberge. The narrator explains that the two women had been identified as passengers of interest, and that one of the destinations on their itinerary was a major concern. Campbell explains that certain ports in South America are associated with the production and distribution of cocaine, and that the Sea Princess visited some of those ports. He says that this escalated the risk, because it gave the passengers access to organized crime entities who are based in high-risk countries. The reporter asks at what point along the journey they had eyes directly on the passengers, and Campbell says that they were monitoring their movements along the way.\\n\\nThe scene then shifts to a series of photos of Lagace and Roberge, showing them enjoying their vacation. The narrator explains that the plan was to bring cocaine from Peru to Sydney on the cruise ship. Lagace is interviewed and says that she wasn\\'t really thinking about the consequences. The scene then shifts to photos of other passengers on the cruise, including Barry and Nerida Rowe. The narrator explains that Barry and Nerida were making the most of their port days, taking in the sights wherever they could, but that they didn\\'t see much of Isabelle or Melina in Peru. The narrator explains that the women were certainly up to something, and that this was the most crucial part of their mission: the cocaine pickup.\\n\\nThe scene then shifts to a person unpacking a suitcase full of cocaine. The narrator explains that a mystery man collected the drugs, loaded them into a suitcase, smuggled it on board the Sea Princess, and later, after getting the key from Isabelle, placed it under the bed in their cabin. The narrator explains that this seems like an extraordinary lapse of security, but that Barry and Nerida weren\\'t exactly surprised. Barry says that he can\\'t fathom how anyone can think that they could smuggle something on board a vessel. Nerida says that they had no idea that there was other stuff getting loaded on. Lagace is interviewed and says that she was aware that Peru was the destination for the drugs, but that they weren\\'t going to be in their cabin yet, so they just continued the trip and enjoyed the streets of Peru. She says that she had way too much to drink and was completely drunk. She remembers doing a lot of Snapchat stories, laughing, and living her best life. The narrator explains that the plan couldn\\'t have been more straightforward: while the party girls partied, a mystery man collected the drugs, loaded them into a suitcase, smuggled it on board the Sea Princess, and later, after getting the key from Isabelle, placed it under the bed in their cabin. The narrator explains that it seems like an extraordinary lapse of security, but that Barry and Nerida weren\\'t exactly surprised.\\n\\nThe scene then shifts to Barry and Nerida walking on a dock. The narrator explains that they weren\\'t exactly surprised, but that this was the most crucial part of their mission: the cocaine pickup. The scene then shifts to a montage of photos of Lagace and Roberge on their vacation. The narrator explains that they were intent on making the most of the rest of their free holiday. Lagace is interviewed and says that it was beginning to be a bit stressful after Peru, but that she was just trying to enjoy the cruise as much as she could. The scene then shifts to a montage of photos of Lagace and Roberge on their vacation. The narrator explains that as the Sea Princess sailed closer to Australia, the operation to close in intensified, and the Australian Border Force was ready and waiting for Lagace and Roberge.\\n\\nThe scene then shifts to the Sea Princess arriving in Sydney. The narrator explains that no one on board could have imagined what was about to unfold. The scene then shifts to passengers disembarking the ship. The narrator explains that for most, it was the end of a nearly two-month stint at sea, the holiday of a lifetime. But for Lagace and Roberge, it was the final stop on a mission to import cocaine into Australia. The scene then shifts to a police car driving through a port. The Australian Border Force logo is shown. Superintendent Campbell is interviewed and says that they were looking to break laws, they were looking to do bad things. The scene then shifts to a person unpacking a suitcase full of cocaine. The narrator explains that the Sea Princess now had new cargo: more than $20 million of cocaine.\\n\\nThe scene then shifts to Lagace and Roberge partying on the cruise ship. The narrator explains that leaving Peru, you\\'d think the stakes would be a little bit higher for them, but rather than keep a low profile, they were intent on making the most of the rest of their free holiday. Lagace is interviewed and says that it was beginning to be a bit stressful after Peru, but that she was just trying to enjoy the cruise as much as she could. She says that she got a tattoo in Tahiti, and that the artist was amazing. She says that\\'s the only thing she doesn\\'t regret about the trip.\\n\\nThe scene then shifts to the Sea Princess arriving in Sydney. The narrator explains that as the Sea Princess sailed closer to Australia, the operation to close in intensified, and the Australian Border Force was ready and waiting for Lagace and Roberge.

The narrator explains that no one on board could have imagined what was about to unfold. The scene then shifts to Barry and Nerida sitting on a bench. Nerida says that they were sitting in the cafe, and she looked up and thought, \"Oh, there\\'s a dog.\" And then she looked, and then there was a heavily uniformed man attached to that dog. There was a few of them, and she went, \"Look, look.\" Oh, maybe this is normal at the end of a cruise. Then she watched them walk past and go down the corridor. Then they had friends who were in that same corridor as the girls. She came up going, \"Oh my God, they\\'ve got the girls on the floor. There\\'s police and dogs.\" The reporter asks Barry what was going on in his head when he saw that, and Barry says that it answered a lot of questions.\\n\\nThe scene then shifts to Lagace being interviewed. She says that they asked them to follow them to the cabin, and then there were people with dogs. The dogs sat next to the luggage. They asked if it was her bed, she said yes, and they asked if it was her luggage, and she said yes. She didn\\'t know the combination, so they just cut it open to find out about 30 kilograms of cocaine in her luggage. Superintendent Campbell is interviewed and says that it was obvious that they weren\\'t really hidden. The reporter asks what the reaction from the girls was at the time. Campbell says that they were both very surprised.\\n\\nThe scene then shifts to Lagace being interviewed. She says that Sydney morning, people were starting to disembark the ship. She went upstairs at the buffet to eat her breakfast, and that\\'s when the border force entered the restaurant, and she knew it was over. They were almost the only ones in the restaurant as well, so of course, she knew it was for her. The narrator explains that Isabelle\\'s career as a cocaine courier was finished, just seven weeks after it had started. And while she and Melina had always known there was a possibility of being busted, the other passengers, like Barry and Nerida, were stunned by the presence of border force. Nerida says that they were sitting in the cafe, and she looked up and thought, \"Oh, there\\'s a dog.\" And then she looked, and then there was a heavily uniformed man attached to that dog. There was a few of them, and she went, \"Look, look.\" Oh, maybe this is normal at the end of a cruise. Then she watched them walk past and go down the corridor.

The scene transitions to various Vivid Sydney displays, including a projected image of a bird, green laser lights, and a child interacting with a large, colorful digital screen. The reporter mentions that while most of Vivid Sydney is free, a new exhibit at the Royal Botanic Garden will cost $128 for a family of four. A man in a suit and tie is then shown speaking, attributing the decision to charge for the exhibit to the former government. The scene shifts to the Sydney Opera House, first in daylight and then illuminated with colorful projections. The man in the suit reiterates his satisfaction with the decision. The reporter concludes her segment, and the scene cuts back to the news studio.\\n\\nA male news anchor introduces the weather segment, and a female meteorologist presents the Sydney weather forecast. She describes a beautiful autumn day with blue skies and sunshine, but mentions a freezing morning with temperatures below zero in some areas.

CCTV footage shows them breaking into a Desi Mart in Westmead, stealing money and causing thousands of dollars in damage. The owner of the Desi Mart expresses his devastation, mentioning the financial struggles his small business is facing. Police say the trio is also responsible for a home invasion in Longueville, where they stole an Audi. The stolen vehicle was later found abandoned in Annandale. A reporter on the scene reports that a 16-year-old boy has been arrested and charged in connection with the crimes. The hunt continues for the other two offenders.\\n\\nThe news then shifts to a report on dangerous school zones in Sydney. The most dangerous intersection is identified as Chalmers Street, Redfern, near Sydney High School, where 99 drivers have run a red light in the past 10 months. Other dangerous zones include Borella Road, Albury; Meredith Street, Bankstown; and Cox's Road, North Ryde. The Roads Minister expresses concern over these figures and emphasizes the importance of slowing down in school zones. Statistics reveal that there were over 15,000 speeding and red light offenses in school zones across the state over a 10-month period, averaging 52 per day.\\n\\nThe next story covers climate activists disrupting Shell's annual shareholder meeting.

       "   'description': \"Sure, here's a detailed description of the video from 600 seconds to 1200 seconds, organized by category:\\n\\n**Category**\\n\\nNews\\n\\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\\n\\nThe video starts with a news segment about the Sydney train network. The reporter mentions that the train network is neither reliable nor resilient. An independent report attempts to explain why. The transport minister, Jo Haylen, states that the train network has been fragile since the introduction of the 2017 timetable. The report acknowledges a sudden and significant increase in the backlog when unions went to war last year, coupled with a series of freak floods. The main recommendation is for a 12-month maintenance blitz to bring the network up to scratch, but the transport minister says no more money will be allocated to repairs and no services will be cut to allow extra time on the tracks. The shadow transport minister, Natalie Ward, criticizes the government for hiding behind a six-year-old timetable change and not having a plan. The timetable is due for review next year when the opening of the new metro line through the city is expected to relieve pressure.\\n\\nThe next news segment is about two would-be thieves who led police on a short but destructive chase through Bradbury in Sydney's southwest. They jumped fences and fell through the roof of a shed. One tried to hide, another escaped, and tonight remains on the run. The police are after the suspect, who is hard to see in the dark. The suspect bolts into the darkness at the end of Cable Road in Bradbury. He vanishes. The police ask a resident if he saw the suspect come up this way. The resident says he doesn't know where he went. The police tell someone to get back in their car. The second suspect didn't run, he hid. After a few minutes of searching, he's eventually arrested. The chase started only ten minutes earlier when the two men allegedly tried to break into a home on nearby Callie Road around 10 last night. The woman inside dialed triple zero as the men tried to find a way in. When police arrived, they were spooked, running out the back, past a pool, and jumping onto the roof of a shed. The roof gave way. They kicked the door off and headed for the street. As police were chasing one suspect, a second was able to slip into the backyard of a property. It took several minutes until a resident spotted the intruder and called out to police. Brian McCreadie, a witness, said his son asked the suspect what he was doing there, and the suspect said he was chasing someone who broke into his house. Brian didn't buy it, pointing him out to police. Cameras captured the moment they swarmed the 31-year-old, arresting and charging him with three offenses relating to the alleged attempted break-in. His mate is still on the run.\\n\\nThe next news segment is about the Lehmann Inquiry. A senior police officer who investigated the Brittany Higgins rape allegations says he did not believe the evidence against Bruce Lehrmann was sufficient enough to take him to trial. Detective Inspector Scott Moller said police investigators were under significant pressure from the media to charge Mr. Lehrmann. Mr. Lehrmann has consistently denied the allegation of rape.\\n\\nThe next news segment is about the Voice to Parliament. There has been a fiery start to debate over a Voice to Parliament. Opposition leader Peter Dutton called it the most radical change to our democracy in history. The Prime Minister is back from a successful summit in Japan, now facing a domestic battle over the referendum. Fresh from a diplomatic dash abroad into a fight on the home front, Peter Dutton today wrapped up his attack. He said a voice would be the most radical and consequential change to the way our democracy operates in our nation's history. Labeling the referendum a reckless roll of the dice, he said the government wants people to vote for the voice on a vibe. Linda Burney, the Indigenous Affairs Minister, said they had just heard in one speech every bit of disinformation and misinformation and scare campaigns. A new ad campaign is rolling out from the Yes side. The ad says the voice will be a permanent body and it would give independent advice. As Parliament considers legislation for the words that would be added to our Constitution, Eliza Edwards, a federal politics reporter, said that while the bill enabling the referendum is contentious, it's expected to pass Parliament in coming weeks before the Prime Minister fires the starting gun on the official campaign, setting the date Australians will head to the polls. Zali Steggall, an independent MP, said we are at a really important start line as a nation of what we can be. The purpose of the voice is to improve outcomes for our people. Dorinda Cox, a Greens MP, said they want to make sure that they are standing on the right side of history.\\n\\nThe next news segment is about a semi-trailer mishap. A semi-trailer hauling an excavator fell onto its side at Homebush West this morning, blocking Caroly Avenue. There were traffic delays with a small fuel spill cleaned up by fire and rescue. The driver was shaken but not hurt.\\n\\nThe next news segment is about India PM visit. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is arriving in Sydney tonight for a much-anticipated visit. Nine's Eddy Meyer joins from Sydney Airport. He says there is lots of color and movement. Narendra Modi will arrive at the private jet base in a couple of hours. His first scheduled appearance is not until tomorrow night, an event at Sydney Olympic Park where he'll be greeted by 20,000 adoring Indian Australians. The event was oversubscribed, with people flying in from all over the country and New Zealand. He'll be greeted there by the Prime Minister, who will then hold formal talks with Mr. Modi on Wednesday morning. No one will be more excited about this visit than the residents of Sydney's own Little India at Harris Park, desperately hoping that Mr. Modi comes to visit them.\\n\\nThe next news segment is about Sydney weather. Amber Sherlock, the weather reporter, says winter has arrived early. Despite the winds dying down today, it was still bitterly cold under clear blue skies. Camden and Richmond dipped to zero degrees. Campbelltown, Horsley Park, and Penrith fell to a nice three degrees. Bankstown was four degrees. The city fell to eight this morning, four degrees colder than average, before reaching a top of 20 this afternoon, although it felt closer to 17 degrees thanks to those southwesterly winds. It took several hours for the west to warm up, finally reaching 21 degrees, but only briefly. It will be another chilly night tonight.\\n\\nThe next news segment is about a credit crackdown. Big changes to buy now, pay later. The crackdown that will change the way people shop online. It's been growing out of control. Perth mom Krystal Brown now has to use Afterpay for essentials like nappies. She says she's bankrupt, but it's one of the few lines of credit still open to her. She says she doesn't like to be dependent on many things, if anything, but Afterpay is definitely something that they can't live without at the moment. The government is worried. Buy now, pay later was never meant to be relied on like this, and the laws are too weak to keep out predators. The Albanese government is announcing that they intend to bring buy now, pay later into the National Consumer Credit Act. It will mean mandatory credit licenses for all providers, responsible lending rules, dispute resolution, and hardship options for people struggling to pay.\\n\\n\\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\\n\\n* Nine News\\n* 2GB\\n* Transport Sydney Trains\\n* Hope 103.2\\n* Afterpay\\n* Zip\\n* humm\\n* Klarna\\n* penpay\\n* PayPal\\n* sezzle\\n* SplitIt\\n* zippay\\n\\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\\n\\n* Sydney train station\\n* Press conference room with flags\\n* Train station platform\\n* Train interior\\n* Train replacement bus stop\\n* Train tracks\\n* News studio\\n* Residential street at night\\n* House with damaged shed\\n* Street interview\\n* Parliament House\\n* Homebush West\\n* Sydney Airport\\n* Retail store\\n\\n**KeyThemes**\\n\\n* Sydney train network reliability and resilience issues\\n* Police chase and arrest of would-be thieves\\n* Lehmann Inquiry and allegations of rape\\n* Voice to Parliament referendum debate\\n* Semi-trailer mishap causing traffic disruptions\\n* Sydney weather report\\n* Credit crackdown on buy now, pay later services\\n* New food scrap bins in Sydney's Inner West\\n\\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\\n\\n* Jo Haylen (Transport Minister)\\n* Carolyn Walsh (National Transport Commission Chair)\\n* Liz Daniels (State Politics Reporter)\\n* Natalie Ward (Shadow Transport Minister)\\n* Alex Heinke (Reporter)\\n* Bruce Lehrmann\\n* Peter Dutton (Opposition Leader)\\n* Linda Burney (Indigenous Affairs Minister)\\n* Eliza Edwards (Federal Politics Reporter)\\n* Zali Steggall (Independent MP)\\n* Dorinda Cox (Greens MP)\\n* Narendra Modi (India's Prime Minister)\\n* Eddy Meyer (Reporter)\\n* Amber Sherlock (Weather Reporter)\\n* Krystal Brown (Afterpay User)\\n* Stephen Jones (Financial Services Minister)\",\n",

       "   'description': '**Category**\\n\\nNews\\n\\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\\n\\nThe video begins with a segment on indoor plants and their ability to remove toxins from the air. The scene shows several plants enclosed in clear containers in a laboratory setting. The news anchor mentions that Sydney\\'s University of Technology has discovered how plants remove toxic petrol fumes from indoor air. This is described as a \"handy revelation for city dwellers,\" as petrol fumes are linked to an increased risk of cancer and asthma.\\n\\nThe next segment focuses on a breakthrough treatment for paralysis using artificial intelligence. The anchor introduces a story about Swiss neuroscientists who have enabled a paralyzed man to walk again. The man, Gert-Jan Oskam, is shown walking with the assistance of a walker and wearing a device on his head. The technology involves a \"digital bridge\" that re-establishes communication between the brain and the spinal cord. This is achieved through electronic implants, one in the brain and another over the spinal cord. The patient has to learn how to work with his brain signals and how to correlate these signals to the spinal cord stimulation. Gert-Jan Oskam, the patient, shares his experience, expressing his joy at being able to stand and have a beer with his friends after ten years. The technology is described as \"transforming thought into action.\" The researchers hope to extend this technology to restore arm and hand functions as well.\\n\\nThe news then shifts to a preview of Vivid Sydney, the largest drone show in the Southern Hemisphere. Secret rehearsals for the show, \"Written in the Stars,\" have taken place at Eastern Creek. The show is part of the Vivid Festival. John Graham, Minister for Jobs and Tourism, expresses his excitement about the event, emphasizing its scale and uniqueness. The news anchor encourages viewers to use public transport to get to the city for the festival.\\n\\nFinally, the news transitions to the weather segment. The weather presenter, Amber, gives a brief overview of the current temperature in Sydney, which is 17 degrees in the city and 12 degrees in the west. She then provides a more detailed weather report for Sydney and New South Wales. Today\\'s weather in Sydney was cold and sunny, with warmer temperatures in the water than on land. A rare sighting of a blue whale off the coast of Terrigal was also reported. The temperatures in various Sydney suburbs reached a high of 18 to 21 degrees. The rest of New South Wales experienced a dry and cool day with sunny skies in the northeast and partly cloudy skies in the west and south. The forecast for tomorrow includes a cold front reaching the New South Wales coast with strong wind gusts exceeding 80 kilometers per hour, bringing showers.

To her left is a poster featuring a shirtless man with tape over his mouth and the words \"FRAGILE\" across his chest. The poster also includes the title \"WHO\\'S HUGH?\" and credits Serge Negus as the producer.\\n\\nThe woman introduces the story, mentioning Hugh Sheridan, an actor who dared to \"act.\" She explains that Hugh accepted a role that many actors are paid to do, but in doing so, offended a minority group. This group then made it their mission to \"brutally cancel\" him.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to a darkened theater. The lights gradually come up, revealing a man standing on stage. The camera zooms in, and the man is identified as Hugh Sheridan. He appears to be starting a performance.\\n\\nThe segment then cuts to a montage of Hugh\\'s career highlights. It includes clips of him in various roles, both on stage and screen. He\\'s shown in a music video, a television show, and accepting an award.

The narrator explains that the play is a gay love story set in the Cold War era. Hugh was supposed to play Hedwig, a character who is forced to have a sex change.\\n\\nThe segment then discusses the backlash Hugh received for taking the role.

Fleming\\'s rampage was described as terrifying, but not the work of a terrorist. The Supreme Court ruled that these were the actions of a man who belonged in a hospital rather than prison. Fleming\\'s rampage involved dressing in combat black, arming himself with a rifle, gel blaster, and a fake bomb, and taking two men hostage inside a Windang dive shop. A USB containing plans for a similar outburst was discovered after Fleming surrendered. He warned that the planned outburst would \"make the Cronulla riots look like a kindergarten field trip.\" Fleming pleaded not guilty, arguing that he had no understanding of what he had done because he suffered from schizophrenia. Four weeks into the trial, the Crown case collapsed after the evidence of a right-wing extremist expert was thrown out. The judge ordered the jury to clear Fleming of the terrorism charge. Eleven other firearm and kidnap offenses will be dealt with on mental health grounds. Fleming\\'s solicitor, Aaron Kernaghan, stated that Fleming felt like he had been heard for the first time. Fleming\\'s family will now take action against the DPP to cover their legal bill.\\n\\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about a car and motorcycle crash on Warringah Road at Forestville. The crash caused chaos during the morning peak, forcing two of three westbound lanes to shut. No one was seriously injured.\\n\\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about the fallout from the tasering of a 95-year-old great-grandmother, Clare Nowland, inside her Cooma nursing home. The police officer who tasered her has been suspended from the force with full pay. Nowland\\'s family remains by her side in the hospital. A worker at Yallambee Lodge, where Nowland resided, has received death threats. Senior Constable Christian White, a local officer with 12 years of experience, is at the center of one of the force\\'s biggest internal probes. Police initially held back crucial details, then stated that Nowland was approaching police with a knife. Nowland\\'s family released a statement expressing their profound love and affection for her and thanking Cooma and the world for the outpouring of support for her and her ongoing battle with dementia.\\n\\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about Premier Chris Minns being accused of \"class warfare\" over his stamp duty reforms for first home buyers. Buyers entering the market will pay no stamp duty on homes up to $800,000 under legislation put before state parliament. The legislation will also scrap a scheme that offers a choice of paying an upfront lump sum or a lower annual fee on homes up to $1.5 million.\\n\\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about Qantas announcing a record underlying profit of close to $2.5 billion for this financial year. This would be almost a billion dollars higher than its previous record in 2018. The Transport Workers\\' Union is unimpressed, calling on the airline to pay back the $2.7 billion in taxpayer support it received during the pandemic. Michael Kaine, from the Transport Workers\\' Union, criticizes Qantas for the illegal sacking of 1,700 workers and for airfares and service standards being \"through the roof.\"\\n\\nThe news segment then transitions to a report about Australian athletes preparing for the Paris Olympics. The athletes road-tested the uniforms they hope will propel them to gold medal glory. They will be guided by cycling legend Anna Meares, who will be Australia\\'s Chef de Mission in Paris. The Nine Network has announced that it has added the Paralympics to its Olympics broadcast, with exclusive coverage across its media platforms.\\n\\nThe news segment then transitions to a weather report for Sydney. It has been a beautiful blue sky day with light southeasterly winds, but the morning was freezing. Camden and Richmond dipped to 0 degrees, Horsley Park, Campbelltown, and Canterbury fell to 2 degrees, and Bankstown fell to 3 degrees. The city fell to just under 8 degrees before warming up to nearly 20 degrees in the afternoon sunshine. Penrith dipped to just below 3 degrees.

The lighting is dim, creating an intimate atmosphere. The camera focuses on a woman with long, dark hair, wearing a sparkly blue dress. She is speaking animatedly, her hands gesturing as she talks. A man next to her, wearing a light-colored jacket, listens attentively, nodding occasionally.\\n\\nThe camera then shifts to a different group, seated on a green couch. A man with short, dark hair and a beard is talking to a woman with long, blonde hair and bright pink eyeshadow. The woman holds a wine glass in her hand.

Like, is that his vibe?\"\\n\\nThe scene cuts back to the dinner table, where the woman in the blue dress continues her conversation with the man in the light jacket. They are both smiling and laughing.\\n\\nThe camera then focuses on a man in a beige shirt and jeans, who is standing at the table, addressing the group. He seems to be trying to calm the situation, suggesting that they \"drop it\" and let the issue resolve itself.\\n\\nThe scene shifts to a different angle, showing the group on the couch. A man in a beige shirt is standing in front of them, talking to them. He appears to be mediating the conversation. The group on the couch listens intently, their facial expressions showing concern and curiosity.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a group of three people sitting at a table in a different room.

       "   'description': 'Here\\'s a detailed description of the video following your requested format:\\n\\n**Category**\\nNews\\n\\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\\n\\nThe video opens with a close-up shot of a stopwatch ticking, with the words \"60 MINUTES\" displayed in red and white on a black background. The scene then transitions to a man in a suit, Tom Steinfort, standing in front of Buckingham Palace in London. He introduces the program, \"60 Minutes,\" and welcomes viewers to London. He mentions that it\\'s unusual for a 74-year-old to take on a new job, but that\\'s the case for King Charles III. He notes that the new monarch has been officially crowned and now faces the challenge of filling his mother\\'s shoes.\\n\\nSteinfort points out that polling indicates Queen Elizabeth was more popular than Charles, as are his son William, his sister Anne, and even his grandchildren. He adds that the new king needs to win people over not just in the UK but also in other countries like Australia, where the idea of a republic is being discussed again.\\n\\nThe video then shows footage of King Charles III and Queen Camilla on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, waving to the crowd. The narrator describes it as a moment in history. The scene shifts to a child sitting on someone\\'s shoulders, taking a picture of the royal couple with a smartphone. The narrator mentions that the moment will stay with the attendees for the rest of their lives.\\n\\nThe video then shows King Charles and Queen Camilla on the balcony with other members of the royal family. The narrator describes the opulent crowns, heavy with precious gemstones and the weight of expectation. The narrator mentions that the traditional flyover had to be scaled back due to weather conditions. Prince Louis\\'s waving is likened to windscreen wipers.\\n\\nThe video cuts to an interview with Valentine Low, the royal correspondent for The Times newspaper. Low talks about the huge outpouring of love for Charles and expresses his belief that Charles will be a better king than people expect. He then describes being inside Westminster Abbey during the coronation, witnessing every remarkable moment up close. He mentions the basis of the coronation ceremony goes back over a thousand years and that he felt like he was part of history. He praises the music and the splendor of the king\\'s robes.\\n\\nThe video returns to footage of the coronation ceremony inside Westminster Abbey. The narrator describes the service as steeped in tradition but also with a nod to the changing face of modern Britain. A gospel choir is shown performing.\\n\\nThe video then shows the arrival of the Prince and Princess of Wales with their three children. Young George is described as watching his own future play out before him. Kate and Charlotte are described as radiant in matching Alexander McQueen gowns.\\n\\nThe video shows Prince William pledging allegiance to his father, King Charles, and sealing it with a kiss. Low comments on the genuine fondness between the two.\\n\\nThe video then shows footage of Queen Elizabeth II\\'s coronation in 1953, highlighting how young she was at the time, 25 years old. Her son, Charles, was only four years old. The narrator contrasts this with Charles\\'s coronation at age 74, the oldest sovereign to ever take the throne.\\n\\nThe video returns to Prince Louis, whose yawns and waves caused a sensation. It then shows Prince Harry arriving alone at his father\\'s coronation, without his wife Meghan and their children, who stayed home in America. Harry is shown sitting in the third row, his view sometimes obstructed. Low comments on Harry\\'s decision to leave the service quickly and fly home, highlighting the fractured relationship between Harry, his father, and his brother. He also mentions Meghan\\'s absence and expresses regret that she didn\\'t attend.\\n\\nThe video then introduces Madeleine Easton, the only Australian asked to perform at the coronation. She expresses her disbelief at being part of such a historic event. The video shows her playing the violin. The narrator mentions that Madeleine is a member of the Baroque Soloists and Monteverdi Choir, of which King Charles is not just the patron but also a huge fan.\\n\\nThe video concludes with Low commenting on Prince Andrew\\'s exclusion from the balcony display and his relegation to the third row. He speculates on Andrew\\'s thoughts during the ceremony, suggesting Andrew might be in denial about his situation. The video shows Andrew leaving the Abbey and getting into a car.\\n\\n**BrandsCompanyNamesLogos**\\n60 Minutes, BMW\\n\\n**KeyLocationsAndScenes**\\nBuckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, London streets\\n\\n**KeyThemes**\\nKing Charles III\\'s coronation, the changing face of the monarchy, family dynamics within the royal family, the historical significance of the coronation, the role of tradition and modernity in the ceremony.\\n\\n**PeopleAppearingAndMentioned**\\nKing Charles III, Queen Camilla, Tom Steinfort, Prince William, Princess Kate, Prince Louis, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Princess Anne, Valentine Low, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Prince Andrew, Madeleine Easton, Jeffrey Epstein, Queen Elizabeth II.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': 'Here is a detailed description of the video you provided:\\n\\n**Category**\\nNews\\n\\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\\nThe video opens with a dashcam video of a Porsche speeding on a freeway. The narrator says, \"A speeding Porsche, a drugged truck driver.\" The scene shifts to a traffic camera view of a semi-truck driving on the freeway.

A group of people in formal attire are singing and raising their hands on a stage. The accident scene is shown again.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a man with graying hair receiving a head massage from a person with darker skin.

A man in a leopard print robe stands in a room, holding a picture frame. The words \"HUGH SHERIDAN\" appear on the screen.

Hugh Sheridan is seen from behind, walking towards a bridge. He speaks in an interview, saying, \"I was in total shock.\" He is seen on a stage, with Twitter logos and the text \"Being trans isn\\'t a costume\" appearing on the screen.

Several news reporters introduce themselves. A woman with blonde hair sits on a stool in front of a screen displaying photos of the deceased officers. She welcomes viewers to the program and introduces the story of the freeway accident that killed four police officers three years ago. She mentions the Porsche driver who filmed the dying officers and shared the video with friends. She introduces the segment, \"UNDER THE INFLUENCE,\" and reveals a bizarre twist: the truck driver might not have been behind the wheel that day if not for his boss\\'s devotion to a religious sect called The Potter\\'s House.\\n\\nThe man with the long white beard speaks in an interview, recalling his last words to his wife, Lynnette, one of the deceased officers.

The narrator mentions that Singh\\'s colleagues were worried about his state of mind and exhaustion. A text message from a coworker to Simon Tuteru expresses concern about Singh\\'s mental state and unfitness to drive. The man with the long white beard speaks in an interview, expressing his disbelief at Tuteru\\'s actions. Tuteru is shown walking out of a building and getting into his car. The narrator reveals that Singh told police that Tuteru talked about witchcraft and voodoo dolls. Singh is shown being escorted. Photos of Lynnette Taylor with her husband are displayed. The man with the long white beard speaks again, expressing his anger at Tuteru\\'s disregard for the warnings. Tuteru is shown walking out of a building with a plastic bag.

       "   'description': 'The video segment from 40:00 to 45:17 discusses TikTok\\'s data collection practices and the concerns surrounding its potential access by the Chinese government.\\n\\nRobert Potter, the boss of Australian cybersecurity and intelligence firm Internet 2.0, reveals that TikTok collects more data than other social media apps, except for those built in Russia. He explains that Internet 2.0 cracked the source code of TikTok and found that the app heavily collects location data, device ID, and connects to Chinese servers, contradicting TikTok\\'s claims.\\n\\nThe narrator states that TikTok collects a trove of private information, including location, biometrics of the face, voice characteristics, contacts, and information on other running apps. It can also access keystroke patterns, rhythms, body language, face and body features, and the clipboard, which could contain photos, passwords, and other sensitive information stored in the phone\\'s memory. The latest version of the app has a \"super location\" field that collects direction, speed, altitude, latitude, and longitude.\\n\\nVictor Gao, a spokesperson for TikTok, downplays the concerns, suggesting that the West is being paranoid. He argues that data security is a legitimate concern and that government regulators should address it with foolproof arrangements rather than demonizing TikTok. He defends TikTok as an innovative company that deserves protection.\\n\\nLee Hunter, TikTok\\'s boss in Australia, agrees with Gao, insisting that the backlash is driven by politics, not facts. He emphasizes TikTok\\'s commitment to user data safety, security, and privacy. However, when asked what would happen if the CCP or Chinese government requested user data, he states that TikTok wouldn\\'t give it to them. The interviewer counters that they would likely take it without asking. Hunter acknowledges the need for caution in working with China but reiterates that TikTok is an entertainment platform, not a political entity, focused on providing interesting videos.\\n\\nThe segment shifts to a US congressional hearing where lawmakers discuss banning TikTok unless ByteDance sells it off. A congresswoman holds up a sign quoting a leaked internal TikTok memo instructing company spokespersons to downplay the parent company ByteDance, the China association, and AI.\\n\\nGao reiterates his view that banning TikTok is not a sign of strength but rather the opposite. He urges the Australian government to treat China as an equal to avoid creating an enemy with 1.4 billion people. He emphasizes the importance of getting along rather than loving each other.\\n\\nThe program concludes with the host, Amelia Adams, inviting viewers to share their opinions on the show through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. She directs viewers to 9Now to catch up on missed stories and announces their return next week.\\n\\nThroughout the segment, the TikTok logo is prominently displayed, along with the 60 Minutes logo and branding. The segment features interviews, computer code graphics, and footage of a woman using TikTok in a park, as well as scenes from a US congressional hearing. The segment raises concerns about data privacy and the potential influence of the Chinese government on TikTok\\'s operations.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
