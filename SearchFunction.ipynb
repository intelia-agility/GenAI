       "   'headline': 'Curtis Sittenfeld’s celebrity romcom didn’t sweep me off my feet',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>Curtis Sittenfeld likes to pose questions with her novels. What if Hillary had refused to marry Bill? (<em>Rodham.</em>) What if <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> was set in contemporary times? (<em>Eligible.</em>) Why did Democrat-raised librarian Laura Bush marry boisterous Republican George W? (<em>American Wife</em>.)</p> <p>There’s an entertainment tradition of ordinary looking talented men pairing with spectacularly beautiful women. But it would never happen if the genders were reversed – would it? That’s the premise of Sittenfeld’s sixth novel.</p> <p>Sally Milner is a writer for <em>TNO</em>, a fictional <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. When her colleague Danny becomes engaged to a gorgeous celebrity, Sally writes a mocking sketch – The Danny Horst Rule – embodying the novel’s premise. That week, as she helps “cheesily handsome” pop-star guest host Noah write his own sketch, she feels an attraction spark. But it can’t be mutual – can it?</p> <p>The narrative tension, as with any romantic comedy, lies not in whether an attraction exists, or even if it will be consummated, so much as how that will happen, and the specifics of the obstacles they’ll overcome. An awareness of these genre mechanics is written into the novel.</p> <p>Sally’s ambition is “to write non-condescending, ragingly feminist screenplays for romantic comedies”. She tells Noah, “When one of these movies doesn’t work, it’s usually because it’s horribly written and/or because the script hasn’t done the work of convincing you the couple is attracted to each other, so then you don’t care if obstacles get in their way and keep them apart.”</p> <p>Sittenfeld creates a convincing connection between Sally and Noah: they describe their creative work – her comedy and his music – as the loves of their lives. So it makes sense that work is how their true selves are revealed and connect.</p> <p>The conflict between our public and private selves has been central to Sittenfeld’s work since her debut, <em>Prep</em>, whose hyperaware, awkward teen protagonist embodied it. Sally suspects much of her writing emerges from that tension. And she tells Noah, “Sometimes I feel like I’m writing dialogue for the character of myself. I’m impersonating a normal human being when really I’m a confused freak.”</p> <p>This aspect of Sally feels palpably real and suits a comedy writer: humour as armour; a protective layer to shield the real, vulnerable self. And theories such as the Danny Horst Rule feel like believable ways of protecting against romantic rejection.</p> <p>Sally hasn’t allowed herself to have real relationships since a fellow <em>TNO</em> writer denied a mutual attraction she’d imagined, years ago. (Another Sittenfeld theme: young Hillary misreads male friendships in <em>Rodham</em>, and a similar situation plays out in the title story of Sittenfeld’s collection, <em>You Think It, I’ll Say It</em>.) “You’ve confused the romance of comedy with the comedy of romance,” Sally’s colleague told her.</p> <p>It’s a good line. But there aren’t enough of them in <em>Romantic Comedy</em>. Sittenfeld can be a master of sardonic, devastatingly arch observational wit. She employed it beautifully in <em>Eligible</em>; perhaps it helped to borrow the skeleton of the most popular romantic comedy of all time.</p> <p>Comedy is subjective, of course, but I didn’t find the jokes in this novel very funny. A skit about dogs doing Google searches fell flat. I groaned at many behind-the-scenes barbs among the comedy writers, such as Danny’s: “It’s very demeaning that you think my vagina needs cleaning. It shouldn’t smell floral when I’m getting oral.”</p> <p>And while <em>Romantic Comedy</em> convinces readers of the connection between Sally and Noah, its characters and world often lack the texture of real life. Noah, repeatedly referred to as “cheesily handsome”, often reads more like a cipher than a real person. He once greets Sally with, “Those are great fancy shoes.” Danny and Annabel’s relationship is cliched even when it tries to draw us in: Danny loves to gaze into Annabel’s eyes on her bed with a million pillows “like in the fanciest hotel”. And Sittenfeld often uses bland descriptions that show us nothing. In the <em>TNO</em> boss’ office, people sit on “the surprisingly crappy furniture in the surprisingly unfancy space”.</p> <p>The pace crawls in the section set at <em>TNO</em>, which takes up nearly half the book. Sittenfeld comprehensively researched<em> Saturday Night Live</em>; unfortunately, the text is weighed down with mechanical detail about the running of the show. The prose comparatively springs in its absence after the action moves location halfway through.</p> <p>Further drafts may have moved this novel past the stage of being bogged in research. They might have sharpened the details and honed the comedy. But as it stands, <em>Romantic Comedy</em> feels like a promising sketch for a better novel.</p> <p><em><strong>Romantic Comedy</strong></em><strong> by </strong><strong>Curtis Sittenfeld is published by </strong><strong>Doubleday, $32.99.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jo Case is deputy books and ideas editor for <em>The Conversation</em>.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "   'description': '<p>Six of the best diversions, including what to watch, read, eat and buy.</p> <h3><strong>SPOTLIGHT / Star Witness</strong></h3> <p>G<i>wyneth Paltrow’s Trial Is Her Best Role in Years</i> declared a recent headline in <i>The New Yorker</i> – and it’s not wrong. The Academy Award winner was the subject of a civil suit in a Utah court regarding a so-called ski-and-run accident in 2016. The actress was accused of running into a fellow skier while holidaying with her family. She said au contraire – <i>he</i> ran into <i>her</i>.</p> <p>The court found in Paltrow’s favour (#Gwynnocent) but no one really cared about the nuts and bolts of the case. Instead, the world binged it like a Netflix drama, tuning in to check out Paltrow’s daily court looks (she’s wearing a turtleneck!) and quoting her most iconic one-liners, including the new meme: “Well, I lost half a day of skiing.”</p> <p>It’s the latest in a long line of celebrity court battles to have captured the public fascination, stretching back to 1995 and OJ Simpson’s “trial of the century”. Last year delivered Johnny Depp v Amber Heard, which spawned a parallel trial on TikTok in which social media users declared Depp the innocent party and Heard guilty of, well, everything. A timely reminder, perhaps, that treating the courtroom as soap opera can have troubling real-world consequences. One worth remembering, given the next celebrity to take the stand will be one Donald Trump – a man who knows the power of performance better than anyone. <em><strong>Thomas Mitchell</strong></em></p> <h3><strong>SHOP / Swap shop</strong></h3> <p>Flaunting a fin-shaped design and made from repurposed coffee husks, the HuskeeCup is a stylish reminder to choose to reuse. Drinkers buy a cup, which come in a range of sizes, from a participating cafe <a href=\"https://huskee.co/8oz-cup-lid-natural/\" target=\"_blank\">(8oz cup in charcoal or natural, $20)</a> when ordering their caffeine fix, then return it when placing their next order (no need to even wash it). The “deposited” cups are sanitised and put back in rotation, with customers leaving with their fave brew in a “new” one. In due course, all cups, lids and saucers can be returned to Huskee or its swap partners – an app shows their locations – for end-of-life recycling. <em><strong>Frances Mocnik</strong></em></p> <h3><strong>EAT / Golden brown</strong></h3> <p>Spice up your weekend with a teaspoon of Golden Vadouvan, a sweet, smoky spice blend of roasted onions and garlic with turmeric, mustard seed, bittersweet fenugreek and more<a href=\"https://www.essentialingredient.com.au/products/golden-vadouvan\" target=\"_blank\"> (150g, $22.50)</a>. It’s Indian but also French, said to have been created by the French colonists of Pondicherry (now Puducherry) on India’s south-eastern coast, and it will take your salmon kedgeree to the next level. Beat it into butter to pan-fry fish and melt over carrots, or just sprinkle over your weekend eggs for an instant wow factor. <em><strong>Jill Dupleix</strong></em></p> <h3><strong>READ / Role reversal</strong></h3> <p>Ever wondered why good-looking, talented women often date average-looking but interesting guys, while the reverse rarely happens? In <i>Romantic Comedy</i> by American novelist Curtis Sittenfeld, Sally is a divorced 30-something writer for a hit TV comedy show. Fed up with seeing gorgeous female celebrities hook up with the show’s dorky male writers, she writes a sketch about it. Enter Noah, a handsome rock star and guest on the show. The sexual tension escalates as they banter their way through lockdown via email. Among the book’s pithy one-liners: “Hot eventually gets boring but funny never does.” Sittenfeld has form in analysing relationships: she’s the author of bestselling 2020 novel <i>Rodham</i>, which reimagined the life Hillary Rodham would have had if she’d not married Bill Clinton. <em><strong>Nicole Abadee</strong></em></p> <h3><strong>WEAR / Step right up</strong></h3> <p>How many pairs of shoes does a man <i>need</i>? Four, according to the founders of shoe company Etymology – Gabriel Abi-Saab and brothers William and Albert Phung. A loafer or two, an Oxford and something not black. The Sydney-based trio founded the company during the pandemic and this month released their four-pair debut collection, which leans heavily into the loafer. The all-leather shoes are handcrafted in family-run workshops in the Spanish shoe-making capital of Almansa, and <a href=\"https://etymologyau.com/products/ito-penny-loafer-black-calf\" target=\"_blank\">retail here online for $425</a> a pair. The inspiration? Abi-Saab’s Lebanese-Australian heritage: “My dad always wore this pair of loafers he found in Lebanon, even when going to the greengrocers. He took pride in the way he dressed.” Taking following in dad’s footsteps to a whole new level. <em><strong>Melissa Singer</strong></em></p> <h3><strong>WATCH / Dead Ringers</strong></h3> <p>It’s always a concern when a TV series or film casts an actor to star opposite themselves; the double-up can be great but can also be a gimmick used to paper over a thin plot. It worked a treat for Eddie Murphy in <i>Coming To America</i> but not in <i>The Nutty Professor</i>, while John Malkovich proved there is no such thing as too much Malkovich in <i>Being John Malkovich</i>. Thankfully, British actress Rachel Weisz is so charming in <i>Dead Ringers</i> (Amazon Prime) that you never get sick of seeing her star alongside herself. In this modern take on David Cronenberg’s 1988 thriller, Weisz plays twin gynaecologists whose desperation to change how women give birth pushes them into ethically questionable territory. <em><strong>Thomas Mitchell</strong></em></p> <p><b>To read more from</b><b><i> Good Weekend </i></b><b>magazine, visit our page at</b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i></b></a><b>,</b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i></b></a><b> and</b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i></b></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>The interaction of the past with the present is the faultline on which great stories are built, sure. But many <i>Sex and the City </i>superfans were dismayed to learn, via the trailer for the second series of <i>SATC</i>’s sequel <i>And Just Like That, </i>that the show will recycle Carrie’s old boyfriend Aidan into her life.</p> <p>Aidan Shaw was one of the two most important of Carrie’s love interests during the long-running show, the beta male in the love triangle he (unwittingly) participated in with Carrie and the horrendous Big.</p> <p>Big was the alpha whose emotional avoidance was dressed up as mystery, a man so emotionally unavailable that Carrie never even felt entitled to use his real name (which turned out to be John – apt because Big/John was revealed to be decidedly average once Carrie finally captured him and they settled down).</p> <p>Aidan was folksy and handsome, a carpenter who worked with his hands and wore lumberjack shirts without any apparent sense of irony. He loved his dog. He loved Carrie. He made a chair that she bought for her apartment. What could be so bad about that?</p> <p>As many <i>SATC</i> scholars have elucidated since, Aidan didn’t <i>really</i> love Carrie just as she was. He hated her smoking. He hated her going out. He hated her attachment to her glamorous lifestyle. Had he even met Carrie? That’s all she was – a smoker with a glamorous lifestyle who enjoyed going out a lot.</p> <p>Aidan hauled Carrie, the Manhattan denizen fuelled by Cosmopolitans and the <i>New York Times</i> Style section, into the woods to hang out at his bug-infested cabin. He trapped her into commitment by buying the apartment next door and knocking down the wall between them. She felt invaded. Was it any wonder she resumed the ciggies in secret and started an affair with the now-married Big?</p> <p>Yes, Carrie was awful: neurotic, flighty, self-absorbed and terrible with money. But she was not as bad as the men she dated.</p> <p>To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the iconic show – which was probably the biggest single cultural influence on women of a generation – <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/sex-and-the-city-20th-anniversary-worst-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Vanity</em><i> Fair</i> published an article titled “Who was the worst man on <i>Sex and the City</i>?”</a></p> <p>It’s a close-fought contest. My vote would go to the horrid Jack Berger, a brooding wannabe literary novelist who went into a prolonged sulk when Carrie’s (non-literary and therefore inferior, in his eyes) book was published to great success.</p> <p>Many of Carrie’s romantic trials involved men who were attracted to her success and independence but were threatened by it. Big at least let Carrie be Carrie. But even the bad men of <i>Sex and the City</i> all had something superficially attractive about them.</p> <p>The annals of romantic comedy are full of unkempt and even oafish men who score hot babes – think the 2007 Judd Apatow film <i>Knocked Up</i>, in which a stoner slacker (played by Seth Rogen) wins over the successful and attractive Alison, after impregnating her during a one-night stand. Or <em>Notting Hill</em>, where the hopeless Hugh Grant character snags a movie star.</p> <p>Woody Allen’s entire <i>oeuvre </i>(which has become tricky anyway, for other well-documented reasons I won’t delve into here) depends upon the premise that a beautiful, clever woman will be irresistibly drawn to a nebbish, prickly man who is deeply selfish, just because he cracks a few self-deprecating jokes and knows a lot about classic cinema.</p> <p>Many sitcoms rely on the trope of a grumpy and/or hopeless husband who is adored by his efficient and attractive wife (my favourite episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> is where Marge snaps because she doesn’t get enough help around the house; she is sent away for a break to a spa called Rancho Relaxo. But Homer is so incompetent he loses baby Maggie while his wife is away and has to call a Missing Baby Hotline to locate her).</p> <p>It has been a quarter-century since <i>Sex and the City </i>first aired, and it busted genres while creating its own. It has heavily influenced its successors – everything from the Millennial homage of <i>Girls</i>, to shows like <i>Derry Girls</i>, the delightful Irish comedy series about a group of teenagers, whose antics are set against the backdrop of Northern Ireland during the Troubles in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>In the ensuing decades, the ideal male romantic lead has evolved somewhat. The recent bestselling book by cult American author Curtis Sittenfeld, <i>Romantic Comedy</i>, up-ends the trope of the “schlubby” male hero who lands the hot, eligible chick just by making her laugh.</p> <p>The book asks why the opposite case is not often portrayed - why do we never see a frumpy-but-funny woman capturing the attention of a handsome, highly successful hero? (Although it must be said, Bridget Jones was a bit this person.)</p> <p>It then goes on to explore that very scenario, with a male love interest who is hot, talented and famous, but also slightly insecure (he wears a wig). Our hero openly admits he is no match for the clever wit of our heroine, who has sub-Hollywood looks and is skittish around commitment.</p> <p>The world’s most-read contemporary author, Colleen Hoover, who has barnstormed traditional publishing with her popular fiction, upturned the ideal of the male hero in her most famous book, <i>It Ends With Us</i>. The hero is introduced as dark, mercurial and emotionally elusive, but when the heroine finally lands him, she finds out the truth – he is prone to volcanic rages, and he hurts her when he’s in the grips of them.</p> <p>In this story, the archetypal hero is a trap, and the heroine’s real struggle is to free herself. The heroines of 2023 crave freedom, and men who will give it to them. But romance still has a momentum of its own – Hoover wrote the sequel, <i>It Starts With Us, </i>because her fans wanted her to, and they specifically told her they wanted their heroine to fall in love again and stay there, this time.</p> <p>Reader: she gave them what they wanted.<b></b></p> <p><strong>Jacqueline Maley is a columnist.</strong></p> <p><b><i>The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own. </i></b><b><i>Sign up here</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong>HOLLYWOOD</strong><br/><em><strong>Burn It Down: Power, Complicity and a Call for Change in Hollywood </strong></em><br/><strong>Maureen Ryan</strong><br/><strong>HarperCollins, $60</strong></p> <p>Maureen Ryan is as mad as hell about what’s been happening in Hollywood. And the<em> Vanity Fair</em> contributing editor has written <em>Burn It Down</em> to tell readers why. “What should be assessed is not just the creative product, its financial cost, and its efficiency (or lack thereof),” she writes, “It’s also how productive and nurturing an environment it is.” Something that she goes to great lengths to explain isn’t happening now and never has been.</p> <p>Her book, which deals mainly but not exclusively with the world of television, was written before the recent strikes by the American Writers and Screen Actors Guilds and doesn’t deal directly with the specific issues that have provoked them. But it does point to a range of resentments that have been simmering away for years, to do with how workplaces that ought to service the needs of employees have frequently become hellholes.</p> <p>To most readers, much of this won’t come as a surprise. Hollywood has long been infamous for what was once seen as routine behaviour but is now regarded as disreputable. The public testimonies of the courageous survivors of sexual assaults by men in powerful positions have exposed some of the darker activities hidden behind the surface gloss of the American film business.</p> <p>Ryan mentions in passing that she herself suffered this fate at the hands of an unnamed TV executive. She wrote at some length about it in <em>Variety</em> in October 2017, and her smouldering anger about what happened permeates the book.</p> <p>Drawing on the experiences of a young actress, she even goes so far as to liken what goes on in Hollywood to the way cults conduct themselves. “How is a cult that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day all that different from a set (or a workplace) that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day?“</p> <p>Her overall approach is messy, featuring long-winded attempts to explode myths about the Hollywood business, most of which were blasted to smithereens long ago. But she also provides compelling, detailed accounts of the failures and moral breakdowns that have occurred behind the scenes on the long-running series, <em>Lost</em> (2004–2010) and <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> (2013–2017), and that (contrary to the view that emerges, fictionalised, in Curtis Sittenfeld’s irresistible novel, <em>Romantic Comedy</em>) allegedly continue at NBC’s <em>Saturday Night Live,</em> the late-night sketch comedy show that has been around for almost half a century, and elsewhere.</p> <p>Some of her sources allow her to use their names; others choose to remain anonymous whistleblowers, fearful of the consequences for their careers if they become known as troublemakers. She manages to get a few of those accused – “the sinister forces in the shadows” – to go on the record with their responses, but most ignored her requests for interview.</p> <p>Stories abound of nightmare situations arising in writers’ rooms, on sets and in private offices, around racism, sexism, homophobia, inequitable returns for efforts, and the systemic abuse of those without power. Ryan’s crusader-like passion sometimes leads to overkill, the litany of sins that she uncovers providing more examples than required to make her points when a more selective approach would have been more effective.</p> <p>But it does mean that many of those that the system has turned into victims do get an opportunity to have their voices heard, even if only as “Joyce” or “Hannah”, or any of the other names she attaches to those who wish to avoid reprisal.</p> <p>Ryan is especially illuminating in her examination of some of the disturbing developments at <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. In this context, she cites journalist Seth Simons’ astute but unfashionable notion that stand-up comedians have long occupied a space for an ugly culture, one “where it has been OK to be a horrible person” (a point that becomes especially pertinent in the light of the coverage of Russell Brand’s transgressions).</p> <p>In the final section of the book, acknowledging that there’s no magic fix for the problems she’s identified, Ryan proposes several ways in which it might be possible to repair “the damage created by allowing toxic people – and systems – to run amok”.</p> <p>She quotes <em>The Atlantic’s</em> Adam Serwer about the best way to go about it: “The hope for a more equitable, democratic and prosperous society does not lie with enlightened corporations but with organised workers.” And, in line with this, she points to the need for writers, actors and others to work together to establish grassroots alliances and respectful workplaces in which to do their creative work.</p> <p>She ends by explaining that she’s no revolutionary, that she doesn’t actually want to burn Hollywood down. What she really wants is a business equivalent of a “prescribed burn”, one that can help prevent a wildfire. “Fire can be rejuvenating,” she writes, creating a neat analogy courtesy of <em>National Geographic</em>. “It returns nutrients to the soil … and can help young trees and other plants start to grow.”</p> <p><em>Burn It Down</em> sometimes labours its points, but the urgency with which Ryan champions her cause is both affecting and effective.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>Bill Lawrence has a gift for TV comedy and his special skill is ensembles. And while you might not be familiar with his name, it’s likely that you’ve seen, and perhaps even loved and admired, some of his work. It’s most recently on display in <em>Shrinking</em> and <em>Ted Lasso</em> (both Apple TV+), but stretches back to <em>Spin City</em> (Stan*) and <em>Scrubs</em> (Disney+).</p> <p>Dubbed “Television’s Anonymous Mogul” in a <em>Los Angeles Times</em> profile, Lawrence has been working steadily for decades. Although in his early days he was sacked from the writing team on <em>Friends</em> – “I was a kid. I misbehaved a bit,” he subsequently explained – he soon rebounded. Teaming up with Gary David Goldberg (<em>Family Ties</em>), he created <em>Spin City</em> (1996-2002), the first of his beautifully balanced ensemble comedies.</p> <p>In a long career, he’s had some misfires (remember <em>Whiskey Cavalier</em>, <em>Undateable</em>, <em>Surviving Jack</em> or <em>Life Sentence</em>? No? Not surprising). But the good ones are memorable and display a capacity to create vibrant communities in an array of settings: the New York mayor’s office in <em>Spin City</em>; a Sacramento hospital in <em>Scrubs</em> (2001-10); a fictional Florida district in <em>Cougar Town</em> (2009-15); an English soccer club in <em>Ted Lasso</em>; a Pasadena psychology practice in <em>Shrinking</em>.</p> <p>Sometimes, his series feature workplace families with artfully jumbled bags of diverse personalities; sometimes they’re biologically connected families, along with their friends, neighbours and work colleagues. In classic sitcom style, each character contributes a distinctive note to the whole: a dumb one, a daffy one, a pompous one, a smart and sassy one, a neurotic, etc.</p> <p>Wherever they live and whatever they do, in the best of Lawrence’s work these ensembles present vibrant, idiosyncratic and very funny characters in productions distinguished by clever casting and pitch-perfect tones. As neatly illustrated by <em>Shrinking</em> and <em>Ted Lasso</em>, they can bounce confidently from laugh-out-loud physical gags and goofy humour to more tender moments where the multi-dimensional characters reveal their vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Lawrence isn’t a one-man band: often his comedies are created and produced with others. <em>Ted Lasso</em> was developed with Jason Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt and Joe Kelly, and there’s a phalanx of producers, including Brett Goldstein, who plays Roy Kent. But there’s a discernible thread running through Lawrence’s productions, no matter who he’s working with, and that’s the strength of the communities that he constructs.</p> <p>One indicator of how well they’re structured is how many of the supporting characters become scene-stealers, even when the shows are ostensibly built around a prominent lead, such as Michael J. Fox in <em>Spin City</em>, Sudeikis in <em>Ted Lasso</em> or Jason Segel in <em>Shrinking</em>. That’s because the writing is so strong and the casting is spot on. The focus of <em>Spin City</em> might be Fox’s deputy mayor, but as well as giving us the wonderful Connie Britton in a feisty early role, there’s the joy of Richard Kind’s sweet, bumbling, perpetually flustered press secretary. <em>Scrubs</em> follows the misadventures of Zach Braff as the caring, adorably discombobulated Dr John “J.D.” Dorian. But Sarah Chalke’s contribution as the delightfully ditzy Dr Elliot Reid would be right at home in a classic 1930s Hollywood screwball comedy (which is high praise).</p> <p>My litmus test of a great ensemble is that it’s hard to pick a favourite character. In <em>Ted Lasso</em>, for example, there’s robust competition for that distinction: is it the magnificently monosyllabic Roy Kent? Indomitable, effervescent Keeley (Juno Temple)? Sweet Nigerian winger Sam Obisanya (Toheeb Jimoh)? Perhaps Dani Rojas (Christo Fernandez) with his sunny smile and gleeful pronouncement that “Football is life!” Titular Ted might be the main man, but, while taking nothing away from the nominal protagonist, the wealth of talent around him makes the series stronger.</p> <p>That’s also true of <em>Shrinking</em>, where co-creator and co-producer Segel plays Jimmy, a psychologist and widower grieving the recent death of his wife (Lilan Bowden) and destructively spiralling. As it begins, he’s seeking comfort in drugs and casual sex, and failing to be the parent that his wounded teenage daughter, Alice (Lukita Maxwell), desperately needs.</p> <p>Jimmy works in a practice with a trio of therapists and each of them is as much in need of supportive counselling as their patients. Gaby (Jessica Williams) is dealing with divorce and blithely maintaining she’s fine, when clearly she isn’t. Paul (Harrison Ford) is trying to manage a health issue and is troubled by a strained relationship with his adult daughter (Lily Rabe).</p> <p>Beyond the core characters is a skilfully fleshed-out community, among them Jimmy’s nosy neighbour, Liz (Christa Miller, Lawrence’s wife, who also appeared in <em>Scrubs</em> and <em>Cougar Town</em>), his best friend, hilariously fast-talking gay lawyer Brian (Michael Urie), and his patient, war veteran Sean (Luke Tennie), who’s suffering from PTSD and dealing with anger-management issues. Notably, too, Ford is in his element as the grumpy elder of the practice, a terse type who protectively guards his personal space only to find it continually invaded by his colleagues.</p> <p>As with <em>Ted Lasso</em> – whose fourth season has been the subject of fervid speculation – <em>Shrinking</em> was originally pitched with a three-season structure, with the first to focus on grief, the second on forgiveness and the final one on moving forward.</p> <p>The first season has set the bar high, with a line introduced in the first episode and repeated in the final one to significantly different effect neatly illustrating the quality of the writing. Initially, Jimmy looks lovingly at Alice and tells her how much she reminds him of her mother, an observation that’s filled with pain. In the final episode, when the line is repeated, there’s only love and pride. Without labouring the point, the series illustrates how far the pair has come.</p> <p>It’s classic Lawrence. So remember the name, because when you see it on a comedy, it’s likely to be worth watching.</p> <p><strong>* Stan is owned by Nine, the owner of this masthead.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

Each night, Cosgriff solicits her audience to find out their top 10 likes – all of which she notes down in a self-professed “book of tiny delights”.</p> <p>Interspersed with this gentle form of audience participation are humorous anecdotes and highly infectious, clever, original songs that Cosgriff belts out about her own likes while her hands move across her keyboard at a dizzying pace. Cosgriff’s a whip-smart, quick-witted, confident performer.</p> <p>It becomes clear towards the end that what undergirds the show is a simultaneous sense of sorrow and joy – it’s a credit to Cosgriff that she can hold space for both, leaving audiences with an incredibly affirming (and funny) show that marvels in the tiny profundities that make up our lives.<br/><em>Reviewed by Sonia Nair</em></p> <p><strong>COMEDY</strong><br/><strong>Patrick Golamco | Pork Adobo</strong><br/><a href=\"https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2023/shows/pork-adobo\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trades Hall, until April 23</strong></a></p> <p>Patrick Golamco is surely a lock for a Best Newcomer nomination this festival.</p> <p>Having come runner-up in the 2021 RAW Comedy National Grand Final, and storming Comedy Zone in 2022, his debut Melbourne solo show is loosely tied together by a story of visiting his 99-year-old grandmother in Manila to let her know he loves her while she may be on her deathbed.</p> <p>Through song, breakneck-speed jokes and tales of therapy gone awry, he harnesses the neurotic, introverted nature of Luke McGregor, the shake-your-head puns of Tim Vine and the pull-the-rug-from-your-feet energy of Mitch Hedberg all at once.</p> <p>There are sharp jabs at Catholics, his Chinese upbringing, and of course, tales of the titular recipe – all which are delivered with the aplomb of a festival veteran.</p> <p>At only 40 minutes in length it’s on the leaner side of shows this year.

In 2007, he won the top gong at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. If the rules allowed you to win more than once, he’d have another half-dozen on his mantelpiece.</p> <p>Make no mistake – Kitson is the greatest comedian of his generation. Even if his aversion to press, media and podcasts means the majority have never heard of him.

It’s known as a term within the cognoscenti as “the Kitson effect”.</p> <p>Does this all sound sycophantic? Probably. But is it hyperbole? Absolutely not.</p> <p>A poll conducted by Dave, a TV channel that is a subsidiary of BBC, saw British comics including the ilk of Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee, Tim Vine, Mark Watson, Jason Byrne and Greg Davies all agreeing that he reigned supreme.</p> <p>The sold-out audience for the stuttering Brit’s latest 90-minute show at 12pm on a Sunday is filled to the brim with other award-winning comics from the festival watching on.</p> <p>The show is a masterclass of delivery, quips and callbacks.

       "   'description': '<p>Disney may be better known for its theme parks and blockbuster movies, but its streaming service successfully draws on a pair of historic America television networks, spin-offs from its fabled franchises, and a growing cohort of original commissions. Putting together the platform’s essential scripted shows required difficult choices, but the list is illustrious.</p> <p><b>Abbott Elementary<br/></b>The great American sitcom is not dead, it’s just morphed into this delightfully witty mockumentary about the ever-burdened staff at a primary school in West Philadelphia. Creator and star Quinta Brunson delivers 22-minute episodes that sing with character humour and absurd machinations. Janella James, as the school’s questionable principal, is the best scene-stealer on television right now.</p> <p><b>The Americans<br/></b>What began as a sharp Cold War thriller, following a pair of Russian spies (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) living as a couple complete with children in Washington DC, became a masterful study of what we will and won’t reveal to those closest to us. Deception has rarely been so intensely intimate, culminating in a note-perfect finale after six seasons.</p> <p><b>Andor<br/></b>The rough equation is <i>Star Wars</i> with less Jedi and more John le Carre, but that doesn’t do justice to Tony Gilroy’s brilliant prequel series about how the dedicated spy from 2016’s <i>Rogue One</i> movie (Diego Luna), found his calling as a revolutionary. Dispensing with nostalgia but staging gripping set-pieces, this is a galaxy far, far away reimagined for adults.</p> <p><b>Arrested Development<br/></b>Ignore the subsequent Netflix revival, the original three seasons of this wonderfully loopy comedy about a dysfunctional family’s downfall constitute one of the funniest shows of this century. Jason Bateman is the dutiful son trying to hold everything together, but he’s surrounded by self-sabotaging kin whose antics are perfectly shaped by dry digressions, meta-commentary, and brain-bending ramifications.</p> <p><b>Atlanta<br/></b>Donald Glover’s surrealist-tinged comedy about a struggling college graduate (Glover) who works as the manager of his rapper cousin (an immense Brian Tyree Henry) was one of the most ambitious shows television has witnessed, and mostly it succeeded. The implications of being Black in America spiralled into uncomfortable realities, otherworldly horror, and soulful self-recognition.</p> <p><b>The Bear<br/></b>”Yes, chef!” A blackly comic drama about a fine dining savant (Jeremy Allen White) returning to run his late brother’s Chicago sandwich joint, the two seasons to date of this series have been defined by corrosive tension, whiplash humour, and family dynamics that are painfully gripping. Watching creativity and renewal take hold for these characters is both a blessing and a curse.</p> <p><b>Bob’s Burgers<br/></b>It took a season to get going but Loren Bouchard’s animated sitcom about the family behind a New Jersey burger joint has become one of television’s enduring pleasures. The Belcher clan are a wonderful mix of characters, driving a winning sense of humour that eschews pop-culture references for a depiction of the everyday that is charmingly plausible.</p> <p><b>Buffy the Vampire Slayer<br/></b>The original slay queen, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Geller) is a Californian high school student chosen to battle the forces of evil. It’s the first of many inspired mash-ups in this deeply influential supernatural adventure, which shines as a tale of feminist empowerment, a goofy serial, and a homage to friendship powered by rat-a-tat dialogue.</p> <p><b>Desperate Housewives<br/></b>Is it a soap opera or a satire of a soap opera? Marc Cherry’s blockbuster comedy about the many intrigues surrounding a group of neighbouring married women was both and much more. Upending how network television depicted wives, life on Wisteria Lane was wild, insightful, and given to almighty twists.</p> <p><b>Homeland<br/></b>Episodic television has rarely seen a performance as fierce and finely judged as the one Claire Danes delivers in this spy drama, playing an obsessive CIA agent with bipolar disorder. The early seasons, with Damian Lewis as a possible foe hiding in plain sight, are a sinewy two-hander, before Danes’ Carrie Mathison becomes the focus of a taut, globe-trotting study of betrayal and sacrifice.</p> <p><b>How I Met Your Mother<br/></b>If you crave the reassuring familiarity of a multi-camera studio sitcom, the nine seasons of this Hollywood comedy about the loves and laughs of a group of (initially) twentysomethings will hit the spot. The punchlines are sharp but the casting is perfect: Jason Segel, Cobie Smulders, Alyson Hannigan, and a fearless Neil Patrick Harris shine.</p> <p><b>Loki<br/></b>The one television spin-off of Marvel’s movie blockbusters that mattered follows the titular brother of Thor, Tom Hiddleston’s capricious, arrogant Loki, who finds himself caught up with the agency regulating time itself and its representative, Owen Wilson’s laconic investigator. The unlikely duo’s double act is the show’s selling point, a give and take that is verbally dexterous and emotionally primed.</p> <p><b>Lost<br/></b>The network drama that didn’t so much kick the door in for grandiose ambitions as knock the entire house down, the 121 episodes of this science-fiction laced epic gave us smoke monsters, temporal shifts, labyrinthine conspiracies and a handful of finely revealed characters. The mysterious island they were trapped on was a puzzle box of vast possibility, somehow kept in motion through six seasons.</p> <p><b>Mrs America<br/></b>Cate Blanchett, Rose Byrne, and Uzo Aduba headline an exemplary cast in this historical drama about the 1970s battle in America between second-wave feminists and the conservative women who opposed them. This is a vivid, telling recreation, with depictions of real-life figures that are anything but textbook – these public and private conflicts are both nuanced and prescient.</p> <p><b>The Muppet Show<br/></b>As the oldest show on this list – it ran between 1976 and 1981 – there are certainly dips in Jim Henson’s ground-breaking reinvention of the variety show, but Kermit, Miss Piggy, and their iconic fellow hand puppets thoroughly transcend the era. The best guests gave the backstage absurdity an artful, idiosyncratic charge, with guests like Elton John, Gilda Radner, and John Cleese.</p> <p><b>NYPD Blue<br/></b>Controversial when it debuted in 1993, Steven Bochco and David Milch’s police procedural about a fictional Manhattan precinct raised the bar for the cop drama with intertwining storylines, pungent dialogue, and reflections on trauma. David Caruso ducked out after one season, but the pairing of Jimmy Smits and Dennis Franz gave the show a memorable core that carried it to classic status.</p> <p><b>One Mississippi<br/></b>Debuting in 2015 and unfairly cancelled after just two seasons, comedian Tig Notaro’s semi-autobiographical series has her playing a breast cancer patient who returns to her hometown to care for her dying mother. The observational comedy that ensures is deeply personal, heartbreaking in its misunderstandings, and willing to suspend reality to grasp deeper truths. This hidden gem is ripe for rediscovery.</p> <p><b>Only Murders in the Building<br/></b>Steve Martin, Selena Gomez, and Martin Short are aces together in this farcical crime caper about a trio of true crime podcast addicts who start recording when a neighbour in their NYC apartment block is murdered. It’s a rapid-fire satire and deadpan comedy of manners, but its secret weapon is a melancholic undertow that makes the motives tragic and the investigators dedicated to their unlikely friendship.</p> <p><b>The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story<br/></b>The murder trial that transfixed America 30 years ago is re-examined in a limited series that reveals the distorting nature of fame, rampant ego, and sexist double standards. In an all-star cast none surpass Courtney B. Vance as defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran: a showman created by the very system he despises.</p> <p><b>Pose<br/></b>Boisterous with a bittersweet chaser, this drama recreates in stunning detail the ball subculture in 1980s New York, where Black and Latino drag queens competed for recognition in private tournaments while representing their unofficial families. It’s hectic and not always subtle, but the show does what its historic subjects did: it claims space for the marginalised and lets their stories resonate.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': '‘Something is going to happen’: Jerry Seinfeld hints at sitcom reunion',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>It’s like Festivus for <em>Seinfeld</em> fans. Jerry Seinfeld has hinted that he and his fellow cast members might make a return to the classic ’90s sitcom.</p> <p>Answering a question from the audience about whether he liked <em>Seinfeld’s</em> final episode at a stand-up show in Boston, the 69-year-old comedian said he had a “little secret” about the ending.</p> <p>“But I can’t really tell it because it is a secret,” he said. “Here’s what I’ll tell you, OK, but you can’t tell anybody. Something is going to happen that has to do with that ending. Hasn’t happened yet.”</p> <p>Seinfeld indicated to the audience that he was already in discussions with Larry David, who created one of the greatest sitcoms in television history with him.</p> <p>“And just what you are thinking about, Larry and I have also been thinking about,” he said. “So you’ll see, you’ll see.”</p> <p><em>Seinfeld</em>, which also starred Jason Alexander, Michael Richards and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, ran from 1989 to 1998. Its popularity has endured through countless repeats on free-to-air TV and streaming services and a long list of catchphrases that have entered the vernacular, including “no soup for you”, “double dipper”, “close talker”, “giddyup!“, “Hello, Newman”, “master of my domain”, “They’re real and they’re spectacular!“, “yada yada yada” and “Not that there’s anything wrong with that”.</p> <p>The finale was an extended episode that had Jerry, Elaine, Kramer and George jailed for violating a local law after their private plane was force to land in a small town in Massachusetts. It received mixed reviews from critics and fans but was watched by a massive 76.3 million fans – 58 per cent of the audience – in the US alone.</p> <p>There was immediate speculation about whether the reunion was for a commercial, possibly for the Super Bowl, or whether it was for the 12th and reputedly final season of David’s sitcom <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>.</p> <p>But given filming wrapped on the last episode months ago, Seinfeld’s reference to “hasn’t happened yet” suggests it is not that. In 2009, the four <em>Seinfeld</em> stars appeared in the seventh season of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> when David tried to initiate a reunion of the sitcom to win back his ex-wife.</p> <p>Could it be a reboot for a streaming service like <em>Frasier</em> or <em>Full House</em>? That’s unlikely given Seinfeld seems content doing stand-up and whatever else he feels like doing, and <em>Forbes</em> has reported he had earned $US267 million from the show in 1998 and refused NBC’s offer of more than $US100 million to make a tenth season.</p> <p>Seinfeld has previously teased the cast returning.</p> <p>On <em>The Daily Show With Jon Stewart</em> in 2007, he mentioned possibly shooting one last scene where the characters had left jail. On the DVD for the final season of <em>Seinfeld</em>, the comedian said he and Alexander had spoken about this scene being in Monk’s Cafe.</p> <p>But at the end of the Boston show, details of the reunion were in the vault.</p> <p><strong>Email Garry Maddox at <a href=\"mailto:gmaddox@smh.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">gmaddox@smh.com.au</a> and follow him on Twitter at <a href=\"mailto:gmaddox@smh.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">gmaddox@smh.com.au</a>.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56jp0\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

It said Microsoft’s billion-dollar investment would help OpenAI build what was called artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a machine that could do anything the human brain could do.</p> <p>Later, as Altman sipped a sweet wine in lieu of dessert, he compared his company to the Manhattan Project. As if he were chatting about tomorrow’s weather forecast, he said the US effort to build an atomic bomb during World War II had been a “project on the scale of OpenAI — the level of ambition we aspire to.”</p> <p>He believed AGI would bring the world prosperity and wealth like no one had ever seen. He also worried that the technologies his company was building could cause serious harm — spreading disinformation, undercutting the job market. Or even destroying the world as we know it.</p> <p>“I try to be upfront,” he said. “Am I doing something good? Or really bad?”</p> <p>In 2019, this sounded like science fiction.</p> <p>In 2023, people are beginning to wonder if Altman was more prescient than they realised.</p> <p>Now that OpenAI has released an online chatbot called ChatGPT, anyone with an internet connection is a click away from technology that will answer burning questions about organic chemistry, write a 2000-word term paper on Marcel Proust and his madeleine, or even generate a computer program that drops digital snowflakes across a laptop screen — all with a skill that seems human.</p> <p>As people realise that this technology is also a way of spreading falsehoods or even persuading people to do things they should not do, some critics are accusing Altman of reckless behaviour.</p> <p>This past week, more than a thousand AI experts and tech leaders called on OpenAI and other companies to pause their work on systems such as ChatGPT, saying they present “profound risks to society and humanity.”</p> <p>And yet, when people act as if Altman has nearly realised his long-held vision, he pushes back.</p> <p>“The hype over these systems — even if everything we hope for is right long term — is totally out of control for the short term,” he told me on a recent afternoon. There is time, he said, to better understand how these systems will ultimately change the world.</p> <p>Many industry leaders, AI researchers and pundits see ChatGPT as a fundamental technological shift, as significant as the creation of the web browser or the iPhone. But few can agree on the future of this technology.</p> <p>Some believe it will deliver a utopia where everyone has all the time and money ever needed. Others believe it could destroy humanity. Still, others spend much of their time arguing that the technology is never as powerful as everyone says it is, insisting that neither nirvana nor doomsday is as close as it might seem.</p> <p>Altman, a slim, boyish-looking, 37-year-old entrepreneur and investor from the suburbs of St Louis, sits calmly in the middle of it all. As chief executive officer of OpenAI, he somehow embodies each of these seemingly contradictory views, hoping to balance the myriad possibilities as he moves this strange, powerful, flawed technology into the future.</p> <p>That means he is often criticised from all directions. But those closest to him believe this is as it should be. “If you’re equally upsetting both extreme sides, then you’re doing something right,” said OpenAI’s president, Greg Brockman.</p> <p>To spend time with Altman is to understand that Silicon Valley will push this technology forward even though it is not quite sure what the implications will be. At one point during our dinner in 2019, he paraphrased Robert Oppenheimer, leader of the Manhattan Project, who believed the atomic bomb was an inevitability of scientific progress. “Technology happens because it is possible,” he said. (Altman pointed out that, as fate would have it, he and Oppenheimer share a birthday.)</p> <h3>The vegetarian cattle farmer</h3> <p>The warning, sent with the driving directions, was “Watch out for cows.”</p> <p>Altman’s weekend home is a ranch in Napa, California, where farmhands grow wine grapes and raise cattle.</p> <p>During the week, Altman and his partner, Oliver Mulherin, an Australian software engineer, share a house on Russian Hill in the heart of San Francisco. But as Friday arrives, they move to the ranch, a quiet spot among the rocky, grass-covered hills. Their 25-year-old house is remodelled to look both folksy and contemporary. The Cor-Ten steel that covers the outside walls is rusted to perfection.</p> <p>As you approach the property, the cows roam across both the green fields and gravel roads.</p> <p>Altman is a man who lives with contradictions, even at his getaway home: a vegetarian who raises beef cattle. He says his partner likes them.</p> <p>On a recent afternoon walk at the ranch, we stopped to rest at the edge of a small lake. Looking out over the water, we discussed, once again, the future of AI.</p> <p>His message had not changed much since 2019. But his words were even bolder.</p> <p>He said his company was building technology that would “solve some of our most pressing problems, really increase the standard of life and also figure out much better uses for human will and creativity.”</p> <p>He is very much a product of the Silicon Valley that grew so swiftly and so gleefully in the mid-2010s. As president of Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley startup accelerator and seed investor, from 2014-19, he advised an endless stream of new companies — and was shrewd enough to personally invest in several that became household names, including Airbnb, Reddit and Stripe. He takes pride in recognising when a technology is about to reach exponential growth — and then riding that curve into the future.</p> <p>His longtime mentor, Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, explained Altman’s motivation like this: “Why is he working on something that won’t make him richer? One answer is that lots of people do that once they have enough money, which Sam probably does. The other is that he likes power.”</p> <h3>‘What Bill Gates must have been like’</h3> <p>In the late 1990s, the John Burroughs School, a private prep school named for the 19th-century American naturalist and philosopher, invited an independent consultant to observe and critique daily life on its campus in the suburbs of St Louis.</p> <p>The consultant’s review included one significant criticism: The student body was rife with homophobia.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, Altman, a 17-year-old student at John Burroughs, set out to change the school’s culture, individually persuading teachers to post “Safe Space” signs on their classroom doors as a statement in support of gay students such as him. He came out during his senior year and said the St Louis of his teenage years was not an easy place to be gay.</p> <p>Georgeann Kepchar, who taught the school’s Advanced Placement computer science course, saw Altman as one of her most talented computer science students — and one with a rare knack for pushing people in new directions.</p> <p>“He had creativity and vision, combined with the ambition and force of personality to convince others to work with him on putting his ideas into action,” she said. Altman also told me that he had asked one particularly homophobic teacher to post a “Safe Space” sign just to troll the guy.</p> <p>Graham, who worked alongside Altman for a decade, saw the same persuasiveness in the man from St Louis.</p> <p>“He has a natural ability to talk people into things,” Graham said. “If it isn’t inborn, it was at least fully developed before he was 20. I first met Sam when he was 19, and I remember thinking at the time: ‘So this is what Bill Gates must have been like.‘”</p> <p>Altman is not a coder or an engineer or an AI researcher. He is the person who sets the agenda, puts the teams together and strikes the deals. As the president of Y Combinator, he expanded the firm with near abandon, starting a new investment fund and a new research lab and stretching the number of companies advised by the firm into the hundreds each year.</p> <p>He also began working on several projects outside the investment firm, including OpenAI, which he founded as a non-profit in 2015 alongside a group that included Elon Musk. By Altman’s own admission, Y Combinator grew increasingly concerned he was spreading himself too thin.</p> <p>He resolved to refocus his attention on a project that would, as he put it, have a real impact on the world. He considered politics, but settled on AI.</p> <p>Altman believed, according to his younger brother Max, that he was one of the few people who could meaningfully change the world through AI research, as opposed to the many people who could do so through politics.</p> <p>In 2019, just as OpenAI’s research was taking off, Altman grabbed the reins, stepping down as president of Y Combinator to concentrate on a company with fewer than 100 employees that was unsure how it would pay its bills.</p> <p>Within a year, he had transformed OpenAI into a non-profit with a for-profit arm. That way, he could pursue the money it would need to build a machine that could do anything the human brain could do.</p> <h3>The man in the middle</h3> <p>In March, Altman tweeted out a selfie, bathed by a pale-orange flash, that showed him smiling between a blond woman giving a peace sign and a bearded guy wearing a fedora.</p> <p>The woman was Canadian singer Grimes, Musk’s former partner, and the hat guy was Eliezer Yudkowsky, a self-described AI researcher who believes, perhaps more than anyone, that AI could one day destroy humanity.</p> <p>The selfie — snapped by Altman at a party his company was hosting — shows how close he is to this way of thinking. But he has his own views on the dangers of AI.</p> <p>Yudkowsky and his writings played key roles in the creation of both OpenAI and DeepMind, another lab intent on building artificial general intelligence.</p> <p>He also helped spawn the vast online community of rationalists and effective altruists who are convinced that AI is an existential risk. This surprisingly influential group is represented by researchers inside many of the top AI labs, including OpenAI. They don’t see this as hypocrisy: Many of them believe that because they understand the dangers clearer than anyone else, they are in the best position to build this technology.</p> <p>Altman argues that rather than developing and testing the technology entirely behind closed doors before releasing it in full, it is safer to gradually share it so everyone can better understand risks and how to handle them.</p> <p>He told me that it would be a “very slow takeoff.”</p> <p>When I asked Altman if a machine that could do anything the human brain could do would eventually drive the price of human labour to zero, he demurred. He said he could not imagine a world where human intelligence was useless.</p> <p>If he’s wrong, he thinks he can make it up to humanity.</p> <p>He rebuilt OpenAI as what he called a capped-profit company. This allowed him to pursue billions of dollars in financing by promising a profit to investors such as Microsoft. But these profits are capped, and any additional revenue will be pumped back into the OpenAI non-profit that was founded back in 2015.</p> <p>His grand idea is that OpenAI will capture much of the world’s wealth through the creation of AGI and then redistribute this wealth to the people. In Napa, as we sat chatting beside the lake at the heart of his ranch, he tossed out several figures — $US100 billion, $US1 trillion, $US100 trillion.</p> <p>If AGI does create all that wealth, he is not sure how the company will redistribute it. Money could mean something very different in this new world.</p> <p>But as he once told me: “I feel like the AGI can help with that.”</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p> <p><strong><i>The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion. </i><i>Sign up to get it every weekday morning</i><i>.</i></strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong>FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Firelight</strong></em><br/><strong>John Morrissey, Text, $32.99<br/></strong><br/>First Nations fiction and sci-fi might sound like strange bedfellows, although anyone who saw the Shadow Spirit exhibition at Melbourne’s Rising festival this year (which featured First Nations <em>Star Wars</em> characters alongside ancient stories and cultural knowledge) will know how fertile their conjunction can be. Kalkadoon author John Morrissey has produced a suite of short stories – some of them sci-fi, most within the realms of magical realist or speculative fiction – that investigate colonialism and identity with a keen eye and an uninhibited imagination. It’s a volume that features a little green man and the colonisation of the Moon, fraught attempts by scientists to reconstruct a thylacine, and a Gothic-tinged revenge fantasy in which an Aboriginal warrior haunts the white explorer responsible for his murder. An elegant and unpretentious narrative style allows Morrissey to reach for outlandish or bizarre elements with the irreducible impact of a lucid dream. It’s a fable-like, inventive, and well-crafted collection.</p> <p><em><strong>Serengotti</strong></em><br/><strong>Eugen Bacon, Transit Lounge, $32.99</strong></p> <p>Eugen Bacon’s<em> Serengotti</em> follows Ch’anzu, a gender-nonconforming narrator, on a day from hell. Ch’anzu loses hir job, and walks in (totally hungover) on hir wife Scarlet having pneumatic sex with a guy half her age. The opening chapters are set in contemporary Melbourne but there’s a hyperactive buzz of disorientation and dislocation in the prose, which has a futuristic feel and surges forward using the unusual second-person perspective. You’re put into Ch’anzu’s shoes as hir life crisis leads first to the wisdom of Aunt Mae, and on to a migrant African community, Serengotti, deep in the Australian bush. Eugen Bacon has a propulsive experimental style that voraciously incorporates idiom from urban, internet, Australian and African contexts to forge something new. Momentum builds quickly in this rush of a novel, which illuminates questions of gender and race as they are experienced, and has a sharper focus on how the world turns in urban Australia than most new fiction.</p> <p><em><strong>Prophet</strong></em><br/><strong>Helen Macdonald &amp; Sin Blache, Jonathan Cape, $34.99</strong></p> <p>Co-written during lockdown by Helen Macdonald (<em>H is for Hawk</em>) and Sin Blache,<em> Prophet</em> literally weaponises nostalgia. The title refers to a military-grade chemical that causes those exposed to it to fall into a nostalgic trance, creating figments of the past from treasured memories. Naturally, such a weapon could be disastrous in the wrong hands. And perhaps there are no right hands, as two agents – super-buff American action hero Adam, and dissolute but sharp-minded Rao, a former British intelligence operative – discover. Following Prophet’s destructive trail from Britain to the American West, it seems Prophet has new properties waiting to be unleashed. This sci-fi queer romance espionage thriller smashes together a bewildering array of genre fiction tropes, but it’s obsessively crafted, and has the kind of philosophical underpinning that makes it read more like postmodern fabulism than fanfic.</p> <p><em><strong>Temperance</strong></em><br/><strong>Carol Lefevre, Wakefield, $34.95</strong></p> <p>It’s 1963 and widowed café owner Stella Madigan struggles to make ends meet after the death of her husband. The arrival of unconventional artist Mardi Rose promises a reprieve from working-class life for Stella and her young children, Fran and Theo, but when they embark upon a road trip to Byron Bay, they make it only as far as the tiny hamlet of Temperance in the Australian Outback. There, a horrifying and half-remembered incident turns the family back, and it will plague the children into their adult lives. Award-winning writer Carol Lefevre has a deft touch for psychological drama and the intricacies of domestic relationships. Here she takes a tightly stretched working-class canvas and loosens it into an evolving mystery (and a deferred coming-of-age tale) spanning decades. Lefevre is particularly good at showing the subtle effects of trauma, and the intensity of repressed emotion.</p> <p><strong>NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK</strong><br/><em><strong>Beeswax and Tall Tales</strong></em><br/><strong>Jane Crowley with Athol Salter, Ventura Press, $32.99</strong></p> <p>This polished collection of tales from the antiques trade could easily have been sub-titled “Life’s Little Ironies”, for the way it reflects human foibles in all their variety. Jane Crowley’s father, Athol Salter, has spent a lifetime buying and selling antiques and throughout that time continually shared the stories he gathered along the way with his daughter. Written from her father’s point of view, the stories are full of intriguing characters, from shifty types who get their comeuppance, a sad widower in Wagga whose last wish before suiciding is denied him by big-city lawyers, and a Welsh collector whose dying business is, to an extent, emblematic of the trade. And all of them revolving around selling artefacts, be it a bath, a chiffonier or an old farm table. Lovingly crafted and sure-footed, this could become a collector’s item.</p> <p><em><strong>Girls [Don’t] Play Sport</strong></em><br/><strong>Chloe Dalton, Allen &amp; Unwin, $34.99</strong></p> <p>When Chloe Dalton was young watching her brothers play rugby she would practise kicking at half-time, often being told by adults that she should play the game. Her reply was, “Girls don’t play rugby”. In 2016 she won Olympic rugby gold in Rio. Her journey, her successes and her experience inform this combination of treatise and memoir. It also provides a snapshot of women in sport, citing, say, the struggle that swimming legend Fanny Durack had to get to the 1912 Olympics. In what is basically a call to arms she highlights the achievements, and prejudices that women’s sport still faces: pay, training facilities, misogyny, trolling and the reaction to the now iconic photo of Tayla Harris goaling from the 50-metre mark. Deeply passionate, her enthusiasm is infectious, and we can only hope one day nobody will think twice about girls playing footy – or any other sport, for that matter.</p> <p><em><strong>The Chipilly Six: Unsung Heroes of the Great War</strong></em><br/><strong>Lucas Jordan, NewSouth, $34.99</strong></p> <p>It takes a certain type of larrikin daredevil to do what six Australians soldiers did in the middle of the Battle of Amiens in August 1918. The allied offensive had been stopped by a line of German machine gunners on the spur above the Somme village of Chipilly. Repeated frontal assaults had failed. During the morning sergeants Jack Hayes and Harold Andrews went for a “stroll” into the village looking for souvenirs – as you do. That night they led a patrol of six, flanked the German gunners and took them out, capturing 71 prisoners and nine machine guns – achieving what an entire army couldn’t. It’s impossible to read this ripping, vivid recreation of events without shaking your head in disbelief. For years history paid scant attention to the “six”. This account (covering post-war years) and drawing on firsthand testimony corrects that.</p> <p><em><strong>The Shrinking Nation</strong></em><br/><strong>Graeme Turner, UQP, $32.99</strong></p> <p>This is a sort of report card on Australian politics over the past 15 years, and it’s not good. The phrase “must try harder” comes to mind. Australia and the world have changed enormously in that time, but our national governments have gone missing in vital areas such as climate change, social welfare and closing the gap. The period, especially from Tony Abbott’s government on, was marked by what we might call policy paralysis, the ship of state was left to drift and the country has shrunk, so it’s “less than it was, less than it should be”. Graeme Turner’s clear, emphatic, convincing examination is a big-picture study of a time when the big picture deserted our politics. It’s also a searing indictment of decades of neo-liberalist hypocrisy. But there’s also hope, with Turner seeing positives in the busyness of the Albanese administration.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

Even though the plot hinges on a diagnosis of terminal cancer, fun and romance have equally important parts to play.</p> <p>Michael Showalter’s film of the book drops the spoiler from the title, but we learn the worst in the opening scene. Then we’re into a flashback recounting what is essentially a love story. It begins in 2001 when Ausiello (Jim Parsons) and Kit Cowan (British actor Ben Aldridge) meet at a Manhattan club.</p> <p>They’re an unlikely pair. Kit is a buff, charming photographer who has always preferred casual sex to steady relationships, and Michael (Jim Parsons) is a nerdy vegetarian who drinks Diet Coke and wears button-down shirts buttoned up. He’s an entertainment journalist with a special interest in sitcoms and soaps. And that’s not all. When Kit is finally permitted to visit his apartment, he finds that it’s been colonised by the Smurf collection Ausiello has been acquiring since childhood.</p> <p>Ausiello wrote the book after Kit’s death. It grew from a series of Facebook posts read by the couple’s family and friends, one of whom was an editor at Simon &amp; Schuster. And Showalter has succeeded in catching its spirit – its intimacy, its self-deprecating sense of humour and Ausiello’s habit of seeing life through the prism of the television shows he loved as a kid. Both his parents died when he was young and the shows take him back to the times when he was at his happiest. So, too, does the Smurf collection.</p> <p>Kit’s parents are very much alive. His mother, Marilyn (Sally Field) competes in triathlons – despite her stately pace and dodgy knees – and his father, Bob (Bill Irwin) is kept busy carrying out his wife’s orders. Kit’s relationship with Michael finally gives him the courage to tell them that he’s gay and they do better than approve. They embrace Michael as a surrogate son.</p> <p>The film is episodic in shape. The couple go through many ups and downs during the 13 years they spend together and the script canvasses them all. Sometimes the tone is a little too cute but Showalter (<em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em>) and his writers have a persuasive ability to defuse the looming threat of sentimentality with comedy.</p> <p>Aldridge is terrific as the easy-going Kit, who’s been blessed with such physical confidence that the disease comes as both shock and betrayal, and Field knows exactly when to rein in the indomitable Marilyn. It’s a disarming film.</p> <p><strong><em>Spoiler Alert</em> is in cinemas from February 9.</strong></p> <p><b><i>A cultural guide to going out and loving your city. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=culture-fix\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up to our Culture Fix newsletter here</a></i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': '‘Bubble of chaos’: Tony Shalhoub on his Marvelous Mrs Maisel character',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>Speaking from his New York apartment on the eve of an international press tour to promote the fifth and final season of <i>The Marvelous</i><i> Mrs Maisel</i>, Tony Shalhoub is happy and sad. The award-winning stage and screen actor (<i>Big Night, Wings, Monk</i>) knows that he’s been part of something special, a TV series that he appreciatively describes as “rare”. But for him and his fellow cast and crew members, whom he describes as “tightly knit”, there’s also regret that it’s come to an end.</p> <p>However his pride in the celebrated period comedy’s nine-episode final season is evident. “The scripts were great,” he says, adding that the showrunners, creator, writer, producer and director Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, writer, producer and director Daniel Palladino, “really know how to land a plane.” With the final scenes shot in November, he reflects, “It’s been a great world to occupy and I think that we all feel that we would’ve loved it to go on for at least one, if not two, more seasons. But they all have to come to an end at some point, I guess.”</p> <p>Premiering in 2017, the series immediately made its mark as a lavish, witty and vibrantly colourful production that seemed as though it was itching to bloom into a Hollywood musical. Set in the late-1950s, it charted the initially accidental career of a Jewish mother of two in the cut-throat, male-dominated world of comedy. And its New York looked like jewel-box fantasy land, from the uptown delis to the inky downtown clubs.</p> <p>The series deftly establishes its title character, Miriam “Midge” Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan), as a woman who possesses a natural, yet untapped, gift for stand-up. That’s until one drunken night when, having discovered her husband’s infidelity, she stumbles on stage at a club and proceeds to unload her piercing observations about men and marriage. It then follows her bumpy progress, including the horror of her parents, Abe and Rose Weissman (Shalhoub and Marin Hinkle), when they discover where she’s sneaking out to at night.</p> <p>In addition to its lush look, the series has been distinguished by cracking, densely written dialogue, fired off at machine-gun speed. Finely crafted barrages between the characters are often coupled with elaborate, flowing, single-take shots (known as “oners”) which are frequently choreographed through bustling settings: department stores, diners, hotels.</p> <p>Describing the oners, Shalhoub says, “It seemed like an ambitious way to work, but a lot of us have worked in the theatre and it’s reminiscent of that. You just have to shift your thinking: you’re doing one-act plays every day as much as you’re shooting television. It calls upon the kind of discipline that the theatre requires, forcing you to listen more, to be more focused, and it’s gratifying. It brings out everyone’s best because, when it works, it’s exhilarating. And when we stumble, it’s understandable because it’s a high-wire act.”</p> <p>The style of the series created the need for a production that operated differently from the customary TV model. “Normally, the amount of time that you have to rehearse is limited,” says Shalhoub. “Sometimes the oners would take a whole morning to rehearse, and that’s very rare. Normally you set up the blocking quickly, get the camera angles in there, light it and go, go, go. Because you’re always playing beat-the-clock. This series had a different kind of energy.”</p> <p>As Midge made her way through the comedy scene, Shalhoub’s character confronted his own obstacles. Abe started out as a university professor, secure in his place in the world, moved on to commercial consulting work, lost his job and eventually became a cravat-wearing theatre critic. Meanwhile Midge’s mother, Rose, turned her talent for matchmaking into a business.</p> <p>“They live in a kind of bubble of chaos,” says Shalhoub of the Weissmans. “But they’re all fighters. We see Midge survive a broken marriage and a challenging rollercoaster career as a stand-up. I can’t help but think that it’s kind of hereditary in the sense that’s she’s a survivor and Abe and Rose are that way too. They come from that kind of stock.</p> <p>“Thanks to our brilliant writers, Abe and Rose have an opportunity to reinvent their lives. They just won’t roll over and give up. I think Midge carries that with her too and we see that played out in Midge and Joel’s (Michael Zegen) children: they’re scrappy and they survive.”</p> <p>That kind of development is also rare, he observes: “It’s a luxury for an actor. If you’re on a long-running series, there’s always that danger of getting painted into a corner, where you’re called on to do just a few things, repeated and repeated. I think that the writers have serviced all of the characters really well.”</p> <p>While Abe is shown to sometimes be pompous and fairly clueless in dealing with his young grandchildren, Shalhoub views his character’s shortcomings with affection: “He’s a man of his time. It was part of the culture, the zeitgeist, and for me it’s what makes the writing interesting and relevant. That’s the brilliance of starting this story in the late ’50s and moving it into the early ’60s because that’s the time when a whole cultural shift was commencing.”</p> <p>He also notes that there are developments in the final season that surprised him. It features inspired flashes-forward to the 1980s, allowing viewers to see, in tantalising drip-feeds, where some of the characters end up 20 years later. “There are things in the final few episodes that happen to Abe that I did not see coming,” says Shalhoub. “When we first meet Abe, his grandchildren are there, they’re underfoot, so to speak. But being a man of his time and his age, he thinks that it’s the job of his children to worry about those children, that they should be seen-and-not-heard kind of thing. But in the later episodes we see Abe’s awakening and investment in that next generation.”</p> <p>While aware that a special project has come to a close, Shalhoub is moving back to the future, starting work on a telemovie revival of his Emmy-winning, obsessive-compulsive detective character, Adrian Monk, whom he played for eight seasons until 2009. “There was talk over the years that we should we revisit it, but now feels like the right moment,” he explains. “It’s Monk having gotten through the pandemic and being knocked on his heels again.” Then he adds with a chuckle, “He’s older now, so, for my sake, he’s not doing the kinds of things that he did 15 years ago, like chasing down garbage trucks. He’s not that guy any more. It’s only one telemovie, but who knows, we’ll see how it goes.”</p> <p>But as he prepares to reacquaint himself with Monk, he’s farewelling an ambitious production that he sees as “colourful, celebratory, a big gigantic musical”, the marvel that is <i>Mrs Maisel.</i></p> <p><strong>The Marvelous Mrs Maisel (fifth season) is on Amazon Prime Video from Friday April 14.</strong></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'The 20 best shows to stream on Netflix right now',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>It’s a near-impossible task, but the finished list is worth the struggle. In compiling Netflix’s 20 essential shows, I had a few simple parameters: scripted only (no documentaries or reality fare), mix the signature hits with the lesser-known, and recognise the breadth of the streaming service’s programming. Your favourite show might not be here, then again neither is mine.</p> <p><strong>Beef</strong></p> <p>Starting with a road rage incident and escalating to vengeful pranks, this black farce about a pair of Los Angeles residents – played by Ali Wong and Steven Yeun – appears to be a barbed contemporary comedy, but scene by scene it goes deeper into the characters, their failings, and ultimately their connection. It is a masterful, arresting transformation.</p> <p><strong>Black Mirror</strong></p> <p>Charlie Brooker’s science-fiction anthology debuted 12 years ago, which means that some of the dystopian concepts he built each season’s handful of episodes around no longer feel like mordant speculation. But the best episodes – start with <em>San Junipero</em> – still resonate in ways both fascinating and fearful, and the show’s evolution is fascinating to trace.</p> <p><strong>Bodyguard</strong></p> <p><em>Line of Duty</em> creator Jed Mercurio pushed his talent for tense thrillers punctuated by whiplash reveals to the limits with this limited series about a British personal protection officer and traumatised war veteran (Richard Madden, in his finest performance) assigned to a hard-as-nails cabinet minister (Keeley Hawes). The dynamic between the two is one of many combustible elements here.</p> <p><strong>BoJack Horseman</strong></p> <p>Hollywood satires tend to be snarky and short-sighted, so naturally it took an animated series where the Los Angeles subjects are anthropomorphic animals to really twist the knife. Daft at first encounter, full of visual delights, and psychologically acute, the story of the titular equine sitcom star (perfectly voiced by Will Arnett) dug deeper across six seasons than most prestige dramas ever could.</p> <p><strong>Borgen</strong></p> <p>The definitive political drama of the 21st century, this Danish series originally aired for three seasons between 2010 and 2013, with its depiction of power – how to wield it, what it costs – gripping when intermixed with piquant characters. Netflix added a sharply drawn fourth season last year, and the show’s many telling observations remain relevant.</p> <p><strong>The Crown</strong></p> <p>The closer this historic drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II has got to the present day, the more its spell has dissipated. Nonetheless, Peter Morgan’s royal drama is one of Netflix’s signature shows and the Claire Foy and Olivia Colman eras as Her Majesty are sumptuous character studies of privilege, contradiction and immaculate insults.</p> <p><strong>Dark</strong></p> <p>Seriously, don’t be flippant with this dense German drama: you’re in for three seasons of increasingly complex narratives, as events in an orderly town are tied together through time travel patterns every 33 years. It is bleakly gripping – mournful cellos yes, humour no – as kidnapped children and temporal conspiracies abound, but its depiction of regret and inevitability is also tragically beautiful.</p> <p><strong>Derry Girls</strong></p> <p>Has there ever been a sitcom as silly and yet sublime as Lisa McGee’s ode to her 1990s high school misadventures in Northern Ireland during the final years of sectarian conflict. Historic events and being banned from the local chippy intertwine as a group of teenage girls – and their plus-one male English cousin – plot wildly and act badly. The funniest coming of age tale going.</p> <p><strong>The Good Place</strong></p> <p>A classic American network sitcom in structure – 22-minute episodes! – loaded with inventive ideas, ingenious gags and moral quandaries, the four seasons of this metaphysical comedy find a group of wayward strangers exploring the afterlife. It is in turn nutty, soulful, and stacked with note-perfect performances (take a bow, Ted Danson).</p> <p><strong>The Haunting of Hill House</strong></p> <p>Filmmaker turned showrunner Mike Flanagan is Netflix’s resident horror auteur: year after year he updates classic horror tales or modifies the genre. My pick of his limited series is the first, which matches a group of siblings’ haunted house experience as children with their experience as emotionally damaged adults. Much is terrifying here, including familial bonds.</p> <p><strong>Hilda</strong></p> <p>Gorgeously animated – words to the effect of “Hayao Miyazaki in Scandinavia” are rightfully found in many reviews – the two seasons of this children’s series follow the adventures of the titular 11-year-old (voiced by <em>The Last of Us</em> star Bella Ramsey). The tone can be bittersweet or chaotic, as Hilda’s outings go from the mundane to the fantastical and she begins to comprehend the wider world’s flaws.</p> <p><strong>I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson</strong></p> <p>After three seasons of this genius sketch comedy series, it’s got to the point where I laugh so uncontrollably hard that my oldest son simply calls out “Tim Robinson” from another room. Absurd but always a step ahead of your expectations, Robinson’s pieces explore the extremes of social limits.</p> <p><strong>Monty Python’s Flying Circus</strong></p> <p>Tom Robinson, and many other sketch comics, wouldn’t have a career if it wasn’t for this feted troupe of British comics. Netflix has all four seasons of their BBC show, which debuted in 1969 and paved the way for their classic film comedies, and while time and a changing society has shaded certain numbers, there is still one-of-a-kind brilliance here.</p> <p><strong>Mindhunter</strong></p> <p>When the two circles on your Venn diagram are filmmaker David Fincher and infamous serial killers of the 1970s, you’re in for an intense series. A study of detail and dread, this impeccable psychological thriller follows a pair of outlier FBI agents and a female psychology professor interviewing jailed mass murderers such as Son of Sam.</p> <p><strong>Never Have I Ever</strong></p> <p>Netflix recently wrapped up, with a satisfying mix of teenage realisation and timeless awkwardness, this coming-of-age comic-drama, as Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and her pals finished high school. Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher’s show was always funny, but it grew more perceptive about its Indian-American lead and the rigours of adolescence with each season. Bonus: an amazing celebrity narrator.</p> <p><strong>Seinfeld</strong></p> <p>The era-defining sitcoms of the 1990s are lucrative trophies in the streaming era, with Netflix currently home to all 180 episodes of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David’s celebrated comedy about a group of New Yorkers with the worst of intentions. Riffing off minor misunderstandings and friendly misdemeanours, this 20th century classic has episodes assembled with clockwork precision and hilarious send-offs.</p> <p><strong>Squid Game</strong></p> <p>The games without frontiers that punctuated this shocking and addictive drama turned Netflix’s South Korean production arm from stealth success to superstar. With a harsh undercurrent of inequality fuelling the fantastical limits, a group of strangers find themselves in an underground competition where children’s games are literally a matter of life and death.</p> <p><strong>Stateless</strong></p> <p>A funding arrangement means that Netflix ends up taking the ABC’s scripted shows to the world, while providing a valuable second chance locally. It means you can rediscover this coruscating 2020 drama about Australia’s refugee detention regime, with co-creator Cate Blanchett in a supporting role. The multiple storylines deliver startling detail and unadorned empathy.</p> <p><strong>Stranger Things</strong></p> <p>Netflix’s biggest shows – and few are bigger than this 1980s supernatural horror homage – have redefined what a successful global franchise can be. Strip-mining their favourite movies of the era, creators the Duffer Brothers created a popcorn panopticon that’s become a streaming event even as recent seasons took their time getting up to speed.</p> <p><strong>Unbelievable</strong></p> <p>Here are your truest detectives. Based on real-life events, Toni Collette and Merritt Wever are riveting as Colorado police officers who partner up to catch a serial rapist. Their relentless search is an exceptional procedural, but it’s elevated by the heart-rending parallel story of a survivor (Kaitlyn Dever) trying to endure a system meant to help her.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'The Bear’s second season is even better than the first',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><b>The Bear (season 2) ★★★★★ <br/></b>Disney+, Wednesday</p> <p>The second season of <i>The Bear</i>, the kitchen fire comic-drama about a celebrated chef trying to save both his family’s sandwich spot and himself, achieves something few shows do. It takes an acclaimed first season and furthers – and deepens – its best qualities. These 10 new episodes, which follow the Chicago neighbourhood restaurant’s fine dining rebirth, not only complement their predecessors, they serve up new insights, telling history, and unexpected paths forward. It is, like the dishes this crew aspire to make, an artisanal wonder.</p> <p>With its kitchen chaos and second-degree burn banter, the first season was about survival. The second asks what’s next? Obsessive head chef Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) wants a life of sorts – he Googles “fun” – and to break the cycle of kitchen abuse. “I’m trying to start from a healthy place,” he tells a support group, and there are strands of optimism both in and out of the kitchen. Carmy reconnects with high school classmate Claire (Molly Gordon), while flinty line cook Tina (Liza Colon-Zayas) thrives with formal training.</p> <p>Creator Christopher Storer makes exemplary use of the furious energy and grace notes thrown off by the first season. You can understand not only why the characters want to improve, but how difficult that truly is – Carmy’s fellow chef, Sydney Adamu (Ayo Edebiri), struggles to trust him because he is brilliant but wayward. The structure gives the supporting cast side mission episodes, such as gifted young pastry chef Marcus Brooks (Lionel Boyce) learning at a Noma-like restaurant in Copenhagen.</p> <p>The ticking clock remains, but now it’s the ludicrously short 12 weeks to refit The Beef and reopen as The Bear. Given the show’s dedication to capturing the culinary business, it’s a detailed whiplash experience; you will learn how crucial a “fire suppression system” is. But alongside that there are scenes that offer experience and transcendence, as when Sydney keeps visualising a meal in her head while frequenting real-life Chicago eating establishments for inspiration.</p> <p>The show’s ambitions are not minor. One episode, an hour-long flashback, sets up a Berzatto family gathering that is both captivating and terrifying. The cast is studded with name actors, who are difficult to fault individually but collectively feel a touch too much. And even then the portrait the episode paints is so valuable that you can’t fault them for going all out. “You’re going to have to care about everything more than anything,” Carmy tells Sydney. And <i>The Bear </i>is nothing if not that.</p> <p><b>Full Circle ★★★★ <br/></b>Binge</p> <p>Steven Soderbergh used to treat crime stories as a director’s magic act – he exulted in misdirection and showmanship. But the filmmaker is long past <i>Ocean’s Eleven</i> and his new limited series is about how everything unravels, most notably the lies we deceive ourselves with. Set before and after a botched kidnapping that ties together multiple strands, <i>Full Circle</i> has a churning momentum – enhanced by noir-like strings – that is gripping.</p> <p>Ed Solomon’s dense script reveals the fateful crime from high above and up close, tying together a wealthy Manhattan corporate family, including CEO Sam (Claire Danes) and her celebrity chef father Jeff (Dennis Quaid), and the naive young Guyanese men, Xavier (Sheyi Cole) and Louis (Gerald Jones), flown north to work for a Queens crime syndicate. The fallout is too heavy for anyone to not only control but even carry.</p> <p>The quirks are sharply jarring: the lead investigator, Harmony (Zazie Beetz), is driven and intuitive, but possibly also unstable – her scenes with Danes have a vivid frequency. The come-full-circle motif is plain throughout, but Soderbergh’s masterful direction and cinematography (under a pseudonym) keep the narrative rolling. The warm washes of light his characters move through remain, but they’re just momentary refuges. No one is truly safe.</p> <p><b>Sleeping Dog<br/></b>Netflix</p> <p>A knotty crime thriller by design, this six-part German mystery works best as a character study of Mike Atlas (Max Riemelt), a former police detective now living homeless on the fringes of society who must re-examine his past when an old case resurfaces and he begins to doubt his work. The plot ranges across guilt, vengeance and institutional corruption, but it’s best illustrated by the tenuous bond between Atlas and a young prosecutor, Jule Andergast (Luise von Finckh), who initially judges him by his circumstances.</p> <p><b>Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band – The Legendary 1979 No Nukes Concert<br/></b>Paramount+</p> <p>It takes a fair amount of confidence to add “legendary” to the title of your own performance, but this Madison Square Garden benefit set was for decades a revered bootleg among Bruce Springsteen fans until it got an official release in 2021. The just-released concert film backs up the self-belief: a few days shy of turning 30, Springsteen was on the cusp of becoming rock music’s central figure. A suitably ragged multi-camera shoot is all energy and outreach, complete with an unstoppable performance of <i>Born to Run</i>.</p> <p><b><i> </i></b></p> <p><b>Foundation (season 2)<br/></b>Apple TV+, Friday</p> <p>Few shows are taking as big a swing as this epic adaptation of Isaac Asimov’s canonical science-fiction novels about the millennium-long clash between a galactic Empire and the scientist who foresaw its demise. With Lee Pace and Jared Harris as adversaries, the show mostly manages to tie together personal stakes and planet-hopping history in a way that sci-fi aficionados will enjoy. Creator David S. Goyer reportedly plans eight seasons (the third is already shooting) and his approach is sound: the use of physical locations grounds the storytelling in ways green screens can’t.</p> <p><b><i> </i></b></p> <p><b>E2 Design<br/></b>Shelter</p> <p>Narrated by Brad Pitt, this succinct, informative documentary series ranges across the many applications of sustainable architecture. Without being contradictory, the narrative rewrites assumptions: the first episode explores how New York is per capita one of the greenest cities in America, because of the density of population, public transport usage, and collective consumption. In looking at Manhattan’s next generation of skyscrapers, the show details both the technical means and personal will required to improve building techniques. Subsequent episodes head to China and rural Mexico.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong>You Hurt My Feelings ★★★★</strong><br/><strong>(MA) 93 minutes</strong></p> <p>Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ athletic comic rhythm of pushiness followed by self-doubt hasn’t shifted much since her <em>Seinfeld</em> days. But in the right context her reflexes are as sharp as ever, as she shows in Nicole Holofcener’s expertly funny <em>You Hurt My Feelings</em>, which tackles many topics that might easily have been debated by the <em>Seinfeld</em> gang: when you should throw out your underwear, for instance, or the etiquette of sharing an icecream cone.</p> <p>Also in the <em>Seinfeld</em> tradition is the attention given to the minutiae of language, especially in relation to status. Is it really a compliment if you tell someone they look “adorable”, or if you describe a literary work as “pleasing”?</p> <p>Such nuances loom especially large for Louis-Dreyfus’ character Beth, a New York writing teacher who has just finished her first novel (a follow-up to her moderately successful memoir <em>I Had To Tell It</em>, which recounts her traumatic childhood history of “verbal abuse”).</p> <p>Her husband Don (Tobias Menzies) has supported her through draft after draft – but, as she discovers through an overheard conversation, the enthusiasm he expresses to her face may not be entirely genuine.</p> <p>Don, who works as a therapist, has comparable reason for unease in his own professional domain, as do Beth’s sister Sarah (Michaela Watkins) and Sarah’s husband Mark (Arian Moayed), an interior decorator and an actor respectively.</p> <p>Indeed, just about every scene in <em>You Hurt My Feelings</em> offers a new variation on the theme, with one or more of these characters forced to make the awful choice between kindness and honesty, wondering how far they’re being politely lied to in turn, or facing the challenge of dealing with negative feedback when it arrives.</p> <p>Seemingly less prone to such anxieties is Beth and Sarah’s caustic mother Georgia (the great Jeannie Berlin) whose bluntness gives a sense of where at least some of her daughters’ neuroses might have sprung from.</p> <p>As in Holofcener’s earlier comedies of manners such as <em>Friends With Money</em>, the approach here is slightly abstracted but never too heightened: the terrific actors have all come to play, but their characters aren’t reduced to pure sitcom types.</p> <p>Don’s sessions with his patients are portrayed with some realism – refreshingly, he appears to be neither great at his job nor terrible – and unlike on <em>Seinfeld</em> everyone is allowed at least the possibility of genuine psychological growth, though it’s always a matter of small steps rather than big leaps.</p> <p>To use another dubious term of praise, it’s all highly relatable, however distant you might feel from this particular social circle of well-off New Yorkers. Holofcener knows as well as anyone around how to make us cringe and laugh by turns, or simultaneously – and I’m not just saying that.</p> <p><strong><em>You Hurt My Feelings</em> is in cinemas from June 15.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong><em>Bupkis</em>, Binge</strong><br/>★★½</p> <p>How you feel about <i>Bupkis</i> (Yiddish for “absolutely nothing”) probably depends on how you feel about its creator and star, Pete Davidson.</p> <p>As a title card and accompanying voice-over announces at the beginning of each of its eight half-hour episodes, “this program is inspired in part by real people and events” – the principal one being its co-creator, co-writer and star.</p> <p>Davidson is a former <i>Saturday Night Live</i> cast member (he joined the line-up at age 20, making him one of the youngest regulars on the sketch comedy series since its debut 48 years ago). But he’s arguably best known for his romantic entanglements with a string of high-profile women, including Ariana Grande, Kate Beckinsale (20 years his senior), Margaret Qualley (the actress daughter of Andie MacDowell) and Kim Kardashian.</p> <p>He doesn’t reference any of them directly in this series, which consists largely of aimless bits of business in and around New Jersey with his posse of kind-of-useless friends (like an east coast version of <i>Entourage</i>), punctuated with sub-Tarantinoesque dialogue about such pressing topics as the correct pronunciation of the word “cuisine”.</p> <p>But he does reference two other major points from the Davidson biography: the death of his firefighter father in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in New York; and the fact he lives with his mother Amy.</p> <p>She is played here by Edie Falco, who is easily the best thing in the show. She’s pushy, far too willing to use her son’s fame to her own advantage, and utterly disregarding of the needs of her other child, Casey.</p> <p>She is the other half of a codependent relationship whose oddness we are exposed to in the show’s opening scene when she walks in on her son masturbating while wearing a VR headset.</p> <p>It’s a grossly hilarious moment that is rarely equalled. Much of the time is spent riding around in cars with the comedian and his friends, often in a fug of marijuana smoke, rarely to much end. Occasionally, something threatens to happen; an episode set in Florida that echoes <i>Spring Breakers</i> and the <i>Fast and Furious</i> franchise promises much, but soon peters (sorry) into ridiculousness.</p> <p>You can’t fault the casting, though. Bobby Cannavale crops up as an old family friend who offers child Pete the kind of advice guaranteed to shape him as a particularly retrograde kind of young man. Steve Buscemi appears as a Catholic priest who tells him his father is still around, as a virtual reincarnation of Jesus. Joe Pesci plays the grandfather who is on his last legs, but determined to go out kicking.</p> <p>What they all have in common is that they are father substitutes for the bereft Davidson. And while that opening disclaimer adds “certain parts” of the show have been fictionalised “solely for dramatic purposes and are not intended to reflect on any actual person or entity”, this bit at least rings true. Davidson is a sad clown, haunted equally by the absence of his father and the overbearing presence of his mother.</p> <p>That gives it a certain pathetic dramatic quality, but as comedy, it’s kinda bupkis.</p> <p><b><strong>Find more of the author’s work <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/by/karl-quinn-hvecw\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

       "   'description': '<p>Australia’s top chief executives almost unanimously expect the domestic economy to skirt a recession next year despite lingering inflation, pressure on household budgets and the prospect of a long monetary pause.</p> <p>CEOs from the banking, mining, retail, property and industrials sectors expect Australia’s economy to slow in the coming year, which along with cost pressures could mean a tougher 2024 for business and pressure on planned investment.</p> <p>“We’re likely to avoid a hard landing in 2024,” Goodman Group founder and CEO Greg Goodman said.</p> <p>“It’s also likely that inflation will keep slowing as a result of the interest rate rises we’ve seen. The business climate is, however, going to be more difficult, with spending more subdued.”</p> <p>Macquarie Group’s Shemara Wikramanayake said Australia’s immigration profile and strength in key industries should keep the country out of recession in 2024; however, slower economic growth should bring inflation back to the Reserve Bank’s targeted range by the end of the year.</p> <p>“Broad-based inflationary pressures, driven by relatively strong economic demand and a tight labour market, will likely abate in the face of this slower growth,” Ms Wikramanayake said.</p> <p>Commonwealth Bank boss Matt Comyn said there was only low risk of a recession next year, although that would increase should high inflation persist and the RBA needed to increase official interest rates further.</p> <p>“Given the sharp rise in interest rates over the past 18 months, we think we are at, or very close to, the top of the current rate cycle,” Mr Comyn said.</p> <p>The comments were made as part of <em>The Australian Financial Review</em>’s annual Chanticleer survey of more than 50 top ASX CEOs. Nearly all said higher interest rates and inflation were likely to slow growth; however, they pointed to immigration and infrastructure spending as reasons why Australia would avoid a recession.</p> <p>Wesfarmers CEO Rob Scott said the homegrown cost pressures, including staff costs and raw materials, were the “greatest challenge to inflation” in the coming year.</p> <p>“We are seeing significant increases in supply chain costs, wages, power and other services,” said Mr Scott, whose company owns hardware retailer Bunnings Warehouse, discount retailer Kmart and a big industrials chemicals business.</p> <p>“There are risks of further pressures in 2024 with additional regulation and compliance costs, and less flexibility in the workplace to adjust to dynamic changes in the market will ultimately increase costs if we are not careful.”</p> <p>CEOs with consumer-facing businesses said cost-of-living pressures would keep customers rethinking their spending habits and choices. Even so, they kept referring to the economy as “resilient”.</p> <p>“I think most people have been surprised at how resilient the economy has been this year in spite of global shocks and interest rate hikes, so we’re cautiously optimistic that resilience continues,” said Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson, who took over from Alan Joyce in September.</p> <p>“What we’re seeing is that demand across Jetstar and Qantas remains above pre-COVID levels, despite cost-of-living pressures.”</p> <p>Coles CEO Leah Weckert, also new to her role, agreed customers were feeling the fiscal pinch: “Overall, we are optimistic about the resilience of the Australian economy and, in particular, non-discretionary sectors like supermarkets,” she said.</p> <p>Woolworths’ Brad Banducci was reluctant to make any economic predictions, but said the government’s revised approach to skilled migration had helped address labour shortages that should ease cost pressures in the economy.</p> <p>“It will allow Australia to better attract the talent we need to fill critical skills gaps and labour shortages across the economy, in turn supporting productivity growth,” Mr Banducci said.</p> <p>“The ‘Skills In Demand’ visa is a big step forward and will help bring experts with emerging skills and expertise into Australia to help train and develop local team members.”</p> <p>Elliott Rusanow, who runs Westfield owner Scentre Group and is a major landlord to the likes of Coles and Woolworths, said consumers were still spending up big at the shops.</p> <p>“When you look at the consumer, aggregate consumer spending is also high,” Mr Rusanow said. “We’re seeing this play out in our business partner sales which are at record levels.”</p> <p>Seven Group’s Ryan Stokes was one of only a few outliers who said there was a “high risk” of a hard economic landing and there was little room for further interest rate tightening.</p> <p>“The resilience shown to date can only withstand so many shocks inflicted by the RBA,” Mr Stokes said.</p> <p>“The RBA’s approach to the cash rate will eventually trigger the economic contraction they are targeting ... In short, rates have already moved too far too quickly. Patience needs to be demonstrated. Further rate increases are not required in the near term.”</p> <p>Newmont CEO Tom Palmer, an Australian whose company bought Australia’s biggest listed goldminer Newcrest Mining this year, said it was too early to declare victory in the fight against inflation.</p> <p>“Until there is a sustained and honest effort to increase productivity in Australia through genuine reform, the RBA has little option but to use the blunt instrument of cash rate increases to try and reduce inflation,” Mr Palmer said.</p> <p><em>With Ciara Seccombe and Edmund Tadros</em></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>Seven high-profile Australian men share the best advice their fathers gave them, and how that’s played out in the way they live.</p> <h3>Cameron Daddo, Smooth FM announcer</h3> <p>Dad [Peter] told me I should learn about money so I enrolled in a finance course but lasted 18 months. I wanted to be in entertainment. Dad helped negotiate my first TV contract. He put them over the griller and got me a decent deal. He has great business acumen and is a people person. His advice? Know how to back yourself. Another key moment was when my wife Alison’s home birth with our third child went pear-shaped. As I left for hospital, Dad grabbed me and said “take care of your family”. Those words resonated; I’d been strongly influenced by people outside the family on how to raise one. A few years later, I got a bad review for a theatre show. Dad told me it takes more balls to do what I did than to be the person reviewing.</p> <h3>Tim Rogers, Musician</h3> <p>My dad, Adrian, gave advice by his actions rather than his words. He was a kind and patient man and that made a huge impression on me. He never raised his voice and always tried to make someone’s job easier – whether at his work or in the hospitality industry, he was nice to everyone. He worked in engineering and mining, and was involved in local sporting teams. I never heard him get swept up in politics. He was the quiet type, which could be infuriating at times, though I found his ability to remain calm quite impressive – he knew the value of silence. I found out 13 years ago he was adopted. I asked him why he never told me. He replied, “You never asked.” Dad died two years ago and I couldn’t get to his funeral due to the lockdown.</p> <h3>Max Gawn, Melbourne AFL player and Lululemon ambassador</h3> <p>My dad, Rob, has never missed a game of footy ever since I started playing under 9s, including 15 years of me playing AFL, except when he couldn’t get to Perth when we won the grand final in 2021. He doesn’t know much about footy but always has advice after a game! Perhaps the most memorable advice he gave was when I got my driving licence: “Treat every other driver on the road like an idiot.” I have always remembered that and haven’t had a crash. Dad is good at letting me be me, and I am taking that approach into fatherhood. Dad came to Australia with Mum and my two older brothers from NZ. I was born here. I saw what he did by way of example – being a hard-working man – and I have applied that to what I do.</p> <h3>Jamie Durie, Gardening expert and collaborator with Gus Modern</h3> <p>The best advice my dad, Dave, gave me was to “get a trade behind you, son”. I did that with my four years of study in horticulture and it was the best thing I ever did. Little did I know it would put me into the position of taping 56 lifestyle TV shows, hosting <em>The Block</em> for the first two seasons, doing <em>Backyard Blitz</em> for eight, winning seven Logie Awards, authoring 14 books and securing a five-year contract with Oprah Winfrey. I had no plans to be on TV. It all happened by accident. Had I not learnt the basics and crafted my expertise in design and horticulture with that plant knowledge, there is no way I would have been on TV. Dad’s advice is the best anyone has given me. He’s been an incredible father to me my entire life, and still is.</p> <h3>Costa Georgiadis, Host of <em>Gardening Australia</em></h3> <p>My dad, Stanley, was an incredible individual – incredibly strong, not just physically but mentally. He had a clear and simple approach when doing things – if you do it, do it right. His advice was to be focused on what you’re doing. The Mr Miyagi moment for me as a kid was when he used to make me vacuum the pool. The vacuum cleaner was only 400 millimetres wide and the pool was 10 metres long. You had to move slowly. If you went fast, you’d stir up the dust and make a bigger job for yourself. He’d say, “Not good enough, do it again.” Dad taught me to be focused. Now, if I am doing a task, I stay in the moment. I carry that presence of mind and action because of Dad. That’s an incredible gift he gave – to have pride in your work.</p> <h3>Curtis Stone, Celebrity chef</h3> <p>My dad, Bryan, was a finance manager and always gave me good business advice. He is quite conservative, and told me to work hard and save money and not take too many chances. I think that stood me in good stead, even though I didn’t listen to him all the time. He had high expectations but wasn’t unrealistic; if you made a mistake, he gave you a chance to fix things. I felt his advice most through my teenage years – he was at every sporting event I played. It’s that stability and assurance that has played out well for me because I saw him not overreact and just deal with things when they didn’t go right. He taught me how to be balanced in tough situations. I am more of a risk-taker than he was and still have a great relationship with him.</p> <h3>Craig Foster, Commentator and former Socceroo</h3> <p>We grew up in a working class, sport-oriented family in Lismore, NSW. Dad [Kevin] was a competitive cricketer and tennis player. He didn’t give advice by way of expressing or dictating it. It was the way Dad conducted himself and treated his three sons and people outside the family that spoke louder than words. Dad was a motor mechanic who ran his own business. He had a fierce belief in fairness. If someone was disadvantaged or couldn’t pay for a repair, he would often fix it for nothing. We all played sport professionally and he told us to treat players equally. He said the better you do and the higher you go, the humbler you should be. That you are no more special than other people. Dad had an inclusive nature and it rubbed off on us.</p> <p><b><i>Make the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our</i></b><b><i> Live Well newsletter</i></b><b><i>. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56j6k\" target=\"_blank\">Get it in your inbox</a> every Monday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'What would Agatha Christie make of this not-so-cosy mystery?',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><strong>CRIME FICTION</strong><br/><em><strong>Death in the Sauna</strong></em><br/><strong>Dennis Altman</strong><br/><strong>Clouds of Magellan Press, $34.99</strong></p> <p>It’s leather night at Spartacus, a discreet London sauna that is a meeting place for gay men. It’s also two days before a Global AIDS Conference, and Pomfrey Lister, the eminent virologist, founder and President of the Global AIDS Trust, is lying naked and serenely dead in a cubicle with a half empty bottle of amyl nitrate in his hand. So begins Dennis Altman’s elegant whodunnit in which everyone, in true Agatha Christie mode, is a suspect.</p> <p>The author of <em>Homosexual: Oppression and Liberation</em>, first published in 1971, Altman is a distinguished academic who has himself served on the board of many AIDS initiatives across the world. Here he draws on that experience to present a wry, poignant, restrained murder mystery that unfolds against the backdrop of a major AIDS convention in 2003. In relation to which, there’s some amusing asides about the minor royal who opens the event who would clearly much rather be at Wimbledon, and the missing wife of a central Asian despot who went shopping two days earlier and hasn’t been seen since.</p> <p>Sadly, the man who might have managed these various hiccups is now dead. Summoned to the sauna, Pomfrey’s colleague and rival for control of the Trust, Spencer Carson, thinks it would be much better if Pomfrey were discovered at home, in bed, dead of a massive heart attack.</p> <p>So does Mary, Pomfrey’s wife, who has yet to come to terms with her husband’s double life, and so Pomfrey’s body is immediately relocated and quickly cremated. But there are suspicions.</p> <p>The unlikely sleuth in this telling tale is Noel, Pomfrey’s former lover. A mild-mannered second-hand bookseller, Noel just happened to spot Pomfrey’s bright red Bentley outside Spartacus on the night in question and suspects Pomfrey was cheating on him. For his own peace of mind, Noel needs to know. He thought they had made a commitment.</p> <p>After teaming up with Sylvie, Pomfrey’s former assistant, who incidentally collects early editions of Agatha Christie novels, Noel embarks on a quest to determine Pomfrey’s fidelity, or not. Searching for the attendant who first discovered his lover’s body, Noel heads to Brighton. There he stays in the rather shabby gay bed and breakfast establishment, Brigadoon, run by the irrepressible Maurice who is rehearsing for the role of Miss Prism in the Brighton Wilde Players production of<em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>.</p> <p>What is so endearing and engaging about Altman’s first crime novel is that all the characters, however minor, have intricate lives and backstories that render them profoundly human, even if their motives and actions might be questionable. Take Mary, Pomfrey’s widow, who bears “a slight resemblance to Judi Dench”. Her AIDS work in Africa involving virginity and abstinence is based on her belief that sex is the cause “of so much misery.” No wonder Pomfrey strayed.</p> <p>Altman’s touch is deft and his wit razor sharp. Agatha would have surely approved, but I’m not sure what she would have made of leather night at Spartacus.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'How Patricia Field ‘reunited’ Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>Fashion can be a unifying force. Want proof? Patricia Field, the veteran film and television costume director, arguably most famous for her work on <em>Sex and the City</em>, managed to do what Hollywood could not – bring feuding actresses Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall to the same screen.</p> <p>Both stars of <em>Sex and the City</em> appear in a new biopic, <em>Happy Clothes: A Film About Patricia Field</em>, with several scenes showing Cattrall and Field cavorting around Manhattan.</p> <p>The two became close during <em>SATC</em> and Field now works on Cattrall’s latest show, <em>Glamorous</em>, in which she plays a supermodel turned beauty mogul – a kind of <em>Devil Wears Prada</em> (another credit that earned Field an Oscar nomination) meets the cosmetics industry.</p> <p>So strong is the bond between the women that Cattrall only agreed to make a cameo on <em>Sex and the City</em> sequel <em>And Just Like That </em>if Field dressed her (Field turned down <em>AJLT</em> due to scheduling clashes with filming for <em>Emily in Paris; </em>the show’s costumes are directed by Molly Rogers, Field’s right hand on <em>SATC</em>, and Danny Santiago).</p> <p>Field, 81, says via Zoom that she had been approached numerous times over the years about making a documentary, but it wasn’t until director Michael Selditch ambushed her with a “sizzle reel” that she agreed. Fame, she says in an early scene in <em>Happy Clothes,</em> doesn’t sit naturally with her.</p> <p>“I’m in over my head. All of a sudden, I became this famous person. I worked, and enjoyed the work, for years but, somehow, recognition found me and in a certain way, I’m a little nervous about it,” she says while puffing on a cigarette – a Field trademark as ubiquitous as her cherry red hair and thick-rimmed glasses.</p> <p>The film’s title is a direct quote from Field, a self-described “exaggeration queen” who often pairs seemingly incongruous combinations on screen – clashing colours, prints and silhouettes – to create a surprising seamlessness.</p> <p>It’s how one of <em>SATC’s</em> most famous outfits – Parker, as Carrie Bradshaw, wearing a tutu on the streets of Manhattan in the opening credits – came to be, even if the show’s creator, Darren Star, didn’t fully comprehend it at first.</p> <p>“I said, ‘You know, Darren, this is not something trendy, this is something that will last forever, and stay fresh’,” Field says.</p> <p>And it worked. Fans of the show still buy $US140 ($210) replicas of the tutu – Parker has the original – from Field’s gallery in Lower Manhattan, a more sedate space than the store she ran for nearly 50 years, which in the 1980s was a hangout for artists, club kids and future celebrities, including RuPaul and Laverne Cox (John F. Kennedy Jr was reportedly barred once for making anti-trans slurs about the patrons).</p> <p>It was also where a young Selditch spent time, but it was only while making the 2019 documentary <em>American Style</em> that he zeroed on in on Field as a documentary subject.</p> <p>The film’s opening scene, which shows Field swimming in a pool covered in tiled mosaics, was designed to surprise. “I wanted people to be in the theatre wondering, ‘Am I in the right [movie]?’” he says.</p> <p>“Yeah, maybe they would anticipate the opening scene would be, like, at a fashion show,” Field adds.</p> <p>Instead, <em>Happy Clothes</em> takes the viewer inside Field’s “process”, scouring vintage fairs for <em>tchotchkes</em>, and to fittings with the cast of <em>Run the World</em>, billed as an all-black <em>SATC</em>. Through these snippets, we’re given a taste of some of Field’s mantras – “As long as the colours match, you can f–k around with the patterns” – and her views on modern style.</p> <p>“Today the fashion is so depressing,” she says in the film, later explaining she has grown bored by the overwhelming uniformity of dressing.</p> <p>“What I call ‘depression wear’ fashion, as opposed to ‘celebratory fashion’ ... Fashion definitely is a reflection of the time that we are living in,” she says.</p> <p>“I use the example of the 1920s – people were celebratory ... These days it’s more, I don’t know why, but maybe people feel getting overdressed isn’t cool.”</p> <p>For Field, there ain’t no such thing.</p> <p><em><strong>Happy Clothes: A Film About Patricia Field</strong></em><strong> screens at the Melbourne International Film Festival on August 5, 7 and 19. miff.com.au. <em>The Age</em> is a festival media partner.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Make the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our</i></b><b><i> Live Well newsletter</i></b><b><i>. </i></b><b><i>Get it in your inbox every Monday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>As Fashion Week kicks off in Sydney, fashionistas have a new hotel to put on their bucket-list.</p> <p>The late Karl Lagerfeld’s biggest and final hospitality project, a luxurious 271-room Macau hotel, will officially launch in June – nine years after it was first announced.</p> <p>The Karl Lagerfeld Hotel, which began welcoming guests on April 29, is part of The Grand Lisboa Palace Resort Macau and will be the world’s only hotel designed entirely by the fashion great. Lagerfeld died in 2019 age 85, four years before his vision was brought to life.</p> <p>Everything from the large-scale installations to the bathrobes and bedsheets have been touched with the designer’s creative flare. Room rates start from about 1949 Macanese Pataca ($360) a night.</p> <p>The opulent stay will feature Portuguese celebrity chef Jose Avillez’s restaurant Mesa; a palatial book lounge containing 4000 carefully selected books, displayed majestically across multiple custom wall installations; and a lavish spa and wellness centre with indoor and outdoor pools.</p> <p>Lagerfeld drew on modern chinoiserie design elements when crafting the 271 rooms and suites, which weave Chinese symbols and silhouettes with Western aesthetics. Custom-made round silver and gold headboards take inspiration from Chinese coins, to signal prosperity, while circular room dividers are reminiscent of classic Chinese moon gates.</p> <p>A moody palette of black, gold and crimson features throughout the property’s rooms and public spaces; noticeably absent is the colour pink, which Lagerfeld famously believed wasn’t “flattering” on anyone. Fashion writer Patrick Mauries credited the designer as once saying: “Think pink. But don’t wear it.”</p> <p>Lagerfeld collaborated with Italian design lighting brand Terzani, Dutch artist Marcel Wanders and French artist Jean-Michel Othoniel to create a number of commissioned works, including chandeliers, furnishings and sculptures.</p> <p>It’s the latest property by SJM Resorts, whose stable of brands include Palazzo Versace Macau, Grand Lisboa and Ponte 16.</p> <p>The former Chanel creative director worked with SJM on the hotel’s design for many years prior to his death in 2019.</p> <p>The hotel launch comes on the back of <em>Vogue</em>’s annual Met Gala, which was themed this year “In Honour of Karl”, in tribute to the late German designer’s extensive body of work in fashion. The theme <a href=\"http://p5cvwp\" target=\"_blank\">drew criticism from activists</a> due to Lagerfeld’s legacy of fat-phobic, sexist and homophobic comments, including such comments as “These are fat mummies sitting with their bags of crisps in front of the television, saying that thin models are ugly,” and “If you don’t want your pants pulled about, don’t become a model!”</p> <p>See <a href=\"https://www.thekarllagerfeld.mo/en\" target=\"_blank\">thekarllagerfeld.mo/en</a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Wrenching Canadian comedy keeps a step ahead of our expectations',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><b>Sort Of (season 3) ★★★★½ <br/></b>Stan</p> <p>Now that its third and final season has arrived, it’s time to celebrate this sometimes wrenching Canadian comedy as one of the best, albeit consistently under-rated, series of the past few years. A show whose central character always felt a step behind in their own life, <i>Sort Of</i> is by contrast always a step ahead of audience expectations: emotionally genuine when melodrama would have been easier, wittily telling when farce would have sufficed. Weighed together, these succinct episodes carry more than anyone might have predicted.</p> <p>Set in Toronto, <i>Sort Of</i> was heralded on arrival for its firsts: co-creator Bilal Baig is queer, gender-fluid and Muslim, as is the character they play, Sabi Mehboob, the child of Pakistani immigrants coming to grips with who they want to be. But identity doesn’t lead to overt politics, instead Baig and co-creator Fab Filippo ground Sabi in intimacy. Sabi’s own steps in the first season are hesitant, but they are terrific as part-time nanny to a pair of children from a progressive household.</p> <p>The vicissitudes of family, whether in the form of blood relatives or those we choose to love, is a recurring focus on the show. Sabi’s various clans overlap so that there is a mutual attraction with the mother of their wards, Bessy (Grace Lynn Kung), even as Sabi has to contend with their increasingly exasperated sister, Aqsa (Supinder Wraich), before showing their true self to their mother, Raffo (Ellora Patnaik) in the first season, then their traditional father, Imran (Dhirendra), the following season.</p> <p>The third season finds Sabi still struggling with their relationships, but taking the decisive step of beginning hormone replacement therapy. One of the best qualities in this series is its refusal to accept a comfortable stasis: circumstance and realisation lead the characters forward. Sabi starts an impossibly hip business with their best friend, 7ven (Amanda Cordner), deals with questionable attractions, and finds a bond with Bessy’s husband, Paul (Gray Powell), the literal straight man in an enthusiastically transgender milieu.</p> <p>As writers, Baig and Filippo have a terrific touch: the children, for example, never play cute, but their queries have an unadorned, clarifying force, whether to Sabi or their parents. A single 22-minute episode might wrestle with unspoken trauma, offer some snippy anthropological insight from an unfiltered 7ven, a shot of sitcom silliness, and capture unexpected consolation. A cult success outside Canada, <i>Sort Of</i> is a model not just of screen diversity, but also how a deeply specific character can resonate in unexpected and immersive ways. This show will be missed.</p> <p><b>Mike Birbiglia: The Old Man and the Pool ★★★½ <br/></b>Netflix</p> <p>While this special has the familiar aesthetic of a stand-up gig, right down to the establishing shots of the audience filing into a theatre at New York’s Lincoln Centre, Mike Birbiglia is not a stand-up comedian. He’s a long-form storyteller who accumulates gags, a monologue artist who controls the flow of his performance with accomplished precision. Birbiglia doesn’t freelance from his script, or sputter with manic energy.</p> <p>It’s an approach that suits his observational style, which once again alights on the mysteries of his misbehaving body. When he fails a simple pulmonary test at his annual check-up, Birbiglia butts up against existential fears. He’s in his mid-40s and his father and paternal grandfather both died from heart attacks at age 56. “I think that might be a big year for me,” he notes, his signature wry self-deprecation surfacing.</p> <p>With short story-like digressions, such as a recounting of his failed high school wrestling career, the narrative follows Birbiglia’s quest to improve his health – the swimming pool is his doctor’s cardio suggestion – while communicating his concerns to his family and reappraising his childhood. Choice phrases are casually dropped, only to reappear with added profundity, and Birbiglia’s ease means that you don’t grow tired of his voice as the punchlines add up. There is, happily, plenty of life left in him yet.</p> <p><b>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters<br/></b>Apple TV+</p> <p>While this spin-off series has to accommodate a recent blockbuster revival of <i>Godzilla</i> movies, it does a good job of establishing its own identity as a youthful mystery set in 2015 as the world gets to grips with the emergence of giant creatures alternating with a 1950s backstory that sets up the mysterious organisation – Monarch – secretly researching them. The link is father and son Kurt and Wyatt Russell playing the same character in different eras, while the pay-off is the sizable digital effects budget that captures the vast scale of the many monsters.</p> <p><b>Plausible Deniability<br/></b>Facebook</p> <p>An independent Australian short-form comedy supported by Screen Australia and comprised of six 10-minute episodes, this barbed commentary on image-washing has a trio of 11-year-olds – played with instinctive timing by Naomi Ejigu, Mae White, and Lennox Lee – interviewing prominent figures for a school documentary about homelessness. Whether it’s a scandal-plagued footballer, social media influencer or church leader, the children’s straight questions soon expose the platitudes of their guests. Available via Facebook, Iain Crittenden’s satire has farcical rhythms and a knowing undertow: the young students don’t get what they expected, but they learn a great deal.</p> <p><b>Quiz Lady<br/></b>Disney+</p> <p>There’s a smart casting twist to this modestly enjoyable comedy about a pair of mismatched sisters thrown back together by their absent mother’s gambling debts: Sandra Oh plays against type as the unpredictable whirlwind Jenny, while Awkwafina is the stressed-out and straitlaced Anne. A circuitous plot has them looking for financial salvation (and a kidnapped dog) via the latter besting her nerves and going on her favourite quiz show, but Jessica Yu’s film is really an examination of the fractious sibling bond and the unexpected lines we hold family members to.</p> <p><b>Takeshi’s Castle<br/></b>Amazon Prime</p> <p>A cartoonish Japanese mix of <i>American Gladiators</i> and <i>It’s a Knockout</i>, this Japanese game show was a cultural oddity when first sighted in the 1980s – the late Clive James went on it as a contestant as part of a documentary about life in Japan. This loving reboot doesn’t feature much of original host Takeshi Kitano, who is better known internationally as a filmmaker and actor, but it’s full of giddy energy, wacky physical challenges, and deliberately cheap costumes.

Turns out, they do it all the time “as part of getting the audience mix right”, a spokesperson told us.</p> <p>We had other questions, too, like why did people in Brighton — where the median weekly income is nearly 1000 bucks higher than the state’s average, and which has three train stations — need help getting into the city?

       "   'headline': 'Think Biden is too old to run for president again? No, he’s feeling sprightly',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>There is growing expectation in Washington that, in coming weeks, President Joe Biden will announce that he will seek a second term in the White House.</p> <p>It is only because of Biden’s age that there has ever been any doubt about whether he would run again. The president turned 80 on November 20; were he to serve another term he would be 86 when he left office in January 2029. Yet, health permitting, there is no reason not to expect him to do so.</p> <p>Since the 22nd amendment to the US Constitution which imposes a two-term limit on the Presidency came into force in 1951, every incumbent American president has sought a second term. Six have been successful: Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, George W Bush and Obama. Four have failed: Ford, Carter, George H W Bush and Trump. Lyndon Johnson is difficult to classify: he was re-elected in 1964 having been in office for a year following the Kennedy assassination. Although ultimately he did not run again in 1968, he had every intention to do so, and only withdrew when he was pushed close to defeat in the New Hampshire primary. Kennedy himself made his fatal trip to Texas in November 1963 to lay the foundations for his re-election bid in 1964, which he would almost certainly have won.</p> <p>Nevertheless, no incumbent has been as old as Biden. Will his age make the difference? Subject, always, to the caveat of his health, I doubt it. In Australia, we are accustomed to the idea that even long political careers end in their 60s (if not earlier). Not so in the United States.</p> <p>When considering whether Biden would see his age as an impediment, it is instructive to consider the institution which shaped him: the US Senate. It was designed by the framers of the Constitution to be a body of wise elders (hence the Constitution prescribes a minimum age limit of 30). The etymology of the very word “Senate” is the Latin “senex” (old man). When Americans say “elder statesmen”, they really mean it. It is not uncommon for senators to serve into their 80s, in some cases their 90s.</p> <p>Among the senators elected in last year’s mid-terms was Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, commencing his eighth six-year term at the age of 89. (Grassley has served continuously in elected office, as a State legislator, Congressman and Senator since he was first elected to the Iowa House of Representatives in 1959.) Biden served in the Senate with Grassley for 28 years. His other former Senate colleagues included Orrin Hatch of Utah (who retired after 42 years at the age of 86), Ted Stevens of Alaska (who also served for 42 years until he reached 87), Daniel Inouye of Hawaii (who died in office in 2012 at the age of 88, a fortnight before his 50th anniversary), and Dianne Feinstein of California (incumbent, who turns 90 in June and has not ruled out running again in 2024). But the greatest of them all – at least in terms of longevity – was the legendary <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/champion-of-us-segregation-fathered-mixed-race-daughter-20031215-gdhzi0.html\" target=\"_blank\">Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who died in June 2003 at the age of 100</a>, having retired from the Senate only five months earlier after 48 years’ service. Thurmond began his public life in the South Carolina Senate in 1933; his continuous political service lasted one week short of 70 years.</p> <p>Had Biden not been tapped by Obama in 2008 to be his running-mate, he would very likely still be the senior senator for Delaware – and, like those and others of his senatorial colleagues, he would no doubt be planning to continue. Biden’s long service as a senator is key to understanding his future plans, because we are all shaped by the institutions in which we have our careers. In Biden’s case, it is the Senate, where age confers status, longevity enhances power, and being an octogenarian is no problem at all.</p> <p>Add to that the fact that politics is all Biden has ever done. He was first elected to the Senate half a century ago, in 1972. He was just 29; he was only constitutionally eligible because his 30th birthday fell between his election and the start of his term. He has been a senior political figure ever since. The only time in the last 50 years he has not held elected office was during the Trump presidency; during those four years he devoted himself full-time to running for president.</p> <p>Many US presidents come to the office having made their name outside politics: Wilson (university president), Eisenhower (general), Reagan (film star), the first Bush (businessman) and Trump (property developer and television “personality”). Quite a few have come to Washington from Governor’s mansions: FDR, Carter, Reagan, Clinton and the second Bush. Biden is not one of those. He has no interesting professional hinterland. His entire professional life has been spent as a Washington insider. Nor does he appear to have any interests outside politics: he is an entirely one-dimensional inside-the-Beltway politician.</p> <p>Historical precedent, institutional culture and life story aside, there is one other powerful reason why I expect Biden will decide to run again. He believes he can win. Should he decide to run, he is unlikely to face a primary challenger. Kamala Harris, foisted upon him by the Obamas and generally considered the least effective vice president since Dan Quayle, is no threat at all, nor is any other senior Democrat.</p> <p>With the nomination in the bag, he will face one of three scenarios: his opponent will either be Trump, a Trump surrogate, or a Republican who beats the Trump machine. If it is either of the first two, the mid-terms give Biden every reason to be confident of winning. If it is the latter, expect the MAGA Republicans to run a spoiler candidate to destroy the official nominee’s chances, just as George H W Bush’s re-election was derailed in 1992 by the insurgent campaign of Ross Perot.</p> <p>As he surveys the wreckage wrought upon the Republican Party by Donald Trump, Joe Biden must scarcely be able to believe his luck. And if ever, in a nostalgic moment, he casts his eye down Pennsylvania Avenue towards the institution which shaped him and in which he served for more than half his adult life, he must feel positively sprightly.</p> <p><strong>George Brandis was a Senator for Queensland from 2000 - 2018 and Leader of the Government in the Senate in the Turnbull Government.</strong></p> <p><b><i>The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own. </i></b><b><i>Sign up here</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p> <h3><b>More world commentary from our acclaimed writers</b></h3> <p><b>Weapons of choice:</b> We may not be at war, but Australia has some tough lessons to learn from Ukraine about what we need to prioritise and prepare in case we do go to war - <em>Mick Ryan</em></p> <p><b>The US/ Australia alliance:</b> There’s a new head of the US Studies Centre in Sydney, and this Republican has a few things he wants Australians to know about the reality of their relationship with the US - <em>Peter Hartcher</em></p> <p><b>Long term gain:</b> Recent headlines suggest that far-right populism is on the decline, but that would be short-sighted and dangerous to conclude.

       "   'headline': 'Hitchcock to Meryl Streep: The Hollywood history that’s full of juicy tales',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>In <em>Gigi</em>, Vincente Minnelli’s stylish 1958 musical, Honore (Maurice Chevalier) and former lover Madame Alvarez (Hermione Gingold) are reminiscing about the good old days. Cue: Lerner and Loewe’s witty<em> I Remember It Well</em>.</p> <p>Honore sings, “We met at nine.” “We met at eight,” Madame Alvarez corrects. “I was on time,” he continues. “No, you were late,” she responds. The song’s title is clearly ironic, and it’s surely no coincidence that, 16 years later, when Minnelli published his autobiography, largely about his time in Hollywood, he called it <em>I Remember It Well</em>. Acknowledging that maybe he didn’t.</p> <p>Sam Wasson and Jeanine Basinger’s 750-page oral history about Hollywood never directly addresses the question of how well those it cites might remember their time in Tinseltown. But it’s everywhere implicit: in the often contradictory viewpoints they offer about what it was, and is now, like; and in the way apocryphal anecdotes frequently sit side-by-side with much more plausible historical information.</p> <p>Veteran assistant director Ridgeway Callow delivers an amusing yarn about director Cecil B. DeMille, known for his serious approach to his work and for his autocratic dealings with extras for crowd scenes in big-budget films, from <em>King of Kings</em> (1927) to <em>The Ten Commandments</em> (1956).</p> <p>“One day, he caught an extra on set talking to her friend. ‘When I’m talking, young lady, what do you have to say that’s so important?’ The girl in question was a well-known extra by the name of Sugar Geise, an ex-showgirl and a great wit. Bravely, she spoke up. ‘I only said to my friend, When is that bald-headed son-of-a-bitch going to call lunch?’ There were a few apprehensive seconds of silence. Then Mr. DeMille yelled, ‘Lunch!’ So, he did have a sense of humour.”</p> <p>The story might be true, but Callow never worked with DeMille (and I can find no record of Geise ever having done so either), so it’s highly likely that he’s passing on an anecdote he’s heard from somebody else. Which might or might not be true, however much one wants it to be.</p> <p>Alongside it, <em>Hollywood</em> places the more reliable memories of some who did work with DeMille, including Charlton Heston, Edith Head and cinematographer Hal Rosson, as well as others who could speak with some authority about his standing in the film business, including fellow directors Allan Dwan, Tay Garnett and Mervyn LeRoy, and publicist Teete Carle.</p> <p><em>Hollywood: The Oral History</em> is full of often juicy and frequently informative stories about the place, mostly told by people who have worked there. It takes us from the era of the silents through to the present day, patiently guiding us across that very unsteady footbridge between the old Hollywood and the new one. And it’s an impressively ambitious endeavour, drawing creatively on the wonderful collection of material that came from the vaults of the American Film Institute.</p> <p>Wasson, the author of a handful of books about Hollywood – on Blake Edwards, Audrey Hepburn, Paul Mazursky, Bob Fosse, and <em>Chinatown</em> – had the original idea. He took it to Jeanine Basinger, his former lecturer in film studies at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, the author of a dozen books about the movies – their subjects include Shirley Temple, Gene Kelly, director Anthony Mann, the war movie and the musical – and a trustee at the AFI.</p> <p>With the institute’s approval, they gained access to 3000 guest speakers and nearly 10,000 hours of “intimate conversations between Hollywood professionals and AFI conservatory students”.</p> <p>These aren’t the kind of interviews people involved in the industry generally do when they’re trying to sell us something. They were exchanges in which they were able to speak freely and openly about their work, taking us behind the scenes to provide insights into the joys and the pitfalls that have been a daily part of their work and to what the late producer Joseph E. Levine delightfully refers to as the “<em>farkakte</em>” film business.</p> <p>Selected parts of these conversations are arranged more or less chronologically, Wasson recently telling <em>Vanity Fair</em>, “What we wanted to do was make it like a real conversation. So, we wanted it to be like Lillian Gish is in the room with Jordan Peele. And the way that we achieve that is by having people finish each other’s thoughts. It is one long conversation.”</p> <p>It was also a mammoth task to edit all the material together, although, curiously, the credits to the book have Wasson and Basinger as authors rather than editors. Along with a few other film commentators – critics, historians and journalists – they do make guest appearances from time to time. But it has to be said that we could generally have done without their interruptions. They add little to what we’re able to glean from what the speakers have already or are soon to say.</p> <p>The cast list is extensive. There are “old-timers” who have gone on ahead, such as directors Raoul Walsh, Frank Capra, Alfred Hitchcock, King Vidor, Billy Wilder, Rouben Mamoulian and John Cromwell, producers Henry Blanke, Pandro Berman and Arthur Freed, actors Henry Fonda, Gene Kelly, Bette Davis, cinematographers Stanley Cortez, Floyd Crosby and Hal Mohr, as well as many others.</p> <p>There’s also an abundance of comparatively new kids on the block, some of whom will need no introduction – Lucas, Spielberg, Beatty, Cameron, Scorsese, John Lasseter, JJ Abrams, Streep, Nicholson – and others who might, such as agent Michael Ovitz and producer Sherry Lansing. Two actors have their names misspelt (Margaret Sullavan and Joseph Cotten), and script continuity assistant Hannah Scheel (<em>Blow Out</em>) mysteriously appears to have become Hannah Sheeld, but these are minor blemishes.</p> <p>However, to claim that the book is <em>the</em> oral history is a bit over the top. There are thousands upon thousands of stories that aren’t told here, thousands of people who didn’t contribute to its history. And the puzzling editorial decision not to provide a detailed index or information about exactly where the participants sit in the epic saga of Hollywood results in an approximate history rather than a precise one.</p> <p>That said, though, the talk in <em>Hollywood</em> is often illuminating, consistently interesting and frequently entertaining. After all, these people all have one thing in common – they’re in show business. And I suspect that any reader who decides to dip into this hefty history will find it impossible not to want to read more … and then more.</p> <p><em><strong>Hollywood: The Oral History</strong></em><strong> by </strong><strong>Jeanine Basinger and Sam Wasson is published by </strong><strong>Faber &amp; Faber, $49.99.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

Accurate, but criminally inadequate.</p> <p>“Sly”, to use the nickname bestowed on him by a cop after Sylvester Stallone, <i>is</i> a columnist for <i>The Age</i>. He’s also a reporter, commentator, author, broadcaster, podcaster, expert witness, speaker, raconteur and humourist. His weekly <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/naked-city-jbi\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Naked City </i>articles</a>, which you’ll find on <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/naked-city-jbi\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Naked City </i>articles</a> at lunchtime Friday and in the newspaper on Saturday, are among the most compelling pieces of journalism you will read each week and provide a window into a part of society that most of us studiously avoid, but are endlessly fascinated by. His weekly appearances on 3AW as Sly of the Underworld are usually entertaining, occasionally poignant and always informative.</p> <p>No one has a finer record of covering crime, corruption and policing in this state than Silvester, who began on the beat in Melbourne in 1979.</p> <p>In the past 44 years he has seen and written about disturbing tragedies that have left scars on Melbourne, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Street bombing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Street bombing</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Street bombing</a>. Long after most reporters have closed their files, Sly is still writing about those incidents, and the people whose lives they changed, as they continue to reverberate through Melbourne.</p> <p>He has had plenty of run-ins with crooks such as the terrifying “Badness”, who renamed him “Slime of the Underworld” and heckled him in various letters. He has received morbid Christmas cards from – and written books with – the late Mark “Chopper” Read.</p> <p>During 44 years of reporting on Melbourne’s underbelly, Silvester has not lost a milligram of sensitivity, wit or ability. All three of those traits are on display <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/deadly-mushrooms-mysteries-and-the-curious-cops-20230810-p5dvin.html\" target=\"_blank\">in this week’s column</a>, published earlier today, in which he looks at the latest on the Gippsland mushroom mystery, without losing sight of the fact three people beloved by their community have died in tragic circumstances.</p> <p>Even though he’s apparently just “a columnist,” Silvester’s reporting instincts kicked in this week, as they often do. In tandem with <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/by/marta-pascual-juanola-h1ep4c\" target=\"_blank\">Marta Pascual Juanola</a>, our reporter on the ground, he has been chasing leads on this tragedy while police attempt to piece together exactly what happened.</p> <p>A Graham Perkin Journalist of the Year alumnus, Silvester has won more journalism awards than you could poke a concealed weapon at. He has written numerous books, his <a href=\"https://podcasts.theage.com.au/podcasts/naked-city/\" target=\"_blank\">Naked City podcast</a> is a must-listen series and plans for a new weekly Naked City newsletter are in the works. He has provided evidence at royal commissions and has more cops and robbers in his contact book than a prison warden.<b> </b></p> <p>But I have a few contacts of my own.

He joined on August 24, 1993.</p> <p>Three decades of such excellent reporting for <em>The Age</em> requires acknowledgement and thanks, which I readily offer. It should also prompt a moment of reflection as to the importance of this kind of public interest journalism.</p> <p><i>The Age</i> has a long history of impeccable reporting on crime and justice, of which you as our backers and supporters should be proud.

       "   'headline': 'The darkly comic enigma who gave Chandler Bing his perfect smile',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>As Chandler Bing on the iconic television sitcom <em>Friends</em>, the late Matthew Perry possessed a unique combination of charm and vulnerability. He was quick-witted – aside from co-star Lisa Kudrow, he was easily the razor-sharpest of the show’s six stars – but in his delivery he had a brittle quality. Chandler Bing, like Matthew Perry, wore his sensitivity on his sleeve.</p> <p>There was an enigmatic ridiculousness to Chandler’s persona. He worked in the indecipherable field of statistical analysis and data reconfiguration. His father Charles transitioned into the cabaret star Helena Handbasket. His parents divorced over Thanksgiving dinner, leaving him haunted by the holiday season. He met every moment with wide-eyed, darkly comical horror.</p> <p>But what gave Chandler Bing real life was Perry’s extraordinary presence. And a smile that beamed from cheek to cheek, which came with an added twinkle in his eyes. When Perry looked at you, he really saw you. His gaze was intense but almost unguarded. Unlike many stars, who meet the spotlight head on, Perry, like Chandler, was always a little ill at ease.</p> <p>It is a truism in comedy – television sitcom, in particular – that the line between actor and character is often blurred. It is not a great mystery, it is a byproduct of the brutality of high-turnover cultural commerce. There is little time for nuance in the business of weekly TV, so in many ways the writers’ room depends on the show casting actors who, more or less, are the characters they are going to play.</p> <p>Which is not to say that Perry and Chandler Bing were one and the same. Rather, in Chandler’s most vulnerable moments, and in the moments when television comedy strays into dark emotion, Perry’s own sensitivities were never far from the surface. The pace of the show depended on that. And Perry, with a greater dramatic range than a sitcom ever really tapped, always hit his mark.</p> <p>I met Perry several times: on the set of <em>Friends</em> in the mid-1990s, at the height of its popularity, and years later, when he was promoting the reboot of <em>The Odd Couple</em> in 2015. In some respects, the two Matthew Perrys were wholly different. On the set of <em>Friends</em>, he was playful and charming, barely an adult. Being interviewed for <em>The Odd Couple</em> two decades later, he was guarded, bruised by the bumpy road of fame that had followed.</p> <p>At the same time, the two men were not so different. Both were candid. And even as an older man, Perry did not seem to lose the qualities of his younger self, the smile, the twinkle in the eye; uncertain about what the spotlight expected of him, but willing to have an honest conversation. And he was no less funny at 45 than he was at 25.</p> <p>Even in the last few years of his life – when his addiction and health issues were more widely known, and tackled with great candour in his autobiography <em>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir</em> – his humour was always on display. An unwillingness to take himself too seriously, and an unwillingness to take the burden of fame too seriously, either.</p> <p>On the cultural landscape, there sit few great generational comedies. <em>I Love Lucy</em> is one. For the generation that came after that, <em>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</em> is another. For an audience of a certain age, <em>Friends</em> is a third. A culturally definitive comedy that gave every group of schoolmates, roommates or work colleagues who watched familiar roles to play, and punchlines and moments to hang onto.</p> <p>In that sense, Chandler Bing was everyone’s roommate or co-worker, a big brother to some, and an imaginary boyfriend to others. It is a reflection of both the power of popular culture in a media-saturated world, and also the uniquely intimate properties of television, which brings fictional universes into our homes and hearts every day.</p> <p>For that reason, Perry’s death cuts deep. It momentarily silences the laughter. And it momentarily takes us into feelings of grief and loss. It seems almost absurd to feel so deeply the loss of a fictional character as much as the man who played him. But that is the oddness of television too; it creates inexplicable connections between the real and the imaginary.</p> <p>The world of <em>Friends</em> endures as a byproduct of another one of television’s quirks: the rerun. A total of 236 half-hour episodes, across 10 seasons. Wherever you go, whenever you switch on a TV, a local channel will be playing an episode. Streaming platforms will offer it on demand. The more fastidious will keep the DVDs on their shelves.</p> <p>What we find there is an extraordinary tapestry of great characters, beautifully written moments and nuances of performance that have turned Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, Monica, Joey and Rachel into mononyms. Like Oprah and Madonna, they are people – admittedly made-up ones – who endure in our conversations with a singular name.</p> <p>And within the rectangular frame of the television screen, Matthew Perry will endure, gifted a strange kind of immortality. Rendered in pixels, and replaying much-loved moments from our shared cultural memory, we may have lost the flesh-and-blood man, but his absurd and delightful alter ego, the uncertain duplicate that is Chandler Bing, will live forever.</p> <p><em><strong>Get the day’s breaking news, entertainment ideas and a long read to enjoy.

       "   'description': '<p>When it comes to the Academy Awards, it’s important to be honest. Brutally so. We understand that now thanks to brutally honest ballots like <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/brutally-honest-oscars-ballot-4-1235117325/\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>, wherein an Academy member reveals who and what they voted for while absolutely slamming the other nominees. We get a treasured glimpse into Oscars voting considerations along with an acute awareness that, as with most people, the Academy members have terrible taste in movies.</p> <p>I’ve been reading these mostly incomprehensible opinions for years and decided that I wanted in on the action. Of course, I am not technically a member of the Academy, so my “ballot”, such as it is, is not legal. As with the American presidential election, my vote doesn’t count.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I am voting – and I absolutely refuse to hold back. It’s important to be brutally honest. It’s <i>courageous</i>. I don’t have time to worry about the online regressive progressive left-right up-down mob swinging their cancel culture pitchforks and their sensitivity training torches.</p> <p>Because movies matter.</p> <h3>Best Picture</h3> <p>How’s this for honesty: 10 Best Picture nominees is too many movies. Make us choose between two. That’s it.</p> <p>Otherwise, I really enjoyed <i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i>. Very entertaining. I took <i>Avatar: The Way of Water</i> as a personal attack, as if James Cameron was trying to make fun of me somehow.</p> <p><i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> was, paradoxically, one of the noisiest movies I’ve ever seen. At 158 minutes, <i>Tar</i> was far too short. I needed another two or three hours to really get a feel for the character.</p> <p>While I’m being so brutally honest, I should mention that on several occasions, I have told people that I had COVID-19 so I wouldn’t have to hang out with them.</p> <p>VOTE: <i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i></p> <h3>Best Director</h3> <p>A lot of people don’t know this, but the “director” of a movie is usually the least useful person on a set. They literally just bumble around, forgetting people’s names and breaking expensive equipment. Especially if the director is Steven Spielberg. Or so I hear.</p> <p>Also, I promised my wife I was going to learn CPR but I haven’t done it. I’ve got the instructional DVD, but I just haven’t gotten around to watching it. The box has been sitting on a shelf for 11 years. Thankfully, in that time, no one near me has required resuscitation, or we’d all have been in big trouble.</p> <p>VOTE: Ruben Ostlund (<i>Triangle of Sadness</i>)</p> <h3>Best Actor</h3> <p>I don’t officially recognise movies with fat suits in them. So, thanks to <i>Elvis</i> and <i>The Whale</i>, this whole category is disqualified.</p> <p>In university, I once sang along to <em>Total Eclipse of the Heart</em> so loudly in my dorm room that people became worried about me. Reports were filed. It was a particularly emotional time and I found a lot of comfort in Bonnie Tyler’s soaring vocals…</p> <p><i>“Turn around…”</i></p> <p>VOTE: Paul Mescal (<i>Aftersun</i>)</p> <h3>Best Actress</h3> <p>Andrea Riseborough controversially enlisted the help of famous friends to lobby for her nomination in the supposedly underwhelming <i>To Leslie</i>. But the real dirty secret is that <i>To Leslie</i> is the best movie of the last 50 years.</p> <p>Also, I have eaten an entire log of pre-made chocolate chip cookie dough in one sitting.</p> <p>And when I say “sitting”, I don’t mean “sitting”, because I was standing. In front of the fridge. And when I say “standing”, I mean “hunched”. And when I say “in front of”, I mean “inside”.</p> <p>VOTE: Michelle Yeoh (<i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i>)</p> <h3>Best Supporting Actor</h3> <p>I have been a tremendous Judd Hirsch (<i>The Fabelmans</i>) stan since he played Saul in <i>Fear on Trial</i> in 1975. He is a master and Brendan Gleeson (<i>The Banshees of Inisherin</i>) has been ripping off his acting style for decades.</p> <p>I’ve been telling people that I meditate but I don’t.</p> <p>During lockdown, I tried to develop the practice, but it didn’t take. And yet I maintained the facade. Why? I guess I want (need?) the respect and admiration of strangers. And I guess I don’t want to admit that deep down, I’m probably a little bit of a quitter.</p> <p>Wow. That one stung. This is not easy.</p> <p>VOTE: Ke Huy Quan (<i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i>)</p> <h3>Best Supporting Actress</h3> <p>Brutally Honest Confession #1: Kerry Condon (<i>The Banshees of Inisherin</i>) hasn’t made a good movie since <i>How Harry Became a Tree</i> in 2001.</p> <p>Brutally Honest Confession #2: I am not 100 per cent sure who Kerry Condon is.</p> <p>Brutally Honest Confession #3: During a regrettable two-week stay at a summer camp when I was 12, I ran into someone who’d bullied me in school. When he said I looked familiar, I pretended not to understand or speak English. I was just a boy and I was afraid.</p> <p>There’s more:</p> <p>Whenever my wife asks me how far away I am, I always say “15 minutes”.</p> <p>Whether I’m half an hour away or two hours, my answer is always the same. I can be in my pyjamas, still in bed, trapped under something heavy and I will always say that I’m just 15 minutes away. I’m in the car. (I’m not.) I’m coming around the corner, I can see you. (I can’t.) I’m parked right in front of you, don’t you see me? (I’m not, she can’t.) It’s obviously not a great system but I don’t know how to stop.</p> <p>I frequently pretend to be friends with Martin Scorsese.</p> <p>I say that he’s a family friend from New York and I grew up going to his house and that I gave him the idea for <i>Goodfellas</i>. I say that I used to call him Uncle Marty and he called me Nicky Little Shoes and that he bought me my first fedora and we still go to Disney World every year.</p> <p>I’m sorry, just a few bullet points I wanted to make sure I covered…</p> <ul><li>I keep a World War II Documentary Diary.

       "   'description': '<p>For television historians amateur and professional, the easiest place to begin the story of the contemporary Golden Age of Television is on January 10, 1999, when Tony Soprano first paid a toll on the New Jersey Turnpike. But perhaps we might be better served to rewind the clock approximately six years, to January 31, 1993, the premiere of a new NBC drama, set in Baltimore, studying the work of the city’s homicide detectives.</p> <p>The series was called <em>Homicide: Life on the Street</em>, and it was based on a book by David Simon, then a Baltimore <em>Sun</em> reporter who had spent a year tagging along with the police department’s homicide squad. <em>Homicide</em> was never a ratings success, but it stayed on the air for seven seasons, winning four Emmys and three Peabody Awards. The show was prickly, funny, morally forceful, endlessly discursive and filled with a murderers’ row of actors, including future stars Andre Braugher (who won an Emmy for his performance as Frank Pembleton), Melissa Leo and Giancarlo Esposito, along with veterans like Ned Beatty, Yaphet Kotto and Richard Belzer, known primarily then as a stand-up comedian.</p> <p>The show’s sixth episode, <em>Three Men and Adena</em>, which first aired in March, was a stark, dramatic example of what made <em>Homicide</em> different from other cop shows. It takes place almost entirely within the confines of an interrogation room, with detectives Pembleton and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) attempting to wring a confession out of Risley Tucker (Moses Gunn), an itinerant fruit-and-vegetable man, after the murder of a little girl named Adena Watson. Pembleton and Bayliss prod, provoke and rage, but <em>Homicide</em> refuses to grant the audience the resolution they crave. Tucker doesn’t crack. Adena’s case is never solved. (The showrunner, Tom Fontana, won an Emmy for writing the episode.)</p> <p>Thirty years later, Fontana, executive producers Barry Levinson and Paul Attanasio and actors Braugher and Secor reflected on <em>Three Men and Adena</em>, in particular, and on the broader legacy of the series and their frustration at its still not being available to stream. These are edited excerpts from conversations with them.</p> <p>After Levinson, a Baltimore native known for setting films like <em>Diner</em> and <em>Avalon</em> in the city, read Simon’s book, he knew he wanted to adapt it. But he thought TV would be a better venue. He hired Attanasio to create the series and write the pilot, and he eventually brought in Fontana to run the show.</p> <p>TOM FONTANA: I said, “I’m not really sure I want to do a cop show.” And Levinson said: “This is about the homicide detectives. They’re thinking cops. There’s no gunbattles, there’s no car chases.” And I said: “That’s impossible. I’ll do it.”</p> <p>BARRY LEVINSON: I thought it ought to be done completely in Baltimore. We can do it really down and dirty and lean. Instead of shooting 35-millimeter film, we’ll shoot in Super 16 and with hand-held cameras.</p> <p>FONTANA: I think I’ve read David’s book more times than I’ve read any other book in my life. By the time we were done, we’d used everything in the book, including the commas and question marks.</p> <p>PAUL ATTANASIO: I built Frank Pembleton out of the idea of a character who didn’t want a partner. And then Kyle’s character, Bayliss, was a more functional, more conventional television character who was the rookie, so you could use him as a guide to bring you into the show.</p> <p>FONTANA: Our premiere was after the Super Bowl. NBC was very jazzed about that. I said to Barry: “After the Super Bowl, everybody’s drunk! This isn’t a show you can watch drunk.”</p> <p>ANDRE BRAUGHER: The first year, there was a sort of Jean-Luc Godard jump-cut sensibility that we enjoyed.</p> <p>FONTANA: I said to Barry, “You know, I’d love to write an episode that basically only takes place in the interrogation room.” And he said: “Let’s just try it. Let’s try everything.”</p> <p>KYLE SECOR: I went in and met them. Within a couple minutes, they said, “The sixth episode we’re going to do, it’s just going to be three guys in an interrogation room. It’ll be you, your partner and this other character.” And I went, “Oh, well, I’m in.”</p> <p>FONTANA: The real girl who was murdered in Baltimore, that the Adena Watson story was based on, her murder was never solved. I made a decision that we would never solve the murder on the show because we felt like it would be disrespectful to the family and to the young girl’s memory.</p> <p>SECOR: We had rehearsals before shooting, which was a comfort. Andre and I had spent a lot of time in that room, and it felt like that was our room. We had control of that room.</p> <p>BRAUGHER: We performed it like a theatre piece. There’s nowhere to go. It’s a strangely shaped little room with a door and a window. So it’s just three men going around and around and around again.</p> <p>FONTANA: We are asking the audience to watch this hour of intense interrogation and then not give them the solution they were hoping for. That was satisfying for me as well, because I didn’t want it to be all neat and tidy at the end.</p> <p>ATTANASIO: I think what’s really brilliant about that script is, it’s one thing to say you’re not to give the audience what they’re looking for. But then the question is, what are you going to give them? And what Tom gave them was heartbreak. And irresolution.</p> <p>FONTANA: I knew the rhythms of Andre and Secor. And I knew that it had to have twists and turns, and that eventually, Tucker would start indicting them. I knew going in that was the way it would travel.</p> <p>ATTANASIO: It’s not just good like bran cereal is good for you. It’s electrifying. You can’t take your eyes off it. And all it is, is three actors in a room.</p> <p>BRAUGHER: It’s the most fun I’ve had filming an episode. It was physically hard, it was emotionally taxing, but it was very satisfying.</p> <p>At the end of the episode, Bayliss takes the photograph of Adena from the interrogation room and places it on his desk, where it remains for multiple seasons.</p> <p>SECOR: When I met Tom Pellegrini, who was the detective that I was based on, I got Bayliss immediately as someone where being unable to solve this case affected his entire life. Affected his marriage, affected relationships, affected his job, affected how he saw his work, everything.</p> <p>FONTANA: If you’re going to track a character over the life of a series, you need to see the stuff that he or she accumulates. There was an episode where he puts the picture in a drawer. He was sort of like, “I have to get past this now.”</p> <p>BRAUGHER: That’s one of the beautiful things about the episode. It doesn’t resolve in favour of our heroes. The moral frustration in the entire series is that Adena Watson’s murder is never solved.</p> <p>FONTANA: My career has been an endless number of shows that I’m proud of that never were in the Top 10, starting with <em>St. Elsewhere</em>.</p> <p>ATTANASIO: Don Ohlmeyer (then NBC’s West Coast president) loved the show, as long as they could make it for a reasonable amount of money.</p> <p>BRAUGHER: When I think back to that initial group, that first- and second-year group, it was a wonderful cast and boy, were we quirky. Boy, were we misfits, and I loved it.</p> <p>LEVINSON: For the last four years, I’ve tried to get an answer for why we’re not on streaming. No one, I mean no one, has been able to give me an answer. There’s money to be made. You can’t figure out how to handle whatever rights issues that may come up? You’re talking over 120-some[thing] episodes. And somehow no one can figure out how to handle the rights? That doesn’t make sense!</p> <p>SECOR: Who knows? Maybe we’ll start streaming on Netflix!</p> <p>This article originally appeared in The New York Times.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/arts/television/homicide-life-on-the-street.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><b>Silo ★★★★<br/></b>Apple TV+, Friday</p> <p>A worthy mystery needs a suitable detective to unravel it and one the many impressive elements of this science-fiction puzzle is that has a succession of them. Set in a self-contained underground city, hundreds of floors deep but shallow in answers, <i>Silo</i> creates a thread of inquisitors: some official and some unlikely, some obsessed and some scared to ask. The way the story passes along their enquiry, with intimacy and genuine understanding, helps make this series resonate in valuable and unforeseen ways.</p> <p>The titular structure is a society of approximately 10,000 people, organised for mutual survival in the face of a post-apocalyptic landscape above their heads; the city’s death sentence is to be sent outside. It’s a strange new world and those who want answers to the existential questions have to overcome the communal belief in sticking together, whether it’s IT clerk Allison (Rashida Jones), her sheriff husband Holston (David Oyelowo), and finally, a generator engineer, Juliette (Rebecca Ferguson). Each illuminates the mystery differently.</p> <p>The drama was adapted from the Steve Howey’s series of novels by Graham Yost (<i>Justified</i>), who with lead director Morten Tyldum (<i>The Imitation Game</i>) creates an engrossing world that naturally reveals the lives and limits of the population. Staircases link the Silo – no elevators – and porters run up and down constantly in the background, another noteworthy detail alongside the darned clothes, worn infrastructure, and worrying tilt towards authoritarianism in the name of safety. You pick up traditions, baffling rules, and slang.</p> <p>With her hum of unease and a seditious tilt of her head, <i>Mission: Impossible</i> and <i>Dune</i> star Ferguson is a compelling, unpredictable investigator – a loner who can fix broken objects but not herself. Because she’s from the working-class bottom of the city, the “down deep”, her ventures into the “up top” mark her as an outsider. The big questions – who built the silo? Why is there no record of what happened outside? – percolate throughout, but the writing doesn’t grind them out.</p> <p>One episode is mostly dedicated to a crucial maintenance mission, told with ticking clock tension. It’s indicative of the astute storytelling that underpins this vertical <i>Snowpiercer</i>. Life for the most part goes on in the city even as the search for answers becomes ever more intense – this is a long tail narrative, confident enough to give audiences a little insight early on and then let navigate the sharp turns. It’s an elegant, immersive puzzle, but also an exploration of the mutual obligations that hold every society together.</p> <p><b>Bupkis ★★★½ <br/></b>Binge</p> <p>29-years-old sounds young to be making an autobiographical series, but it turns out that Pete Davidson – the <i>Saturday Night Live</i> comic and former boyfriend of Ariana Grande and Kim Kardashian – has plenty to say about himself. In fact, perhaps too much. These 25-minute slices of life about a barely fictionalised Pete Davidson are equal parts celebrity explainer and therapy session, absurdist comedy and earnest dedication.</p> <p>Co-created by Davidson, <i>Bupkis</i> mirrors his life, from living in his mother’s basement to losing firefighter father on 9/11, although his screen mother is played by Edie Falco with Joe Pesci as his ailing grandfather. Davidson is self-deprecating but vulnerable. He’s trying to figure himself out on screen. The second episode, a childhood flashback to his aunt’s wedding with Bobby Cannavale as the groom, is bittersweet but somewhat baffling.</p> <p>There are trace elements of <i>Atlanta</i> here, alongside celebrity cameos including an Al Gore and Jon Stewart two-hander, and in a way Davidson is auditioning the audience: are you willing to encompass all the sides of me that I struggle with? There’s a certain arrogance in that, but even with the considerable advice dispensed and latent self-obsession, Pete Davidson and <i>Bupkis</i> grow on you.</p> <p><b>Citadel<br/></b>Amazon Prime</p> <p>It may have a Jason Bourne joke, but as reportedly one of the most expensive television shows ever made this spy action-thriller wants to be Bond, Bourne, and beyond. The flaky globe-trotting narrative has Priyanka Chopra Jonas (<i>Quantico</i>) and Richard Madden (<i>Bodyguard</i>) as elite private agents fighting a nefarious organisation to stay alive. The show – in just six episodes – is trying to include everything: massive set-pieces, steamy romance, breathless fun, and save the world angst. The plotting is fantastical, and the leads solid, but the series struggles to rise above the piecemeal.</p> <p><b>Secrets of the Elephants<br/></b>Disney+</p> <p>Narrated by Natalie Portman with pachyderm expert Dr Paula Kahumbu as the audience’s guide, this four-part National Geographic documentary series is a detailed journey into the family life, difficult conditions, and demanding treks that form the life of desert elephants in the African country of Namibia. The production values and breadth of footage is first-rate, with the show taking the time to establish the hardy rhythms and necessary demands of the creature’s lives. It’s welcome family viewing, but thankfully it’s mostly without treacly sentiment or goofy interludes.</p> <p><b>Queenmaker<br/></b>Netflix</p> <p>A super-charged <i>Scandal</i> set in South Korea, this close to unhinged political drama follows the unlikely alliance between a lawyer who advocates for the vulnerable, Oh Kyung-sook (Moon So-ri) and the Machiavellian fixer for ruthless family conglomerate, Hwang Do-hee (Kim Hee-ae). When the latter has a crisis of conscience, she recruits the former to run as Seoul’s mayor against the nepo baby son of her former boss. The storytelling is expansive and the pacing variable, but the tricks of the fixer trade are highly watchable and the eventual friendship between the two women is genuinely forged.</p> <p><b>Blindspotting (season 2)<br/></b>Stan</p> <p>The first season of this American comedy-drama about the idiosyncratic bonds and unexpected of a modern blended family – Ashley (Jasmin Cephas-Jones) and her young son have to move in with mother-in-law, Rainey (Helen Hunt), after her partner, Miles (Rafael Casals), is incarcerated – went under the radar. Set in Oakland, it’s a timely show about race, class, and family, with the new season continuing to mix raucous humour with hard-won insight. The characters are trying to grow, to do better, but progress is easily derailed. The show never preaches.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Why Stephen Sondheim is one of the all-time great writers',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>It’s official: Stephen Sondheim is the all-time greatest writer of musicals. OK, this is from a straw poll of only two people, but the pair in question, performer and director Nancye Hayes and director Stuart Maunder, are musical theatre royalty.</p> <p>Suggest that Sondheim was the only creator of musicals to hold a candle to such playwrights as Tennessee Williams in terms of complex characterisations and there’s more furious agreement. As there is for the idea that, with his rhymes a match for Byron or Pope, his work was not just at the pinnacle of theatre, but of writing, period.</p> <p>And then there’s his music.</p> <p>This year seems to be Sydney’s unofficial Stephen Sondheim year, with three of his shows being staged: <em>Into the Woods</em> at Belvoir in March, the Maunder-directed <em>Sweeney Todd</em> about to open at the Opera House and <em>A Little Night Music</em>, starring Hayes, arriving in October at the theatre bearing her name 50 years after it premiered on Broadway.</p> <p>Maunder, among our most acclaimed directors of both musicals and opera, describes <em>Sweeney Todd – </em>the gothic tale of a barber with a taste for unusually close shaves, and of Mrs Lovett, a pie-maker with a taste for baking his victims – as a “bizarre hybrid”.</p> <p>“It has conquered the operatic stages of the world as well as the theatre stages,” he says. “Sondheim famously called the piece a thriller because it’s an opera if it’s in an opera house, and it’s a play if it’s in a playhouse. So in a way, he’s created his own genre.”</p> <p>This may not have been so obvious when Maunder once directed a children’s production of the show (which seems rather close to having kids do <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>), but now with Antoinette Halloran as Mrs Lovett and Ben Mingay as Todd, he finds a complexity in the relationship between the leads that he thinks many productions have obscured.</p> <p>“There’s a real – if strange – love story there that needs to be teased out,” he says.</p> <p>For Maunder, the only musical by Sondheim – “the 20th century’s great songwriter” – to rival <em>Sweeney</em> is <em>A Little Night Music</em>, which he’s directed four times (including twice with Hayes playing Madame Armfeldt).</p> <p>He especially admires how directors can approach the show from different angles.</p> <p>“It’s an incredibly truthful, beautiful piece of work,” he says. “It’s just so honest when these two people, Desiree and Fredrik, come together at the end, and they sit on a bed, and she sings <em>Send in the Clowns </em>… It’s that problem that we all face of finding different people at different times in our lives, and making choices that end up being disastrous for us.”</p> <p>He also enthuses about <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>, Sondheim’s explosively imaginative piece about the creative process, and <em>Into the Woods</em>, which he calls “the hardest show in the world to direct” because it has so many principals.</p> <p>“They’re masterful in their conception, and you alter these pieces at your peril because they are so beautifully honed,” he says.</p> <p>Hayes’ performances have been honed across countless productions – she’s starred in more Australian premieres of major musicals than she can count. Maunder first worked with her in 2008 when she played what he calls “the most acerbic, charming, funny Mrs Higgins” in his Opera Australia production of <em>My Fair Lady</em>.</p> <p>Since then, they’ve collaborated on <em>Night Music</em> and <em>Sunday in the Park</em>, and he has boundless admiration for her “ability to go straight to the truth of a moment”.</p> <p>Hayes says choosing a favourite Sondheim show is as hard as “naming your favourite child”, but that playing Mrs Lovett in <em>Sweeney </em>is a strong contender.</p> <p>She first encountered Sondheim in the flesh when he came here with director Hal Prince and lyricist Alan Jay Lerner in 1977 for a theatre forum at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.</p> <p>“He said he was working on a musical based on a play he’d seen in London about the demon barber of Fleet Street,” she recounts. “He was actually starting work on that!”</p> <p>Then she saw the original Broadway <em>Sweeney</em> (with Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou). “And it just blew me away,” she says. “It was late 1979, and I couldn’t wait to get back to the hotel and ring someone to tell them how extraordinary it was, but it was the middle of the night in Australia, and it was very frustrating!”</p> <p>In October Hayes plays Madame Armfeldt again, this time with Dean Bryant directing, and she’s looking forward to the new take he’ll have on <em>Night Music</em>, given the theatre’s constraints.</p> <p>As Madame Armfeldt she sings the fabulous <em>Liaisons</em>, crammed with the wry observations of a woman who’s seen it all, including that we mere mortals muddle sex with desire. Hayes especially loves the lines: “Take my daughter, I taught her, I tried my best to point the way. I even named her Desiree.”</p> <p>She says performing Sondheim’s work is not easy, “but it’s enormously rewarding if you get it right – for both yourself and an audience”.</p> <p>For Hayes, getting it right these days also includes overcoming nerves. “I think the more you do, the worse it gets,” she observes. “There’s so much more you expect of yourself because you feel it’s expected of <em>you</em>. When you’re young, and you’re just loving every second of it, it carries you through.”</p> <p>Then there’s the added pressure of playing in a theatre named after her. “Yes, it is a bit daunting,” she admits.</p> <p>But ultimately, she still relishes being part of a company, and each performance being a fresh chance to give her best.</p> <p>When she became friends with Hal Prince, they’d dine together when she was in New York, sometimes joined by Sondheim. “A shy man,” she recalls. “He probably preferred to be back working on something.”</p> <p><strong><em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street </em>is at the Opera House Drama Theatre from July 22 to August 27. <em>A Little Night Music</em> is at Hayes Theatre from October 13 to November 11.</strong></p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Lost its mojo? No way. Ted Lasso is still the sweetest show on TV',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>There’s been a lot of talk about <em>Ted Lasso</em>. Speculation that the just-concluded third season will be its last. Narrow assessments and lofty dismissals propose that, whatever its future, the soccer-club comedy had lost its mojo anyway; so no great loss. Regretful pronouncements judge that the long-awaited 2023 season didn’t exhibit the disarming magic that had made the series a global hit and an awards-show darling. Its sunny spirit, kind heart and sweet optimism arrived like the ideal tonic for dark and scary pandemic times.</p> <p>The London-based comedy sees co-creator, co-writer and co-producer Jason Sudeikis playing the title character, a preternaturally compassionate fish-out-of-water coach from America’s Midwest struggling with a foreign sporting code and a marriage breakdown when he’s employed to revive a struggling English soccer team.</p> <p>At the time of writing, Apple TV+ hadn’t confirmed or denied the end of Ted and its coyness is perhaps understandable. There might be uncertainty from the creative team about if and how to proceed. There could be reluctance from a multinational corporation to bid a final farewell to one of its standout successes, even though the series was originally conceived with a three-season arc.</p> <p>Of course, things can change. Supply can respond to demand. Acclaim, awards and viewer enthusiasm might motivate a desire to carry on and not kill the golden goose. Or a rethink could result in some shapeshifting: Ted goes on, but not as we know it. Describing the audience wanting more as “flattering”, Sudeikis recently remarked to <em>Deadline</em>, perhaps as a throwaway, that he could appear on Cameo, the website where fans can request personalised videos from their favourite actors.</p> <p>Then there’s the spin-off route, where one of the characters is plucked from the pack and becomes the star of his or her own sequel. Certainly, there are enough candidates in this vibrant ensemble to inspire ideas about the possibilities: think of, say, Keeping Up With Keeley, Uncle Roy, or At Home With Higgins. However, the attempt to again catch lightning in a bottle is a demonstrably risky road: for every fabulous <em>Frasier</em>, there are a dozen unfortunate <em>Joey</em>s.</p> <p>While the future is uncertain, the question of quality is easier to address as <em>Ted Lasso</em> clearly became a victim of its own success. Initially ecstatically embraced, it was showered with love, praise and prizes. In a way, the only direction it could go from such heights was down to disappointment. But by way of response to the criticism that it’s not what it once was, that the third season has been bloated and static and that the show has lost its spark: oh, phooey.</p> <p>True, it no longer has the advantage of being a novelty. Now, to some extent, we know what to expect, and the third season has been rich in familiar pleasures. Sweet-natured without being syrupy, it’s reinforced the production’s basic tenets, to do with the value of family and community, and the importance of tolerance, second chances and forgiveness.</p> <p>But, in spite of viewers’ knowing the comedy’s DNA, it’s retained a capacity to surprise and delight. That’s neatly illustrated by the Amsterdam episode featuring an unplanned yet blissful night on a houseboat for Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham), bicycle adventures for Roy (Brett Goldstein) and Jamie (Phil Dunster), a jazz-club visit for Leslie (Jeremy Swift) and Will (Charlie Hiscock), and some unexpected bonding for Colin (Billy Harris) and Trent (James Lance). All that as well as nifty references to <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> and <em>Almost Famous</em>. Beautiful.</p> <p>Through the seasons, with a light touch and thoughtful intelligence, the series has also tackled some tough stuff, examining anxiety, the aftermath of divorce and the damaging impact for men of concealing or repressing their emotions. This season also addresses issues of privacy and online hacking; coming out as gay; the toxicity of social media; and racism.</p> <p>One of the criticisms recently levelled at the show is that the title character is less interesting than those surrounding him. Even if that is the case – and it’s debatable – who cares? In some ways, that’s a sign of a great ensemble. As if testifying to the strength of its cast, at the 2021 Emmy Awards, four of the nominees in the Outstanding Supporting Actor category came from the show (Goldstein won). In 2022, <em>Ted Lasso</em> had three nominations in the Outstanding Actor and Outstanding Supporting Actress categories.</p> <p>Through the latest season, Keeley (Juno Temple) has again shone as a beacon of effervescence; Roy has continued to elevate grunting, scowling and swearing to the level of magnificence; Dani (Cristo Fernandez) and Sam (Toheeb Jimoh) have remained a joy. With Barbara (Katy Wix), the rain cloud of a CFO at Keeley’s PR firm, an Eeyore of a character became an understated treasure.</p> <p>And the trajectory chosen for kit-man-turned “Wonder Kid” Nathan (Nick Mohammed), who betrayed Ted, rewarding his mentor’s support with treachery, has been true to the series’ principles and logic. Instead of punishing or humiliating him, relishing in his comeuppance, Nate gets what he thought he wanted, discovers how hollow his ambitions were, and tries to make amends for his bad behaviour.</p> <p>Whatever happens from here, <em>Ted Lasso</em> has for three sparkling seasons championed kindness and compassion without getting mushy. It’s made us laugh and cry with clever comedy that’s blessed with wit and a gift for goofiness. It’s given us vibrant characters to care about and hope to see more of.

       "   'headline': 'The famous friends who saved Wilco singer after a 15-metre fall',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>Jeff Tweedy was bruised and shaken after taking a 15-metre fall down the side of a cliff. When he looked up, comedian Nick Offerman and author George Saunders were looking down at him with concern on their faces.</p> <p>No, this wasn’t a dream. This actually happened four years ago on a five-day hike in Glacier National Park in Montana, when the Wilco frontman slipped on melting ice.</p> <p>Yes, Tweedy is “pals”, as he puts it, with the star of <em>Parks And Recreation</em> and the Booker Prize-winning writer.</p> <p>“I met Nick when I appeared on <em>Parks And Rec</em>,” says Tweedy, reclining on a couch in his basement in Chicago after a day of rehearsals with Wilco for their upcoming world tour, a cat-shaped pillow behind his head and a collection of his late father’s electronic gadgets lining the shelves.</p> <p>“Apparently the conversation in the writers’ room went something like, ‘We need to find an ageing, washed-up rock star.’ And someone else said, ‘someone like Jeff Tweedy?’ And someone else said, ′Well, why don’t we just ask Jeff Tweedy?’”</p> <p>Offerman interviewed Tweedy and Saunders separately for his book <em>Gumption</em>, about 21 Americans who had shaped his world. Tweedy met Saunders when the two appeared on the final episode of <em>The Colbert Report</em>, along with a rollcall of over 100 guests that included Cookie Monster, Willie Nelson, Cyndi Lauper, George Lucas and Henry Kissinger.</p> <p>“George is one of my favourite authors, so I went searching for him backstage,” recalls Tweedy. “I saw him come out of the door of one of the dressing rooms and I said, ‘You’re the person I’m most excited to meet here.’ And he said, ‘Well, I was just coming to find you.’ It was very romantic.”</p> <p>Saunders told Tweedy he had listened to the sprawling Wilco song <em>One Sunday Morning (Song For Jane Smiley’s Boyfriend)</em> over and over every day while writing some of the stories in his collection <em>Tenth Of December</em>.</p> <p>He went on to write a piece about the song for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> in 2016, calling it “a reliable 12-minute prayer” and calling Tweedy “one of the great conversational poets of our time.”</p> <p>It wasn’t long before “a three-way bromance” (Offerman’s words in an interview with Stephen Colbert) was instigated, starting with long text threads between the trio, and culminating in the hike, which made its way into Offerman’s latest book, <em>Where The Deer And The Antelope Play</em>.</p> <p>Tweedy himself is also on a roll in the book-writing department. He has already published two – the 2018 memoir <em>Let’s Go (So We Can Get Back)</em> and 2020’s <em>How To Write One Song.</em><em></em></p> <p>The latter is a revealing and generous book about the creative process and why he thinks everyone should do it. He writes about pushing your ego out of the way and creating for the sake of creativity, and the feeling of disappearing when you’re truly in the moment.</p> <p>I point out that people also use drugs to disappear. Tweedy, 56, used to be addicted to prescription opiates he took for crippling migraines. How did things change for him creatively when he got sober 19 years ago?</p> <p>“It would be more accurate to say that I created those older songs in spite of being an addict,” he says. “Those issues I had were a distraction and sapped my energy, but the part of myself I was writing from was the part that was there before I did drugs. It was the part of me that was childlike and wanted a song to sing. That was the big revelation for me when I got sober. And that’s why I can still sing those songs and not feel like they were written by a different person.“</p> <p>Wilco are a self-sufficient band with their own studio, The Loft. But for the latest Wilco album, <em>Cousin</em>, they invited Welsh singer-songwriter Cate Le Bon to produce.</p> <p>“I met Cate when she played Solid Sound (the Massachusetts festival Tweedy curates) in 2019,” he says. “We performed an Arthur Russell song and Strangers by The Kinks together and hit it off right away. Then whenever Cate and her band came through Chicago on tour they would either stay at The Loft or use it for rehearsals. She just became part of the family.</p> <p>“And when I heard her version of the Wilco song <em>Company In My Back</em>, which she recorded at The Loft for a cover-mount CD for Mojo magazine, it blew me away because it was such an imaginative arrangement and a unique sound. So I thought I’d ask her to produce us.“</p> <p>A couple of the new songs are among the most politically pointed Tweedy has penned. Ten Dead came from a news story he saw on TV about yet another US school shooting.</p> <p>“The reporter literally said ‘only 10 dead’,” says Tweedy, slowly shaking his head. “He almost had this tone of disappointment that it wasn’t a bigger news story. Or maybe he was saying ‘Well, it’s good that it was only ten.’ Either way, it was an appalling thing to say.</p> <p>“And look, I know we hear people singing songs about things like this and go, ‘Oh yeah, the world was really waiting for you to weigh in on this. Thank you for appropriating someone else’s trauma.’ But I was trying to highlight the insanity of this becoming so matter-of-fact. The rational response to this is ‘No, this can’t happen anymore.’ It’s painfully obvious what we should do about it. Instead, we hear people talking about giving kids bulletproof backpacks.”</p> <p>The title track is close to home, aimed at relatives who expressed far-right views after Donald Trump came to power.</p> <p>“It’s really more about my dad than me. Before he died (in 2017) he saw family members turn their backs on democracy and decency. They felt emboldened to express their bigotry. It was something that deeply upset my father. He wasn’t a liberal by any means. He grew up in southern Illinois and he worked on the railroad. But he was decent and smart and thought Trump was what he called ‘a boss’s son’. And, in his mind, there was nothing worse than that.“</p> <p>Tweedy has a third book due out in November. <em>The World Within A Song</em> will be his deep dive into 50 songs by other artists. Despite the fact he had already written a memoir, he found this book ended up being even more autobiographical, “because songs become part of our own biography, they work their way into our memories and self-image.”</p> <p>Many of Tweedy’s choices will be unsurprising to those who follow his work: Mavis Staples, The Replacements, Dolly Parton, the Velvet Underground. But a couple may put the cat among Wilco’s “dad rock” contingent – and perhaps educate them.</p> <p>“I chose <em>I Love You</em> by Billie Eilish, because, like a lot of her songs, it has this majestic, sublime melody. I think she and her brother would have been successful songwriters and performers in any era. Her songs are like jazz or torch songs, but she’s extremely modern.</p> <p>“And I chose a song by Rosalia because I think she may be the greatest artist walking the earth right now. She has this incredible gift and she made this quantum leap from studying flamenco as a young girl to basically reinventing reggaeton music. It’s like she’s Miles Davis or Pablo Picasso. She had to be in the book.”</p> <p><strong><em>Cousin</em> is out now. Wilco play The Forum in Melbourne on March 16, 17 and 18; the Sydney Opera House on March 22 and the Enmore Theatre on November 22.</strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': 'The image presents a split composition, juxtaposing a headshot of a woman on the left with the cover of a book on the right.\\n\\n**Left Side (Headshot):**\\n\\nThe woman in the headshot appears to be middle-aged, with shoulder-length dark brown hair parted slightly off-center. Her expression is neutral, almost pensive, with her lips closed in a relaxed position. Her gaze is direct, looking straight at the camera. Her skin tone is light, with a natural complexion. She wears a dark v-neck shirt underneath a light gray, textured blazer or cardigan. The background consists of horizontal, dark-colored slats, likely part of a wall or other architectural feature. The lighting is even and soft, suggesting a professional or semi-professional setting for the photograph.\\n\\n**Right Side (Book Cover):**\\n\\nThe book cover features a vintage aesthetic, reminiscent of 1960s or 1970s fashion photography. A woman with long, light brown hair is seated in the driver\\'s seat of a convertible car. She wears large, round, white earrings and a flowing, sleeveless, mustard-yellow top or dress. Her profile is visible as she looks away from the camera, towards the road ahead.  She holds the steering wheel with one hand and rests the other on the car\\'s gear shift. The car itself is a light color, possibly white or cream, and the background suggests a cityscape or urban setting. The book title, \"ROMANTIC COMEDY,\" is displayed vertically along the left edge of the cover in bold, uppercase letters. The author\\'s name, \"CURTIS SITTENFELD,\" appears in a larger, bolder font at the bottom of the cover, also in uppercase.  Two blurbs, seemingly positive reviews or endorsements, are placed on the cover. One, attributed to Kate Atkinson, reads, \"One of my favourite writers\\'.\" The other, from Elizabeth Day, states, \"I am obsessed with this book. Warm, wise, extremely funny.\"  A smaller line of text at the bottom identifies the book as a \"Sunday Times and New York Times bestseller.\"\\n\\n**Relationship between the two halves:**\\n\\nThe juxtaposition strongly suggests that the woman in the headshot is Curtis Sittenfeld, the author of the book \"Romantic Comedy\" displayed on the right. The image likely serves as promotional material, combining a portrait of the author with the visually appealing book cover.\\n\\n**Detailed Description and Analysis:**\\n\\n**Headshot (Left):**\\n\\n* **Framing and Composition:** The headshot is tightly cropped, focusing on the woman\\'s face and upper torso.  The horizontal lines of the background provide a contrasting visual element to the subject\\'s vertical posture.\\n* **Lighting and Color:** The lighting is soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows and creating a natural look. The color palette is muted, with the gray blazer and dark shirt complementing the subject\\'s hair and skin tone.\\n* **Expression and Pose:** The woman\\'s expression is neutral and approachable, conveying a sense of confidence and professionalism. Her direct gaze engages the viewer, while her relaxed posture suggests a sense of ease and comfort.\\n\\n**Book Cover (Right):**\\n\\n* **Visual Style and Era:** The cover\\'s vintage aesthetic, characterized by the car, the woman\\'s clothing and hairstyle, and the color palette, evokes a sense of nostalgia and classic Hollywood glamour. This style likely aims to attract readers interested in romantic stories with a retro feel.\\n* **Typography and Layout:** The vertical placement of the title \"ROMANTIC COMEDY\" is unconventional yet eye-catching. The bold, uppercase font emphasizes the genre and creates a strong visual impact. The author\\'s name, prominently displayed at the bottom, reinforces brand recognition.\\n* **Imagery and Symbolism:** The image of the woman driving a convertible suggests independence, freedom, and a sense of adventure. The yellow top or dress adds a touch of vibrancy and optimism, while the urban setting hints at a sophisticated and contemporary backdrop for the story.\\n* **Blurbs and Endorsements:** The inclusion of positive blurbs from established authors like Kate Atkinson and Elizabeth Day adds credibility and social proof, encouraging potential readers to pick up the book.  The use of phrases like \"favourite writers\\',\" \"obsessed,\" \"warm,\" \"wise,\" and \"funny\" provides concise yet compelling insights into the book\\'s tone and content.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe combined image effectively promotes Curtis Sittenfeld\\'s book \"Romantic Comedy.\" The professional headshot presents the author in a relatable and approachable manner, while the eye-catching book cover conveys the genre and tone of the story. The vintage aesthetic and positive endorsements further enhance the book\\'s appeal, targeting readers seeking a lighthearted, romantic escape with a touch of classic Hollywood charm. The image is well-suited for use in online advertising, social media promotion, and other marketing materials.\\n\\n**Further Speculation and Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe title \"Romantic Comedy\" and the vintage aesthetic of the cover suggest a story that explores themes of love, relationships, and humor within a retro setting. The choice of a female protagonist driving a convertible might symbolize empowerment and a break from traditional gender roles. The endorsements hint at a well-written and engaging narrative that resonates with readers on an emotional level.\\n\\n**Target Audience:**\\n\\nThe image likely targets readers interested in romantic comedies, particularly those who appreciate a vintage aesthetic and witty writing. The endorsements from established female authors suggest a potential appeal to a predominantly female readership.\\n\\n**Marketing Strategy:**\\n\\nThe image\\'s clean design and clear messaging make it effective for various marketing channels. The combination of author portrait and book cover provides a comprehensive introduction to both the author and her work. The inclusion of endorsements and bestseller status adds credibility and encourages purchase consideration.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': 'This photograph captures a candid moment of two men, seemingly musicians David Byrne and Brian Eno, inside a Chemist Warehouse, a prominent Australian pharmacy chain. The image is rich in detail, showcasing not only the individuals but also the vibrant, bustling atmosphere of the store.\\n\\n**The Men:**\\n\\n* **David Byrne (left):**  Recognizable by his distinctive features and attire, Byrne stands slightly to the left of the frame. He is known as the former lead singer and guitarist of the influential new wave band Talking Heads. His musical career spans decades, marked by innovative work in various genres, including rock, funk, and world music.  He is also a visual artist, writer, and cyclist, known for his advocacy for urban cycling.  In the photograph, he wears a dark blazer over a dark, subtly patterned shirt and dark denim jeans. His expression is relaxed and approachable, almost as if he\\'s engaged in conversation.\\n\\n* **Brian Eno (right):**  Standing to the right, Eno, a renowned music producer, composer, and visual artist, complements Byrne\\'s presence.  Eno\\'s career is marked by pioneering work in ambient music and electronic music production. He has collaborated with numerous artists, including David Bowie, U2, and Coldplay, and is considered a highly influential figure in the music industry.  In the image, Eno wears a dark fedora, a dark blue plaid blazer, a black undershirt, and dark trousers.  He sports a full beard and a calm, almost contemplative expression.\\n\\n**The Setting: Chemist Warehouse**\\n\\nThe backdrop of the photograph is unmistakably a Chemist Warehouse. Several key visual elements confirm this:\\n\\n* **Bright Blue and Yellow Signage:** The dominant colors are the signature bright blue and yellow of the Chemist Warehouse branding. These colors are visible on the shelves, price tags, and promotional signs.\\n* **\"Cheaper @ Warehouse Prices\" Slogan:** This iconic slogan is clearly visible on yellow signs hanging from the ceiling, reinforcing the brand identity.\\n* **Product Placement and Pricing:** The shelves are stocked with a variety of health and beauty products, typical of a Chemist Warehouse.  Prominent brands like Colgate, Olay, and Nature\\'s Way are visible. The yellow price tags with black text are a characteristic feature of the store\\'s pricing strategy.\\n* **\"As Seen on TV\" Stickers:**  Many products feature circular stickers stating \"As Seen on TV,\" a common marketing tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.\\n* **\"Health Break\" Signage:**  The \"Health Break\" logo, a part of Chemist Warehouse\\'s branding for its health product sections, is visible on several shelves.\\n* **Metal Grid Shelving:** The metal grid shelving units are a standard fixture in Chemist Warehouse stores.\\n\\n**Composition and Details:**\\n\\nThe photograph is composed with the two men positioned centrally in the aisle, with shelves of products flanking them on both sides. This creates a sense of depth and draws the viewer\\'s eye towards the center. The aisle appears well-lit, likely due to fluorescent lighting typical of retail spaces.\\n\\nThe shelves are densely packed with products, creating a visually busy backdrop. The bright colors and varied packaging of the products contribute to the overall vibrancy of the scene.  The price tags, with their bold yellow and black design, stand out against the colorful products, emphasizing the store\\'s focus on value.\\n\\nThe \"3\" signs hanging from the ceiling, indicating further discounts, are a common promotional tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.  The \"Discount Chemist 50% Go\" sign suggests a sale or special offer on selected items.\\n\\nThe floor appears to be a light-colored tile, typical of retail environments.  A circular floor sticker, possibly indicating social distancing guidelines, is partially visible near Eno\\'s feet.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe photograph presents a striking juxtaposition of the two renowned musicians against the backdrop of a busy, everyday retail setting. The contrast between the artistic personas of Byrne and Eno and the commercial environment of Chemist Warehouse creates a sense of intrigue. The image captures a seemingly spontaneous moment, lending it a candid and unposed feel.  The vibrant colors, dense product displays, and prominent branding of Chemist Warehouse create a visually stimulating environment that further enhances the photograph\\'s impact. The presence of text throughout the image, from product names and prices to promotional slogans, adds another layer of detail and context. This photograph is not only a portrait of two influential musicians but also a snapshot of a particular time and place, capturing the essence of a ubiquitous Australian retail experience.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': \"The image features a middle-aged man with dark skin and greying hair sitting in a mostly empty movie theatre. He is the focal point of the photograph, and the composition uses a shallow depth of field to draw attention to him while blurring the background.  He appears thoughtful or perhaps contemplative, his expression neutral and his gaze directed towards the camera.\\n\\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the image's various elements:\\n\\n**The Subject:**\\n\\n* **Appearance:** The man appears to be in his 50s or 60s.

He wears glasses perched on top of his head.\\n* **Attire:** He is dressed in a light blue and white checkered long-sleeved shirt with a button-down collar. The shirt appears to be made of a lightweight, possibly cotton, fabric.  He wears dark-colored pants, likely navy blue or black, which are partially visible.  A dark-colored watch with a light brown band is visible on his left wrist.\\n* **Body Language:**  The man's hands are clasped in front of him, resting on his lap. This gesture, combined with his facial expression, suggests a contemplative or introspective mood. He sits slightly angled towards the camera, engaging the viewer directly.\\n* **Overall Impression:** The man projects an air of quiet dignity and seriousness.  His attire is casual yet neat, suggesting a relaxed but respectful demeanor.  His posture is relaxed but not slouching, indicating a sense of composure.\\n\\n**The Setting:**\\n\\n* **Location:** The setting is clearly a movie theatre or auditorium. The rows of red seats and the dim lighting are characteristic of such venues.\\n* **Seating:** The seats are upholstered in a rich, dark red fabric, likely velvet or a similar material. They are arranged in tiered rows, typical of a cinema or theatre. The seats appear to be well-maintained and relatively new.\\n* **Lighting:** The lighting is subdued, creating a dramatic atmosphere.  Two warm, yellowish lights are visible in the background, possibly wall sconces or ceiling fixtures. These lights are out of focus, contributing to the depth of field effect.  The overall lighting is low, suggesting that the photograph was taken during or just before a screening.\\n* **Ambiance:** The empty seats surrounding the man contribute to a sense of solitude and quiet contemplation. The darkness and the soft glow of the background lights create a peaceful, almost meditative atmosphere.\\n* **Background:** The background is intentionally blurred, drawing the viewer's attention to the man in the foreground. The rows of red seats recede into the darkness, creating a sense of depth and scale.\\n\\n**Composition and Technical Aspects:**\\n\\n* **Focus:** The photograph uses a shallow depth of field, with the man in sharp focus and the background blurred. This technique isolates the subject and emphasizes his presence in the frame.\\n* **Framing:** The man is positioned slightly off-center, creating a balanced composition that adheres to the rule of thirds.  The framing allows for ample space around him, enhancing the feeling of solitude.\\n* **Color Palette:** The image is dominated by warm tones, primarily the red of the seats and the yellowish glow of the background lights.  The man's blue and white checkered shirt provides a subtle contrast to the warm hues.\\n* **Lighting and Shadows:** The low lighting creates soft shadows on the man's face, adding depth and dimension to his features. The shadows are not harsh, contributing to the overall contemplative mood of the image.\\n* **Image Quality:** The image appears to be of high quality, with good resolution and detail.  The colors are rich and vibrant, and the textures of the fabric and the man's skin are clearly visible.\\n\\n**Possible Interpretations:**\\n\\nThe image invites several interpretations. The man's contemplative expression and the quiet setting could suggest:\\n\\n* **Reflection:** He might be reflecting on a film he has just seen or is about to see.\\n* **Solitude:** The empty seats around him emphasize a sense of solitude and introspection.\\n* **Waiting:** He might be waiting for a film to begin or for someone to join him.\\n* **Contemplation:**  His expression suggests a thoughtful state of mind, perhaps pondering something unrelated to the cinema setting.\\n\\n**Keywords for Image Retrieval:**\\n\\n* Man\\n* Portrait\\n* Movie theatre\\n* Cinema\\n* Auditorium\\n* Red seats\\n* Contemplative\\n* Thoughtful\\n* Solitude\\n* Empty seats\\n* Dim lighting\\n* Shallow depth of field\\n* Checkered shirt\\n* Glasses\\n* Mature adult\\n* African American\\n* Waiting\\n* Reflection\\n\\n\\nThis detailed description provides a comprehensive analysis of the image, covering the subject, setting, composition, and possible interpretations.

They are watching the movie clip on a laptop.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** Even today, the movies still terrify her.\\n\\nA clip from the movie is shown again, this time depicting the ground splitting open.\\n\\nThe scene cuts back to the two women on the couch.\\n\\n**Woman 2:** It\\'s hard to watch.\\n\\nWoman 2 begins to cry.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** What\\'s that bringing up for you?\\n\\n**Woman 2:** I just lived in fear of what my future looked like if I wasn\\'t doing exactly what I was told to be a good Christian and to follow an extensive set of rules and expectations of life. And so the fear was prominent in there all the time.\\n\\nThe scene shifts back to the beach, with the woman looking out at the ocean. The narrator says that Amy lived her young life constantly nervous that if she did something wrong, demons would grow inside her.\\n\\n**Woman 2 (in a different setting):** The word that my dad used was they were manifesting inside me. And that number would multiply until I had potentially thousands of demons inside me, which would be harder and harder to remove and to get rid of.\\n\\n**Woman 1 (in a different setting):** What were you doing that was wrong? What was considered bad behavior?\\n\\n**Woman 2:** Even something as simple as listening to non-Christian music or reading a book that was non-Christian would be considered bad behavior.\\n\\nThe scene returns to the beach, with the woman now sitting and watching the sunset.\\n\\nThe narrator says that both Amy and Katrina left the church as young adults. The scene shows Katrina, a woman with long brown hair, standing by a river at sunset, looking at a city skyline.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a night scene of a highway accident. A police car is heavily damaged, and a truck is visible in the background. The narrator says that neither Amy nor Katrina were shocked to hear of the link between the extreme sect and the tragedy on the Melbourne Freeway in 2020.\\n\\nA group of people in suits are walking down a city street. The narrator says that they can understand why the trucking boss, Simon Tuteru, thought prayer would fix the drug-addicted truck driver\\'s problems.\\n\\nA man with a white beard is shown praying, placing his hand on another man\\'s head.\\n\\nThe scene cuts back to the woman with long brown hair from the beginning.\\n\\n**Woman:** When I heard about the news, no doubt at all. I just was like, that is bang on what they do.\\n\\n**Woman 2:** The fact that he believed in voodoo and didn\\'t see it as someone who needed serious help doesn\\'t surprise me at all. And yeah, he believed that what he was doing was the right thing.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** And instead of telling him to get help,\\n\\n**Woman 2:** He prayed with him and cast a spell out of him.\\n\\n**Woman 2:** For the Potter\\'s House, that\\'s just normal. And something that they genuinely believe. In reality, I feel like anyone else would have known how to respond in that situation.\\n\\nA bald man is shown looking out a window with orange-tinted glass.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** Do you feel some remorse, even guilt, when you do hear these stories that occurred when you were the leader of the church?\\n\\n**Bald Man:** Absolutely. And you know, the first couple of years that I came out of the Potter\\'s House, every time I saw an ex-member, I just began the conversation with an apology. I was certainly never apologizing for any of the extreme acts that you\\'ve you\\'ve mentioned, but you know, I recognized I was a part of it. And I\\'ve been there since I was 19 years old, grew up in it, got very used to it, uh, and just didn\\'t see the errors and the extreme that were there.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** What\\'s your message for pastors in the Potter\\'s House now?\\n\\n**Bald Man:** My my word to the Potter\\'s House leaders would be rejoin the mainstream Christian church, allow them to bring that community correction in areas where they\\'ve overbalanced or gone into extreme. Allow those outside voices that will bring them back before anything else really serious happens.\\n\\nA group of people on a stage are singing and waving money. The narrator says that when Potter\\'s House senior member Simon Tuteru chose to pray for his exhausted truck driver and advised him to get back behind the wheel, four police officers lost their lives.\\n\\nPhotos of four police officers are shown.\\n\\nSimon Tuteru is shown walking down the street with two other people. The narrator says that three months after the tragedy, Victoria Police charged Tuteru with four counts of manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty, and a trial date was set. But in October last year, inexplicably, the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions dropped all the charges.\\n\\nSimon Tuteru is shown walking through a parking lot.\\n\\nThe narrator says that these days, Simon Tuteru is no longer a pastor but is still a senior member of the church. When they contacted him, he refused to tell them anything about what happened on that terrible afternoon three years ago. The church also wouldn\\'t comment.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s House Church building is shown from an aerial view.\\n\\nA man with long white hair and a beard is sitting on a couch with Woman 1. They are looking at a photo album.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** How does it feel then knowing that Simon Tuteru is a free man? He\\'s still attending church. He\\'s getting on with his life.\\n\\n**Man:** Frustrated that he is. Frustrated he\\'s not faced court for anything. And it riles to to anger almost. That\\'s how it feels. Shouldn\\'t have happened.\\n\\nThe man points to a photo in the album of a woman sitting on a deck at sunset.\\n\\n**Man:** That\\'s the sunset where our house is. And there she\\'s sitting on the deck with that sunset.\\n\\nThe man points to another photo of the same woman smiling in a car.\\n\\n**Man:** But Stuart Schultz is even more angry about the continued existence of the Potter\\'s House Church.\\n\\nA banner on a fence reads, \"COME AND RECEIVE A MIRACLE. HOPE, JOY, PEACE, HEALING, LIFE, A NEW FUTURE.\"\\n\\n**Man:** Now that he understands the role the church played in the death of his wife and her three colleagues, he\\'s calling for an inquiry into the church to make sure more accidents like this don\\'t happen again. There\\'s three levels of blame. The driver of the truck, uh, Tuteru, he was the manager. If Potter\\'s House is what\\'s influenced Tuteru to make those decisions to make single drive back on the road, uh, they\\'re to blame as well.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** So justice for you now means everyone who had a role\\n\\n**Man:** Yes.\\n\\n**Man:** They\\'ve got to be held to account for Kevin, Josh, and Glenn, and Lynette, and their families all need to have closure. They all need to have justice.\\n\\nA clock face with the words \"60 MINUTES\" is shown. The second hand moves from 0 to 30 seconds. The words \"COMING UP\" appear.\\n\\nA montage of clips is shown, featuring Hugh Sheridan in various roles and settings.\\n\\nA woman with short blonde hair, wearing a red suit, is sitting on a stool in front of a red curtain. A poster behind her reads \"WHO\\'S HUGH?\"\\n\\n**Woman:** There\\'s no dispute. Hugh Sheridan is one of the nicest people you could ever meet. On screen and in the theater, he\\'s also one of Australia\\'s finest and most loved actors. So, how does anyone make sense of this? In 2020, he became the target of a vile hate campaign that almost broke him. And the reason he was attacked so viciously…\\n\\nThe word \"NEXT\" appears.\\n\\nThe clock face with \"60 MINUTES\" is shown again.\\n\\nThe woman in the red suit is shown again.\\n\\n**Woman:** …is attacking an ally, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nHugh Sheridan is shown in an interview setting.\\n\\n**Hugh Sheridan:** I would have thought so, yeah.\\n\\nThe word \"NEXT\" appears again.\\n\\nThe clock face with \"60 MINUTES\" is shown again.\\n\\nThe woman in the red suit is shown again.\\n\\n**Woman:** Goodbye, job.\\n\\nA shirtless Hugh Sheridan is shown with tape over his mouth and the word \"FRAGILE\" written on it.

He emphasizes the importance of targeted relief for low-income individuals facing high rents and interest rates, suggesting rent assistance as a viable option. He cautions against broad-based relief, arguing that it could exacerbate the situation.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to a woman named Shantel Schmidt, a freelance writer, who recently experienced a significant rent increase of $700 per fortnight.  She is shown using her laptop, presumably managing her finances or seeking information about her rights as a tenant. The visuals shift between close-ups of her face and hands on the laptop, conveying her concern and the practical steps she\\'s taking to address the issue.\\n\\nThe narrator explains that Shantel and her housemates are planning to take their case to the tenancy tribunal. If they are unsuccessful, she might be forced to move out, becoming another victim of out-of-control inflation.\\n\\nThe scene changes to Shantel discussing the situation with a reporter in her kitchen. The reporter asks her about the concept of a \"fair go\" and whether she believes her situation aligns with it. Shantel acknowledges that everyone is feeling the pinch of inflation but expresses her belief that some people are taking advantage of the situation while others are struggling. She calls for greater empathy and fairness in dealing with the challenges posed by inflation.\\n\\nThe segment concludes with the show\\'s host wrapping up the regular program and inviting viewers to engage with the show on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.

       "   'description': 'Sure, here\\'s the detailed description of the video from 1800 seconds to 2400 seconds.\\n\\n**Category**\\nNews\\n\\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\\n\\nThe video segment begins with a man in a suit walking down a city street. The narrator states that the man, Chris Ridgeway, profited $1.6 million from a questionable global financial scheme. The narrator adds that millions more invested by Ridgeway\\'s clients are now missing. Ridgeway claims he doesn\\'t know what happened to the money, although he says others likely do.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a parking garage, where a man in a gray hoodie is shown. The audio plays Ridgeway stating that David Sutton would know where the money went.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to Ridgeway in a blue and white checkered shirt, sitting in a dimly lit room with a potted plant behind him. He reiterates that David Sutton would know where the money went, suggesting the reporter ask Sutton if given the opportunity.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a red blazer and a necklace. She appears to be in an interview setting.\\n\\nRidgeway is shown again, this time looking to his left with a slightly surprised expression.\\n\\nAn aerial shot reveals a large house with a pool, nestled among trees. The narrator states that David Sutton lives in a wealthy suburb on Sydney\\'s Northern Beaches.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a black blazer, walking towards a closed garage door. She approaches a side door and knocks several times, calling out for David Sutton and identifying herself as Adele Ferguson from 60 Minutes.\\n\\nThe scene briefly returns to the aerial shot of Sutton\\'s house.\\n\\nThe woman in the black blazer is then shown using her phone, presumably trying to contact Sutton. The scene changes to a beach setting, where the same woman is standing on the sand, holding her phone to her ear. Sutton\\'s voicemail message plays, indicating that the call went unanswered.\\n\\nA close-up of a phone screen shows a text message conversation. Sutton replies to Adele Ferguson via text, stating that his legal advice is not to speak to the media.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a brick house with a white door. A woman with dark hair, wearing a gray jacket and pearl earrings, knocks on the door. The narrator explains that they also tried to contact Sutton\\'s business partner in England, Andy Turner, to inquire about the missing money.\\n\\nThe camera focuses on a window of the brick house.\\n\\nThe woman at the door is shown again, this time speaking to a man who answers the door. The man is bald, wearing glasses and a dark gray t-shirt. He appears to be on the phone. The woman asks for Mr. Turner.\\n\\nThe narrator states that Turner sent a statement denying any wrongdoing.\\n\\nRidgeway is shown walking in a park area, carrying his suit jacket over his arm. He is wearing a light pink and white checkered shirt and a red and white striped tie.\\n\\nThe scene cuts back to Ridgeway in the dimly lit room, now wearing a watch. He says that he\\'s been hung out to dry and that he\\'s been the fall person in all of this. He adds that others are happy and have done nothing to help him.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a room with a large oval table, where several people are sitting and talking to a woman in a red and black patterned blazer. The woman is holding a pen and paper. One of the people at the table mentions intermediaries getting paid a lot of commission. Another person states that the people who trusted their money with Ridgeway have no sympathy for him.\\n\\nThe scene focuses on a man with short graying hair, wearing a blue and white checkered shirt. He says that it\\'s time for action to be taken.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a woman with short white hair, wearing a dark blue shirt. She suggests that the directors of the entities they invested in are likely planning their next company.

He is identified as former senator John Williams, who has been trying to help the investors who lost their money. He criticizes ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission) for being ineffectual. He accuses ASIC of being the definition of frustration and says that they have been trying to get ASIC to act for 11 years. He adds that there is no fear of punishment for wrongdoing, as people can siphon off commissions, break the law, and steal money without consequence.\\n\\nThe woman in the red and black patterned blazer asks what message this sends to criminals when ASIC doesn\\'t act.\\n\\nThe former senator replies that it sends a message that there is no fear of punishment.\\n\\nRidgeway is shown walking in a covered walkway, wearing a blue and white checkered shirt. He says that after years of deceit, finally coming clean to his clients and family has been his only option. He is asked what he thinks will happen. He replies that he may never be able to be a financial advisor again, may not be able to be a company director, and may end up being charged with fraud and going to jail. He expresses fear and horror at this prospect.\\n\\nThe woman in the red blazer asks Ridgeway if he says he\\'s sorry for his actions, and if she believes him. Ridgeway\\'s wife, a woman with blonde hair and black glasses, says she doesn\\'t know. She says that she spoke to him at Christmas and was prepared to listen to what he had to say. He told her and their children that he was sorry and wanted to fix things. She later found out that he was having an affair with someone else, which was another level of betrayal and lies. She says she doesn\\'t know the answer to whether she believes him.\\n\\nThe woman in the red blazer asks Ridgeway what he would say to his wife and kids. Ridgeway, now crying, apologizes and says he didn\\'t mean for this to happen. He just wanted them to have a good life.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to a graphic with the title \"The Confession\" and the producer\\'s name. A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a black blazer, sits in front of the graphic. She states that Ridgeway\\'s former employer, Shore and Partners, says he deliberately circumvented the company\\'s compliance procedures to deceive them. She adds that Shores is working to compensate the impacted parties. She also mentions that ASIC has permanently banned Ridgeway from any involvement in financial services.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to a graphic that says \"Coming Up.\" A man in a suit is walking on a bridge in a city. He is identified as Victor Gao, a former diplomat and expert in Chinese affairs, who is an unofficial mouthpiece for the communist regime. He says that many people in China consider bans by foreign countries to be a laughingstock because it reveals their weaknesses and inferiority. He adds that Australia should be confident about its own system rather than being threatened by TikTok. He says that such bans are racist and discriminatory.\\n\\nA woman in a red blazer is shown sitting in front of a graphic with the title \"The TikToking Time Bomb.\" She says that TikTok has been banned from Australian government phones and devices due to its Chinese ownership, which has angered the Chinese Communist Party. She adds that the CCP has warned Australia not to treat Beijing as the enemy.\\n\\nA montage of TikTok videos is shown. The narrator says that despite its fun and frivolity, TikTok is in serious strife. The world\\'s fastest-growing social media platform has been banned on government devices in the US, Canada, and across Europe, then in Australia.\\n\\nA woman in a blue and white patterned blazer is shown speaking in front of Australian flags.

       "   'headline': 'Curtis Sittenfeld’s celebrity romcom didn’t sweep me off my feet',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>Curtis Sittenfeld likes to pose questions with her novels. What if Hillary had refused to marry Bill? (<em>Rodham.</em>) What if <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> was set in contemporary times? (<em>Eligible.</em>) Why did Democrat-raised librarian Laura Bush marry boisterous Republican George W? (<em>American Wife</em>.)</p> <p>There’s an entertainment tradition of ordinary looking talented men pairing with spectacularly beautiful women. But it would never happen if the genders were reversed – would it? That’s the premise of Sittenfeld’s sixth novel.</p> <p>Sally Milner is a writer for <em>TNO</em>, a fictional <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. When her colleague Danny becomes engaged to a gorgeous celebrity, Sally writes a mocking sketch – The Danny Horst Rule – embodying the novel’s premise. That week, as she helps “cheesily handsome” pop-star guest host Noah write his own sketch, she feels an attraction spark. But it can’t be mutual – can it?</p> <p>The narrative tension, as with any romantic comedy, lies not in whether an attraction exists, or even if it will be consummated, so much as how that will happen, and the specifics of the obstacles they’ll overcome. An awareness of these genre mechanics is written into the novel.</p> <p>Sally’s ambition is “to write non-condescending, ragingly feminist screenplays for romantic comedies”. She tells Noah, “When one of these movies doesn’t work, it’s usually because it’s horribly written and/or because the script hasn’t done the work of convincing you the couple is attracted to each other, so then you don’t care if obstacles get in their way and keep them apart.”</p> <p>Sittenfeld creates a convincing connection between Sally and Noah: they describe their creative work – her comedy and his music – as the loves of their lives. So it makes sense that work is how their true selves are revealed and connect.</p> <p>The conflict between our public and private selves has been central to Sittenfeld’s work since her debut, <em>Prep</em>, whose hyperaware, awkward teen protagonist embodied it. Sally suspects much of her writing emerges from that tension. And she tells Noah, “Sometimes I feel like I’m writing dialogue for the character of myself. I’m impersonating a normal human being when really I’m a confused freak.”</p> <p>This aspect of Sally feels palpably real and suits a comedy writer: humour as armour; a protective layer to shield the real, vulnerable self. And theories such as the Danny Horst Rule feel like believable ways of protecting against romantic rejection.</p> <p>Sally hasn’t allowed herself to have real relationships since a fellow <em>TNO</em> writer denied a mutual attraction she’d imagined, years ago. (Another Sittenfeld theme: young Hillary misreads male friendships in <em>Rodham</em>, and a similar situation plays out in the title story of Sittenfeld’s collection, <em>You Think It, I’ll Say It</em>.) “You’ve confused the romance of comedy with the comedy of romance,” Sally’s colleague told her.</p> <p>It’s a good line. But there aren’t enough of them in <em>Romantic Comedy</em>. Sittenfeld can be a master of sardonic, devastatingly arch observational wit. She employed it beautifully in <em>Eligible</em>; perhaps it helped to borrow the skeleton of the most popular romantic comedy of all time.</p> <p>Comedy is subjective, of course, but I didn’t find the jokes in this novel very funny. A skit about dogs doing Google searches fell flat. I groaned at many behind-the-scenes barbs among the comedy writers, such as Danny’s: “It’s very demeaning that you think my vagina needs cleaning. It shouldn’t smell floral when I’m getting oral.”</p> <p>And while <em>Romantic Comedy</em> convinces readers of the connection between Sally and Noah, its characters and world often lack the texture of real life. Noah, repeatedly referred to as “cheesily handsome”, often reads more like a cipher than a real person. He once greets Sally with, “Those are great fancy shoes.” Danny and Annabel’s relationship is cliched even when it tries to draw us in: Danny loves to gaze into Annabel’s eyes on her bed with a million pillows “like in the fanciest hotel”. And Sittenfeld often uses bland descriptions that show us nothing. In the <em>TNO</em> boss’ office, people sit on “the surprisingly crappy furniture in the surprisingly unfancy space”.</p> <p>The pace crawls in the section set at <em>TNO</em>, which takes up nearly half the book. Sittenfeld comprehensively researched<em> Saturday Night Live</em>; unfortunately, the text is weighed down with mechanical detail about the running of the show. The prose comparatively springs in its absence after the action moves location halfway through.</p> <p>Further drafts may have moved this novel past the stage of being bogged in research. They might have sharpened the details and honed the comedy. But as it stands, <em>Romantic Comedy</em> feels like a promising sketch for a better novel.</p> <p><em><strong>Romantic Comedy</strong></em><strong> by </strong><strong>Curtis Sittenfeld is published by </strong><strong>Doubleday, $32.99.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jo Case is deputy books and ideas editor for <em>The Conversation</em>.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

       "   'description': '<p>Six of the best diversions, including what to watch, read, eat and buy.</p> <h3><strong>SPOTLIGHT / Star Witness</strong></h3> <p>G<i>wyneth Paltrow’s Trial Is Her Best Role in Years</i> declared a recent headline in <i>The New Yorker</i> – and it’s not wrong. The Academy Award winner was the subject of a civil suit in a Utah court regarding a so-called ski-and-run accident in 2016. The actress was accused of running into a fellow skier while holidaying with her family. She said au contraire – <i>he</i> ran into <i>her</i>.</p> <p>The court found in Paltrow’s favour (#Gwynnocent) but no one really cared about the nuts and bolts of the case. Instead, the world binged it like a Netflix drama, tuning in to check out Paltrow’s daily court looks (she’s wearing a turtleneck!) and quoting her most iconic one-liners, including the new meme: “Well, I lost half a day of skiing.”</p> <p>It’s the latest in a long line of celebrity court battles to have captured the public fascination, stretching back to 1995 and OJ Simpson’s “trial of the century”. Last year delivered Johnny Depp v Amber Heard, which spawned a parallel trial on TikTok in which social media users declared Depp the innocent party and Heard guilty of, well, everything. A timely reminder, perhaps, that treating the courtroom as soap opera can have troubling real-world consequences. One worth remembering, given the next celebrity to take the stand will be one Donald Trump – a man who knows the power of performance better than anyone. <em><strong>Thomas Mitchell</strong></em></p> <h3><strong>SHOP / Swap shop</strong></h3> <p>Flaunting a fin-shaped design and made from repurposed coffee husks, the HuskeeCup is a stylish reminder to choose to reuse. Drinkers buy a cup, which come in a range of sizes, from a participating cafe <a href=\"https://huskee.co/8oz-cup-lid-natural/\" target=\"_blank\">(8oz cup in charcoal or natural, $20)</a> when ordering their caffeine fix, then return it when placing their next order (no need to even wash it). The “deposited” cups are sanitised and put back in rotation, with customers leaving with their fave brew in a “new” one. In due course, all cups, lids and saucers can be returned to Huskee or its swap partners – an app shows their locations – for end-of-life recycling. <em><strong>Frances Mocnik</strong></em></p> <h3><strong>EAT / Golden brown</strong></h3> <p>Spice up your weekend with a teaspoon of Golden Vadouvan, a sweet, smoky spice blend of roasted onions and garlic with turmeric, mustard seed, bittersweet fenugreek and more<a href=\"https://www.essentialingredient.com.au/products/golden-vadouvan\" target=\"_blank\"> (150g, $22.50)</a>. It’s Indian but also French, said to have been created by the French colonists of Pondicherry (now Puducherry) on India’s south-eastern coast, and it will take your salmon kedgeree to the next level. Beat it into butter to pan-fry fish and melt over carrots, or just sprinkle over your weekend eggs for an instant wow factor. <em><strong>Jill Dupleix</strong></em></p> <h3><strong>READ / Role reversal</strong></h3> <p>Ever wondered why good-looking, talented women often date average-looking but interesting guys, while the reverse rarely happens? In <i>Romantic Comedy</i> by American novelist Curtis Sittenfeld, Sally is a divorced 30-something writer for a hit TV comedy show. Fed up with seeing gorgeous female celebrities hook up with the show’s dorky male writers, she writes a sketch about it. Enter Noah, a handsome rock star and guest on the show. The sexual tension escalates as they banter their way through lockdown via email. Among the book’s pithy one-liners: “Hot eventually gets boring but funny never does.” Sittenfeld has form in analysing relationships: she’s the author of bestselling 2020 novel <i>Rodham</i>, which reimagined the life Hillary Rodham would have had if she’d not married Bill Clinton. <em><strong>Nicole Abadee</strong></em></p> <h3><strong>WEAR / Step right up</strong></h3> <p>How many pairs of shoes does a man <i>need</i>? Four, according to the founders of shoe company Etymology – Gabriel Abi-Saab and brothers William and Albert Phung. A loafer or two, an Oxford and something not black. The Sydney-based trio founded the company during the pandemic and this month released their four-pair debut collection, which leans heavily into the loafer. The all-leather shoes are handcrafted in family-run workshops in the Spanish shoe-making capital of Almansa, and <a href=\"https://etymologyau.com/products/ito-penny-loafer-black-calf\" target=\"_blank\">retail here online for $425</a> a pair. The inspiration? Abi-Saab’s Lebanese-Australian heritage: “My dad always wore this pair of loafers he found in Lebanon, even when going to the greengrocers. He took pride in the way he dressed.” Taking following in dad’s footsteps to a whole new level. <em><strong>Melissa Singer</strong></em></p> <h3><strong>WATCH / Dead Ringers</strong></h3> <p>It’s always a concern when a TV series or film casts an actor to star opposite themselves; the double-up can be great but can also be a gimmick used to paper over a thin plot. It worked a treat for Eddie Murphy in <i>Coming To America</i> but not in <i>The Nutty Professor</i>, while John Malkovich proved there is no such thing as too much Malkovich in <i>Being John Malkovich</i>. Thankfully, British actress Rachel Weisz is so charming in <i>Dead Ringers</i> (Amazon Prime) that you never get sick of seeing her star alongside herself. In this modern take on David Cronenberg’s 1988 thriller, Weisz plays twin gynaecologists whose desperation to change how women give birth pushes them into ethically questionable territory. <em><strong>Thomas Mitchell</strong></em></p> <p><b>To read more from</b><b><i> Good Weekend </i></b><b>magazine, visit our page at</b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i></b></a><b>,</b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i></b></a><b> and</b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\" target=\"_blank\"> <b><i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i></b></a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>The interaction of the past with the present is the faultline on which great stories are built, sure. But many <i>Sex and the City </i>superfans were dismayed to learn, via the trailer for the second series of <i>SATC</i>’s sequel <i>And Just Like That, </i>that the show will recycle Carrie’s old boyfriend Aidan into her life.</p> <p>Aidan Shaw was one of the two most important of Carrie’s love interests during the long-running show, the beta male in the love triangle he (unwittingly) participated in with Carrie and the horrendous Big.</p> <p>Big was the alpha whose emotional avoidance was dressed up as mystery, a man so emotionally unavailable that Carrie never even felt entitled to use his real name (which turned out to be John – apt because Big/John was revealed to be decidedly average once Carrie finally captured him and they settled down).</p> <p>Aidan was folksy and handsome, a carpenter who worked with his hands and wore lumberjack shirts without any apparent sense of irony. He loved his dog. He loved Carrie. He made a chair that she bought for her apartment. What could be so bad about that?</p> <p>As many <i>SATC</i> scholars have elucidated since, Aidan didn’t <i>really</i> love Carrie just as she was. He hated her smoking. He hated her going out. He hated her attachment to her glamorous lifestyle. Had he even met Carrie? That’s all she was – a smoker with a glamorous lifestyle who enjoyed going out a lot.</p> <p>Aidan hauled Carrie, the Manhattan denizen fuelled by Cosmopolitans and the <i>New York Times</i> Style section, into the woods to hang out at his bug-infested cabin. He trapped her into commitment by buying the apartment next door and knocking down the wall between them. She felt invaded. Was it any wonder she resumed the ciggies in secret and started an affair with the now-married Big?</p> <p>Yes, Carrie was awful: neurotic, flighty, self-absorbed and terrible with money. But she was not as bad as the men she dated.</p> <p>To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the iconic show – which was probably the biggest single cultural influence on women of a generation – <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/sex-and-the-city-20th-anniversary-worst-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Vanity</em><i> Fair</i> published an article titled “Who was the worst man on <i>Sex and the City</i>?”</a></p> <p>It’s a close-fought contest. My vote would go to the horrid Jack Berger, a brooding wannabe literary novelist who went into a prolonged sulk when Carrie’s (non-literary and therefore inferior, in his eyes) book was published to great success.</p> <p>Many of Carrie’s romantic trials involved men who were attracted to her success and independence but were threatened by it. Big at least let Carrie be Carrie. But even the bad men of <i>Sex and the City</i> all had something superficially attractive about them.</p> <p>The annals of romantic comedy are full of unkempt and even oafish men who score hot babes – think the 2007 Judd Apatow film <i>Knocked Up</i>, in which a stoner slacker (played by Seth Rogen) wins over the successful and attractive Alison, after impregnating her during a one-night stand. Or <em>Notting Hill</em>, where the hopeless Hugh Grant character snags a movie star.</p> <p>Woody Allen’s entire <i>oeuvre </i>(which has become tricky anyway, for other well-documented reasons I won’t delve into here) depends upon the premise that a beautiful, clever woman will be irresistibly drawn to a nebbish, prickly man who is deeply selfish, just because he cracks a few self-deprecating jokes and knows a lot about classic cinema.</p> <p>Many sitcoms rely on the trope of a grumpy and/or hopeless husband who is adored by his efficient and attractive wife (my favourite episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> is where Marge snaps because she doesn’t get enough help around the house; she is sent away for a break to a spa called Rancho Relaxo. But Homer is so incompetent he loses baby Maggie while his wife is away and has to call a Missing Baby Hotline to locate her).</p> <p>It has been a quarter-century since <i>Sex and the City </i>first aired, and it busted genres while creating its own. It has heavily influenced its successors – everything from the Millennial homage of <i>Girls</i>, to shows like <i>Derry Girls</i>, the delightful Irish comedy series about a group of teenagers, whose antics are set against the backdrop of Northern Ireland during the Troubles in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>In the ensuing decades, the ideal male romantic lead has evolved somewhat. The recent bestselling book by cult American author Curtis Sittenfeld, <i>Romantic Comedy</i>, up-ends the trope of the “schlubby” male hero who lands the hot, eligible chick just by making her laugh.</p> <p>The book asks why the opposite case is not often portrayed - why do we never see a frumpy-but-funny woman capturing the attention of a handsome, highly successful hero? (Although it must be said, Bridget Jones was a bit this person.)</p> <p>It then goes on to explore that very scenario, with a male love interest who is hot, talented and famous, but also slightly insecure (he wears a wig). Our hero openly admits he is no match for the clever wit of our heroine, who has sub-Hollywood looks and is skittish around commitment.</p> <p>The world’s most-read contemporary author, Colleen Hoover, who has barnstormed traditional publishing with her popular fiction, upturned the ideal of the male hero in her most famous book, <i>It Ends With Us</i>. The hero is introduced as dark, mercurial and emotionally elusive, but when the heroine finally lands him, she finds out the truth – he is prone to volcanic rages, and he hurts her when he’s in the grips of them.</p> <p>In this story, the archetypal hero is a trap, and the heroine’s real struggle is to free herself. The heroines of 2023 crave freedom, and men who will give it to them. But romance still has a momentum of its own – Hoover wrote the sequel, <i>It Starts With Us, </i>because her fans wanted her to, and they specifically told her they wanted their heroine to fall in love again and stay there, this time.</p> <p>Reader: she gave them what they wanted.<b></b></p> <p><strong>Jacqueline Maley is a columnist.</strong></p> <p><b><i>The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own. </i></b><b><i>Sign up here</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong>HOLLYWOOD</strong><br/><em><strong>Burn It Down: Power, Complicity and a Call for Change in Hollywood </strong></em><br/><strong>Maureen Ryan</strong><br/><strong>HarperCollins, $60</strong></p> <p>Maureen Ryan is as mad as hell about what’s been happening in Hollywood. And the<em> Vanity Fair</em> contributing editor has written <em>Burn It Down</em> to tell readers why. “What should be assessed is not just the creative product, its financial cost, and its efficiency (or lack thereof),” she writes, “It’s also how productive and nurturing an environment it is.” Something that she goes to great lengths to explain isn’t happening now and never has been.</p> <p>Her book, which deals mainly but not exclusively with the world of television, was written before the recent strikes by the American Writers and Screen Actors Guilds and doesn’t deal directly with the specific issues that have provoked them. But it does point to a range of resentments that have been simmering away for years, to do with how workplaces that ought to service the needs of employees have frequently become hellholes.</p> <p>To most readers, much of this won’t come as a surprise. Hollywood has long been infamous for what was once seen as routine behaviour but is now regarded as disreputable. The public testimonies of the courageous survivors of sexual assaults by men in powerful positions have exposed some of the darker activities hidden behind the surface gloss of the American film business.</p> <p>Ryan mentions in passing that she herself suffered this fate at the hands of an unnamed TV executive. She wrote at some length about it in <em>Variety</em> in October 2017, and her smouldering anger about what happened permeates the book.</p> <p>Drawing on the experiences of a young actress, she even goes so far as to liken what goes on in Hollywood to the way cults conduct themselves. “How is a cult that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day all that different from a set (or a workplace) that keeps people running around for 14 to 18 hours a day?“</p> <p>Her overall approach is messy, featuring long-winded attempts to explode myths about the Hollywood business, most of which were blasted to smithereens long ago. But she also provides compelling, detailed accounts of the failures and moral breakdowns that have occurred behind the scenes on the long-running series, <em>Lost</em> (2004–2010) and <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> (2013–2017), and that (contrary to the view that emerges, fictionalised, in Curtis Sittenfeld’s irresistible novel, <em>Romantic Comedy</em>) allegedly continue at NBC’s <em>Saturday Night Live,</em> the late-night sketch comedy show that has been around for almost half a century, and elsewhere.</p> <p>Some of her sources allow her to use their names; others choose to remain anonymous whistleblowers, fearful of the consequences for their careers if they become known as troublemakers. She manages to get a few of those accused – “the sinister forces in the shadows” – to go on the record with their responses, but most ignored her requests for interview.</p> <p>Stories abound of nightmare situations arising in writers’ rooms, on sets and in private offices, around racism, sexism, homophobia, inequitable returns for efforts, and the systemic abuse of those without power. Ryan’s crusader-like passion sometimes leads to overkill, the litany of sins that she uncovers providing more examples than required to make her points when a more selective approach would have been more effective.</p> <p>But it does mean that many of those that the system has turned into victims do get an opportunity to have their voices heard, even if only as “Joyce” or “Hannah”, or any of the other names she attaches to those who wish to avoid reprisal.</p> <p>Ryan is especially illuminating in her examination of some of the disturbing developments at <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. In this context, she cites journalist Seth Simons’ astute but unfashionable notion that stand-up comedians have long occupied a space for an ugly culture, one “where it has been OK to be a horrible person” (a point that becomes especially pertinent in the light of the coverage of Russell Brand’s transgressions).</p> <p>In the final section of the book, acknowledging that there’s no magic fix for the problems she’s identified, Ryan proposes several ways in which it might be possible to repair “the damage created by allowing toxic people – and systems – to run amok”.</p> <p>She quotes <em>The Atlantic’s</em> Adam Serwer about the best way to go about it: “The hope for a more equitable, democratic and prosperous society does not lie with enlightened corporations but with organised workers.” And, in line with this, she points to the need for writers, actors and others to work together to establish grassroots alliances and respectful workplaces in which to do their creative work.</p> <p>She ends by explaining that she’s no revolutionary, that she doesn’t actually want to burn Hollywood down. What she really wants is a business equivalent of a “prescribed burn”, one that can help prevent a wildfire. “Fire can be rejuvenating,” she writes, creating a neat analogy courtesy of <em>National Geographic</em>. “It returns nutrients to the soil … and can help young trees and other plants start to grow.”</p> <p><em>Burn It Down</em> sometimes labours its points, but the urgency with which Ryan champions her cause is both affecting and effective.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>Bill Lawrence has a gift for TV comedy and his special skill is ensembles. And while you might not be familiar with his name, it’s likely that you’ve seen, and perhaps even loved and admired, some of his work. It’s most recently on display in <em>Shrinking</em> and <em>Ted Lasso</em> (both Apple TV+), but stretches back to <em>Spin City</em> (Stan*) and <em>Scrubs</em> (Disney+).</p> <p>Dubbed “Television’s Anonymous Mogul” in a <em>Los Angeles Times</em> profile, Lawrence has been working steadily for decades. Although in his early days he was sacked from the writing team on <em>Friends</em> – “I was a kid. I misbehaved a bit,” he subsequently explained – he soon rebounded. Teaming up with Gary David Goldberg (<em>Family Ties</em>), he created <em>Spin City</em> (1996-2002), the first of his beautifully balanced ensemble comedies.</p> <p>In a long career, he’s had some misfires (remember <em>Whiskey Cavalier</em>, <em>Undateable</em>, <em>Surviving Jack</em> or <em>Life Sentence</em>? No? Not surprising). But the good ones are memorable and display a capacity to create vibrant communities in an array of settings: the New York mayor’s office in <em>Spin City</em>; a Sacramento hospital in <em>Scrubs</em> (2001-10); a fictional Florida district in <em>Cougar Town</em> (2009-15); an English soccer club in <em>Ted Lasso</em>; a Pasadena psychology practice in <em>Shrinking</em>.</p> <p>Sometimes, his series feature workplace families with artfully jumbled bags of diverse personalities; sometimes they’re biologically connected families, along with their friends, neighbours and work colleagues. In classic sitcom style, each character contributes a distinctive note to the whole: a dumb one, a daffy one, a pompous one, a smart and sassy one, a neurotic, etc.</p> <p>Wherever they live and whatever they do, in the best of Lawrence’s work these ensembles present vibrant, idiosyncratic and very funny characters in productions distinguished by clever casting and pitch-perfect tones. As neatly illustrated by <em>Shrinking</em> and <em>Ted Lasso</em>, they can bounce confidently from laugh-out-loud physical gags and goofy humour to more tender moments where the multi-dimensional characters reveal their vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Lawrence isn’t a one-man band: often his comedies are created and produced with others. <em>Ted Lasso</em> was developed with Jason Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt and Joe Kelly, and there’s a phalanx of producers, including Brett Goldstein, who plays Roy Kent. But there’s a discernible thread running through Lawrence’s productions, no matter who he’s working with, and that’s the strength of the communities that he constructs.</p> <p>One indicator of how well they’re structured is how many of the supporting characters become scene-stealers, even when the shows are ostensibly built around a prominent lead, such as Michael J. Fox in <em>Spin City</em>, Sudeikis in <em>Ted Lasso</em> or Jason Segel in <em>Shrinking</em>. That’s because the writing is so strong and the casting is spot on. The focus of <em>Spin City</em> might be Fox’s deputy mayor, but as well as giving us the wonderful Connie Britton in a feisty early role, there’s the joy of Richard Kind’s sweet, bumbling, perpetually flustered press secretary. <em>Scrubs</em> follows the misadventures of Zach Braff as the caring, adorably discombobulated Dr John “J.D.” Dorian. But Sarah Chalke’s contribution as the delightfully ditzy Dr Elliot Reid would be right at home in a classic 1930s Hollywood screwball comedy (which is high praise).</p> <p>My litmus test of a great ensemble is that it’s hard to pick a favourite character. In <em>Ted Lasso</em>, for example, there’s robust competition for that distinction: is it the magnificently monosyllabic Roy Kent? Indomitable, effervescent Keeley (Juno Temple)? Sweet Nigerian winger Sam Obisanya (Toheeb Jimoh)? Perhaps Dani Rojas (Christo Fernandez) with his sunny smile and gleeful pronouncement that “Football is life!” Titular Ted might be the main man, but, while taking nothing away from the nominal protagonist, the wealth of talent around him makes the series stronger.</p> <p>That’s also true of <em>Shrinking</em>, where co-creator and co-producer Segel plays Jimmy, a psychologist and widower grieving the recent death of his wife (Lilan Bowden) and destructively spiralling. As it begins, he’s seeking comfort in drugs and casual sex, and failing to be the parent that his wounded teenage daughter, Alice (Lukita Maxwell), desperately needs.</p> <p>Jimmy works in a practice with a trio of therapists and each of them is as much in need of supportive counselling as their patients. Gaby (Jessica Williams) is dealing with divorce and blithely maintaining she’s fine, when clearly she isn’t. Paul (Harrison Ford) is trying to manage a health issue and is troubled by a strained relationship with his adult daughter (Lily Rabe).</p> <p>Beyond the core characters is a skilfully fleshed-out community, among them Jimmy’s nosy neighbour, Liz (Christa Miller, Lawrence’s wife, who also appeared in <em>Scrubs</em> and <em>Cougar Town</em>), his best friend, hilariously fast-talking gay lawyer Brian (Michael Urie), and his patient, war veteran Sean (Luke Tennie), who’s suffering from PTSD and dealing with anger-management issues. Notably, too, Ford is in his element as the grumpy elder of the practice, a terse type who protectively guards his personal space only to find it continually invaded by his colleagues.</p> <p>As with <em>Ted Lasso</em> – whose fourth season has been the subject of fervid speculation – <em>Shrinking</em> was originally pitched with a three-season structure, with the first to focus on grief, the second on forgiveness and the final one on moving forward.</p> <p>The first season has set the bar high, with a line introduced in the first episode and repeated in the final one to significantly different effect neatly illustrating the quality of the writing. Initially, Jimmy looks lovingly at Alice and tells her how much she reminds him of her mother, an observation that’s filled with pain. In the final episode, when the line is repeated, there’s only love and pride. Without labouring the point, the series illustrates how far the pair has come.</p> <p>It’s classic Lawrence. So remember the name, because when you see it on a comedy, it’s likely to be worth watching.</p> <p><strong>* Stan is owned by Nine, the owner of this masthead.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

Each night, Cosgriff solicits her audience to find out their top 10 likes – all of which she notes down in a self-professed “book of tiny delights”.</p> <p>Interspersed with this gentle form of audience participation are humorous anecdotes and highly infectious, clever, original songs that Cosgriff belts out about her own likes while her hands move across her keyboard at a dizzying pace. Cosgriff’s a whip-smart, quick-witted, confident performer.</p> <p>It becomes clear towards the end that what undergirds the show is a simultaneous sense of sorrow and joy – it’s a credit to Cosgriff that she can hold space for both, leaving audiences with an incredibly affirming (and funny) show that marvels in the tiny profundities that make up our lives.<br/><em>Reviewed by Sonia Nair</em></p> <p><strong>COMEDY</strong><br/><strong>Patrick Golamco | Pork Adobo</strong><br/><a href=\"https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2023/shows/pork-adobo\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trades Hall, until April 23</strong></a></p> <p>Patrick Golamco is surely a lock for a Best Newcomer nomination this festival.</p> <p>Having come runner-up in the 2021 RAW Comedy National Grand Final, and storming Comedy Zone in 2022, his debut Melbourne solo show is loosely tied together by a story of visiting his 99-year-old grandmother in Manila to let her know he loves her while she may be on her deathbed.</p> <p>Through song, breakneck-speed jokes and tales of therapy gone awry, he harnesses the neurotic, introverted nature of Luke McGregor, the shake-your-head puns of Tim Vine and the pull-the-rug-from-your-feet energy of Mitch Hedberg all at once.</p> <p>There are sharp jabs at Catholics, his Chinese upbringing, and of course, tales of the titular recipe – all which are delivered with the aplomb of a festival veteran.</p> <p>At only 40 minutes in length it’s on the leaner side of shows this year.

In 2007, he won the top gong at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. If the rules allowed you to win more than once, he’d have another half-dozen on his mantelpiece.</p> <p>Make no mistake – Kitson is the greatest comedian of his generation. Even if his aversion to press, media and podcasts means the majority have never heard of him. When other comedians see him perform, often they consider quitting the art form, knowing that they’ll never reach the same heights. It’s known as a term within the cognoscenti as “the Kitson effect”.</p> <p>Does this all sound sycophantic? Probably. But is it hyperbole? Absolutely not.</p> <p>A poll conducted by Dave, a TV channel that is a subsidiary of BBC, saw British comics including the ilk of Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee, Tim Vine, Mark Watson, Jason Byrne and Greg Davies all agreeing that he reigned supreme.</p> <p>The sold-out audience for the stuttering Brit’s latest 90-minute show at 12pm on a Sunday is filled to the brim with other award-winning comics from the festival watching on.</p> <p>The show is a masterclass of delivery, quips and callbacks.

       "   'description': '<p>Disney may be better known for its theme parks and blockbuster movies, but its streaming service successfully draws on a pair of historic America television networks, spin-offs from its fabled franchises, and a growing cohort of original commissions. Putting together the platform’s essential scripted shows required difficult choices, but the list is illustrious.</p> <p><b>Abbott Elementary<br/></b>The great American sitcom is not dead, it’s just morphed into this delightfully witty mockumentary about the ever-burdened staff at a primary school in West Philadelphia. Creator and star Quinta Brunson delivers 22-minute episodes that sing with character humour and absurd machinations. Janella James, as the school’s questionable principal, is the best scene-stealer on television right now.</p> <p><b>The Americans<br/></b>What began as a sharp Cold War thriller, following a pair of Russian spies (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) living as a couple complete with children in Washington DC, became a masterful study of what we will and won’t reveal to those closest to us. Deception has rarely been so intensely intimate, culminating in a note-perfect finale after six seasons.</p> <p><b>Andor<br/></b>The rough equation is <i>Star Wars</i> with less Jedi and more John le Carre, but that doesn’t do justice to Tony Gilroy’s brilliant prequel series about how the dedicated spy from 2016’s <i>Rogue One</i> movie (Diego Luna), found his calling as a revolutionary. Dispensing with nostalgia but staging gripping set-pieces, this is a galaxy far, far away reimagined for adults.</p> <p><b>Arrested Development<br/></b>Ignore the subsequent Netflix revival, the original three seasons of this wonderfully loopy comedy about a dysfunctional family’s downfall constitute one of the funniest shows of this century. Jason Bateman is the dutiful son trying to hold everything together, but he’s surrounded by self-sabotaging kin whose antics are perfectly shaped by dry digressions, meta-commentary, and brain-bending ramifications.</p> <p><b>Atlanta<br/></b>Donald Glover’s surrealist-tinged comedy about a struggling college graduate (Glover) who works as the manager of his rapper cousin (an immense Brian Tyree Henry) was one of the most ambitious shows television has witnessed, and mostly it succeeded. The implications of being Black in America spiralled into uncomfortable realities, otherworldly horror, and soulful self-recognition.</p> <p><b>The Bear<br/></b>”Yes, chef!” A blackly comic drama about a fine dining savant (Jeremy Allen White) returning to run his late brother’s Chicago sandwich joint, the two seasons to date of this series have been defined by corrosive tension, whiplash humour, and family dynamics that are painfully gripping. Watching creativity and renewal take hold for these characters is both a blessing and a curse.</p> <p><b>Bob’s Burgers<br/></b>It took a season to get going but Loren Bouchard’s animated sitcom about the family behind a New Jersey burger joint has become one of television’s enduring pleasures. The Belcher clan are a wonderful mix of characters, driving a winning sense of humour that eschews pop-culture references for a depiction of the everyday that is charmingly plausible.</p> <p><b>Buffy the Vampire Slayer<br/></b>The original slay queen, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Geller) is a Californian high school student chosen to battle the forces of evil. It’s the first of many inspired mash-ups in this deeply influential supernatural adventure, which shines as a tale of feminist empowerment, a goofy serial, and a homage to friendship powered by rat-a-tat dialogue.</p> <p><b>Desperate Housewives<br/></b>Is it a soap opera or a satire of a soap opera? Marc Cherry’s blockbuster comedy about the many intrigues surrounding a group of neighbouring married women was both and much more. Upending how network television depicted wives, life on Wisteria Lane was wild, insightful, and given to almighty twists.</p> <p><b>Homeland<br/></b>Episodic television has rarely seen a performance as fierce and finely judged as the one Claire Danes delivers in this spy drama, playing an obsessive CIA agent with bipolar disorder. The early seasons, with Damian Lewis as a possible foe hiding in plain sight, are a sinewy two-hander, before Danes’ Carrie Mathison becomes the focus of a taut, globe-trotting study of betrayal and sacrifice.</p> <p><b>How I Met Your Mother<br/></b>If you crave the reassuring familiarity of a multi-camera studio sitcom, the nine seasons of this Hollywood comedy about the loves and laughs of a group of (initially) twentysomethings will hit the spot. The punchlines are sharp but the casting is perfect: Jason Segel, Cobie Smulders, Alyson Hannigan, and a fearless Neil Patrick Harris shine.</p> <p><b>Loki<br/></b>The one television spin-off of Marvel’s movie blockbusters that mattered follows the titular brother of Thor, Tom Hiddleston’s capricious, arrogant Loki, who finds himself caught up with the agency regulating time itself and its representative, Owen Wilson’s laconic investigator. The unlikely duo’s double act is the show’s selling point, a give and take that is verbally dexterous and emotionally primed.</p> <p><b>Lost<br/></b>The network drama that didn’t so much kick the door in for grandiose ambitions as knock the entire house down, the 121 episodes of this science-fiction laced epic gave us smoke monsters, temporal shifts, labyrinthine conspiracies and a handful of finely revealed characters. The mysterious island they were trapped on was a puzzle box of vast possibility, somehow kept in motion through six seasons.</p> <p><b>Mrs America<br/></b>Cate Blanchett, Rose Byrne, and Uzo Aduba headline an exemplary cast in this historical drama about the 1970s battle in America between second-wave feminists and the conservative women who opposed them. This is a vivid, telling recreation, with depictions of real-life figures that are anything but textbook – these public and private conflicts are both nuanced and prescient.</p> <p><b>The Muppet Show<br/></b>As the oldest show on this list – it ran between 1976 and 1981 – there are certainly dips in Jim Henson’s ground-breaking reinvention of the variety show, but Kermit, Miss Piggy, and their iconic fellow hand puppets thoroughly transcend the era. The best guests gave the backstage absurdity an artful, idiosyncratic charge, with guests like Elton John, Gilda Radner, and John Cleese.</p> <p><b>NYPD Blue<br/></b>Controversial when it debuted in 1993, Steven Bochco and David Milch’s police procedural about a fictional Manhattan precinct raised the bar for the cop drama with intertwining storylines, pungent dialogue, and reflections on trauma. David Caruso ducked out after one season, but the pairing of Jimmy Smits and Dennis Franz gave the show a memorable core that carried it to classic status.</p> <p><b>One Mississippi<br/></b>Debuting in 2015 and unfairly cancelled after just two seasons, comedian Tig Notaro’s semi-autobiographical series has her playing a breast cancer patient who returns to her hometown to care for her dying mother. The observational comedy that ensures is deeply personal, heartbreaking in its misunderstandings, and willing to suspend reality to grasp deeper truths. This hidden gem is ripe for rediscovery.</p> <p><b>Only Murders in the Building<br/></b>Steve Martin, Selena Gomez, and Martin Short are aces together in this farcical crime caper about a trio of true crime podcast addicts who start recording when a neighbour in their NYC apartment block is murdered. It’s a rapid-fire satire and deadpan comedy of manners, but its secret weapon is a melancholic undertow that makes the motives tragic and the investigators dedicated to their unlikely friendship.</p> <p><b>The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story<br/></b>The murder trial that transfixed America 30 years ago is re-examined in a limited series that reveals the distorting nature of fame, rampant ego, and sexist double standards. In an all-star cast none surpass Courtney B. Vance as defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran: a showman created by the very system he despises.</p> <p><b>Pose<br/></b>Boisterous with a bittersweet chaser, this drama recreates in stunning detail the ball subculture in 1980s New York, where Black and Latino drag queens competed for recognition in private tournaments while representing their unofficial families. It’s hectic and not always subtle, but the show does what its historic subjects did: it claims space for the marginalised and lets their stories resonate.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': '‘Something is going to happen’: Jerry Seinfeld hints at sitcom reunion',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>It’s like Festivus for <em>Seinfeld</em> fans. Jerry Seinfeld has hinted that he and his fellow cast members might make a return to the classic ’90s sitcom.</p> <p>Answering a question from the audience about whether he liked <em>Seinfeld’s</em> final episode at a stand-up show in Boston, the 69-year-old comedian said he had a “little secret” about the ending.</p> <p>“But I can’t really tell it because it is a secret,” he said. “Here’s what I’ll tell you, OK, but you can’t tell anybody. Something is going to happen that has to do with that ending. Hasn’t happened yet.”</p> <p>Seinfeld indicated to the audience that he was already in discussions with Larry David, who created one of the greatest sitcoms in television history with him.</p> <p>“And just what you are thinking about, Larry and I have also been thinking about,” he said. “So you’ll see, you’ll see.”</p> <p><em>Seinfeld</em>, which also starred Jason Alexander, Michael Richards and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, ran from 1989 to 1998. Its popularity has endured through countless repeats on free-to-air TV and streaming services and a long list of catchphrases that have entered the vernacular, including “no soup for you”, “double dipper”, “close talker”, “giddyup!“, “Hello, Newman”, “master of my domain”, “They’re real and they’re spectacular!“, “yada yada yada” and “Not that there’s anything wrong with that”.</p> <p>The finale was an extended episode that had Jerry, Elaine, Kramer and George jailed for violating a local law after their private plane was force to land in a small town in Massachusetts. It received mixed reviews from critics and fans but was watched by a massive 76.3 million fans – 58 per cent of the audience – in the US alone.</p> <p>There was immediate speculation about whether the reunion was for a commercial, possibly for the Super Bowl, or whether it was for the 12th and reputedly final season of David’s sitcom <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>.</p> <p>But given filming wrapped on the last episode months ago, Seinfeld’s reference to “hasn’t happened yet” suggests it is not that. In 2009, the four <em>Seinfeld</em> stars appeared in the seventh season of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> when David tried to initiate a reunion of the sitcom to win back his ex-wife.</p> <p>Could it be a reboot for a streaming service like <em>Frasier</em> or <em>Full House</em>? That’s unlikely given Seinfeld seems content doing stand-up and whatever else he feels like doing, and <em>Forbes</em> has reported he had earned $US267 million from the show in 1998 and refused NBC’s offer of more than $US100 million to make a tenth season.</p> <p>Seinfeld has previously teased the cast returning.</p> <p>On <em>The Daily Show With Jon Stewart</em> in 2007, he mentioned possibly shooting one last scene where the characters had left jail. On the DVD for the final season of <em>Seinfeld</em>, the comedian said he and Alexander had spoken about this scene being in Monk’s Cafe.</p> <p>But at the end of the Boston show, details of the reunion were in the vault.</p> <p><strong>Email Garry Maddox at <a href=\"mailto:gmaddox@smh.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">gmaddox@smh.com.au</a> and follow him on Twitter at <a href=\"mailto:gmaddox@smh.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">gmaddox@smh.com.au</a>.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56jp0\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

At his suggestion, we had dinner at a small, decidedly modern restaurant not far from his home in San Francisco.</p> <p>Halfway through the meal, he held up his iPhone so I could see the contract he had spent the past several months negotiating with one of the world’s largest tech companies. It said Microsoft’s billion-dollar investment would help OpenAI build what was called artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a machine that could do anything the human brain could do.</p> <p>Later, as Altman sipped a sweet wine in lieu of dessert, he compared his company to the Manhattan Project. As if he were chatting about tomorrow’s weather forecast, he said the US effort to build an atomic bomb during World War II had been a “project on the scale of OpenAI — the level of ambition we aspire to.”</p> <p>He believed AGI would bring the world prosperity and wealth like no one had ever seen. He also worried that the technologies his company was building could cause serious harm — spreading disinformation, undercutting the job market. Or even destroying the world as we know it.</p> <p>“I try to be upfront,” he said. “Am I doing something good? Or really bad?”</p> <p>In 2019, this sounded like science fiction.</p> <p>In 2023, people are beginning to wonder if Altman was more prescient than they realised.</p> <p>Now that OpenAI has released an online chatbot called ChatGPT, anyone with an internet connection is a click away from technology that will answer burning questions about organic chemistry, write a 2000-word term paper on Marcel Proust and his madeleine, or even generate a computer program that drops digital snowflakes across a laptop screen — all with a skill that seems human.</p> <p>As people realise that this technology is also a way of spreading falsehoods or even persuading people to do things they should not do, some critics are accusing Altman of reckless behaviour.</p> <p>This past week, more than a thousand AI experts and tech leaders called on OpenAI and other companies to pause their work on systems such as ChatGPT, saying they present “profound risks to society and humanity.”</p> <p>And yet, when people act as if Altman has nearly realised his long-held vision, he pushes back.</p> <p>“The hype over these systems — even if everything we hope for is right long term — is totally out of control for the short term,” he told me on a recent afternoon. There is time, he said, to better understand how these systems will ultimately change the world.</p> <p>Many industry leaders, AI researchers and pundits see ChatGPT as a fundamental technological shift, as significant as the creation of the web browser or the iPhone. But few can agree on the future of this technology.</p> <p>Some believe it will deliver a utopia where everyone has all the time and money ever needed. Others believe it could destroy humanity. Still, others spend much of their time arguing that the technology is never as powerful as everyone says it is, insisting that neither nirvana nor doomsday is as close as it might seem.</p> <p>Altman, a slim, boyish-looking, 37-year-old entrepreneur and investor from the suburbs of St Louis, sits calmly in the middle of it all. As chief executive officer of OpenAI, he somehow embodies each of these seemingly contradictory views, hoping to balance the myriad possibilities as he moves this strange, powerful, flawed technology into the future.</p> <p>That means he is often criticised from all directions. But those closest to him believe this is as it should be. “If you’re equally upsetting both extreme sides, then you’re doing something right,” said OpenAI’s president, Greg Brockman.</p> <p>To spend time with Altman is to understand that Silicon Valley will push this technology forward even though it is not quite sure what the implications will be. At one point during our dinner in 2019, he paraphrased Robert Oppenheimer, leader of the Manhattan Project, who believed the atomic bomb was an inevitability of scientific progress. “Technology happens because it is possible,” he said. (Altman pointed out that, as fate would have it, he and Oppenheimer share a birthday.)</p> <h3>The vegetarian cattle farmer</h3> <p>The warning, sent with the driving directions, was “Watch out for cows.”</p> <p>Altman’s weekend home is a ranch in Napa, California, where farmhands grow wine grapes and raise cattle.</p> <p>During the week, Altman and his partner, Oliver Mulherin, an Australian software engineer, share a house on Russian Hill in the heart of San Francisco. But as Friday arrives, they move to the ranch, a quiet spot among the rocky, grass-covered hills. Their 25-year-old house is remodelled to look both folksy and contemporary. The Cor-Ten steel that covers the outside walls is rusted to perfection.</p> <p>As you approach the property, the cows roam across both the green fields and gravel roads.</p> <p>Altman is a man who lives with contradictions, even at his getaway home: a vegetarian who raises beef cattle. He says his partner likes them.</p> <p>On a recent afternoon walk at the ranch, we stopped to rest at the edge of a small lake. Looking out over the water, we discussed, once again, the future of AI.</p> <p>His message had not changed much since 2019. But his words were even bolder.</p> <p>He said his company was building technology that would “solve some of our most pressing problems, really increase the standard of life and also figure out much better uses for human will and creativity.”</p> <p>He is very much a product of the Silicon Valley that grew so swiftly and so gleefully in the mid-2010s. As president of Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley startup accelerator and seed investor, from 2014-19, he advised an endless stream of new companies — and was shrewd enough to personally invest in several that became household names, including Airbnb, Reddit and Stripe. He takes pride in recognising when a technology is about to reach exponential growth — and then riding that curve into the future.</p> <p>His longtime mentor, Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, explained Altman’s motivation like this: “Why is he working on something that won’t make him richer? One answer is that lots of people do that once they have enough money, which Sam probably does. The other is that he likes power.”</p> <h3>‘What Bill Gates must have been like’</h3> <p>In the late 1990s, the John Burroughs School, a private prep school named for the 19th-century American naturalist and philosopher, invited an independent consultant to observe and critique daily life on its campus in the suburbs of St Louis.</p> <p>The consultant’s review included one significant criticism: The student body was rife with homophobia.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, Altman, a 17-year-old student at John Burroughs, set out to change the school’s culture, individually persuading teachers to post “Safe Space” signs on their classroom doors as a statement in support of gay students such as him. He came out during his senior year and said the St Louis of his teenage years was not an easy place to be gay.</p> <p>Georgeann Kepchar, who taught the school’s Advanced Placement computer science course, saw Altman as one of her most talented computer science students — and one with a rare knack for pushing people in new directions.</p> <p>“He had creativity and vision, combined with the ambition and force of personality to convince others to work with him on putting his ideas into action,” she said. Altman also told me that he had asked one particularly homophobic teacher to post a “Safe Space” sign just to troll the guy.</p> <p>Graham, who worked alongside Altman for a decade, saw the same persuasiveness in the man from St Louis.</p> <p>“He has a natural ability to talk people into things,” Graham said. “If it isn’t inborn, it was at least fully developed before he was 20. I first met Sam when he was 19, and I remember thinking at the time: ‘So this is what Bill Gates must have been like.‘”</p> <p>Altman is not a coder or an engineer or an AI researcher. He is the person who sets the agenda, puts the teams together and strikes the deals. As the president of Y Combinator, he expanded the firm with near abandon, starting a new investment fund and a new research lab and stretching the number of companies advised by the firm into the hundreds each year.</p> <p>He also began working on several projects outside the investment firm, including OpenAI, which he founded as a non-profit in 2015 alongside a group that included Elon Musk. By Altman’s own admission, Y Combinator grew increasingly concerned he was spreading himself too thin.</p> <p>He resolved to refocus his attention on a project that would, as he put it, have a real impact on the world. He considered politics, but settled on AI.</p> <p>Altman believed, according to his younger brother Max, that he was one of the few people who could meaningfully change the world through AI research, as opposed to the many people who could do so through politics.</p> <p>In 2019, just as OpenAI’s research was taking off, Altman grabbed the reins, stepping down as president of Y Combinator to concentrate on a company with fewer than 100 employees that was unsure how it would pay its bills.</p> <p>Within a year, he had transformed OpenAI into a non-profit with a for-profit arm. That way, he could pursue the money it would need to build a machine that could do anything the human brain could do.</p> <h3>The man in the middle</h3> <p>In March, Altman tweeted out a selfie, bathed by a pale-orange flash, that showed him smiling between a blond woman giving a peace sign and a bearded guy wearing a fedora.</p> <p>The woman was Canadian singer Grimes, Musk’s former partner, and the hat guy was Eliezer Yudkowsky, a self-described AI researcher who believes, perhaps more than anyone, that AI could one day destroy humanity.</p> <p>The selfie — snapped by Altman at a party his company was hosting — shows how close he is to this way of thinking. But he has his own views on the dangers of AI.</p> <p>Yudkowsky and his writings played key roles in the creation of both OpenAI and DeepMind, another lab intent on building artificial general intelligence.</p> <p>He also helped spawn the vast online community of rationalists and effective altruists who are convinced that AI is an existential risk. This surprisingly influential group is represented by researchers inside many of the top AI labs, including OpenAI. They don’t see this as hypocrisy: Many of them believe that because they understand the dangers clearer than anyone else, they are in the best position to build this technology.</p> <p>Altman argues that rather than developing and testing the technology entirely behind closed doors before releasing it in full, it is safer to gradually share it so everyone can better understand risks and how to handle them.</p> <p>He told me that it would be a “very slow takeoff.”</p> <p>When I asked Altman if a machine that could do anything the human brain could do would eventually drive the price of human labour to zero, he demurred. He said he could not imagine a world where human intelligence was useless.</p> <p>If he’s wrong, he thinks he can make it up to humanity.</p> <p>He rebuilt OpenAI as what he called a capped-profit company. This allowed him to pursue billions of dollars in financing by promising a profit to investors such as Microsoft. But these profits are capped, and any additional revenue will be pumped back into the OpenAI non-profit that was founded back in 2015.</p> <p>His grand idea is that OpenAI will capture much of the world’s wealth through the creation of AGI and then redistribute this wealth to the people. In Napa, as we sat chatting beside the lake at the heart of his ranch, he tossed out several figures — $US100 billion, $US1 trillion, $US100 trillion.</p> <p>If AGI does create all that wealth, he is not sure how the company will redistribute it. Money could mean something very different in this new world.</p> <p>But as he once told me: “I feel like the AGI can help with that.”</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p> <p><strong><i>The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion. </i><i>Sign up to get it every weekday morning</i><i>.</i></strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong>FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Firelight</strong></em><br/><strong>John Morrissey, Text, $32.99<br/></strong><br/>First Nations fiction and sci-fi might sound like strange bedfellows, although anyone who saw the Shadow Spirit exhibition at Melbourne’s Rising festival this year (which featured First Nations <em>Star Wars</em> characters alongside ancient stories and cultural knowledge) will know how fertile their conjunction can be. Kalkadoon author John Morrissey has produced a suite of short stories – some of them sci-fi, most within the realms of magical realist or speculative fiction – that investigate colonialism and identity with a keen eye and an uninhibited imagination. It’s a volume that features a little green man and the colonisation of the Moon, fraught attempts by scientists to reconstruct a thylacine, and a Gothic-tinged revenge fantasy in which an Aboriginal warrior haunts the white explorer responsible for his murder. An elegant and unpretentious narrative style allows Morrissey to reach for outlandish or bizarre elements with the irreducible impact of a lucid dream. It’s a fable-like, inventive, and well-crafted collection.</p> <p><em><strong>Serengotti</strong></em><br/><strong>Eugen Bacon, Transit Lounge, $32.99</strong></p> <p>Eugen Bacon’s<em> Serengotti</em> follows Ch’anzu, a gender-nonconforming narrator, on a day from hell. Ch’anzu loses hir job, and walks in (totally hungover) on hir wife Scarlet having pneumatic sex with a guy half her age. The opening chapters are set in contemporary Melbourne but there’s a hyperactive buzz of disorientation and dislocation in the prose, which has a futuristic feel and surges forward using the unusual second-person perspective. You’re put into Ch’anzu’s shoes as hir life crisis leads first to the wisdom of Aunt Mae, and on to a migrant African community, Serengotti, deep in the Australian bush. Eugen Bacon has a propulsive experimental style that voraciously incorporates idiom from urban, internet, Australian and African contexts to forge something new. Momentum builds quickly in this rush of a novel, which illuminates questions of gender and race as they are experienced, and has a sharper focus on how the world turns in urban Australia than most new fiction.</p> <p><em><strong>Prophet</strong></em><br/><strong>Helen Macdonald &amp; Sin Blache, Jonathan Cape, $34.99</strong></p> <p>Co-written during lockdown by Helen Macdonald (<em>H is for Hawk</em>) and Sin Blache,<em> Prophet</em> literally weaponises nostalgia. The title refers to a military-grade chemical that causes those exposed to it to fall into a nostalgic trance, creating figments of the past from treasured memories. Naturally, such a weapon could be disastrous in the wrong hands. And perhaps there are no right hands, as two agents – super-buff American action hero Adam, and dissolute but sharp-minded Rao, a former British intelligence operative – discover. Following Prophet’s destructive trail from Britain to the American West, it seems Prophet has new properties waiting to be unleashed. This sci-fi queer romance espionage thriller smashes together a bewildering array of genre fiction tropes, but it’s obsessively crafted, and has the kind of philosophical underpinning that makes it read more like postmodern fabulism than fanfic.</p> <p><em><strong>Temperance</strong></em><br/><strong>Carol Lefevre, Wakefield, $34.95</strong></p> <p>It’s 1963 and widowed café owner Stella Madigan struggles to make ends meet after the death of her husband. The arrival of unconventional artist Mardi Rose promises a reprieve from working-class life for Stella and her young children, Fran and Theo, but when they embark upon a road trip to Byron Bay, they make it only as far as the tiny hamlet of Temperance in the Australian Outback. There, a horrifying and half-remembered incident turns the family back, and it will plague the children into their adult lives. Award-winning writer Carol Lefevre has a deft touch for psychological drama and the intricacies of domestic relationships. Here she takes a tightly stretched working-class canvas and loosens it into an evolving mystery (and a deferred coming-of-age tale) spanning decades. Lefevre is particularly good at showing the subtle effects of trauma, and the intensity of repressed emotion.</p> <p><strong>NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK</strong><br/><em><strong>Beeswax and Tall Tales</strong></em><br/><strong>Jane Crowley with Athol Salter, Ventura Press, $32.99</strong></p> <p>This polished collection of tales from the antiques trade could easily have been sub-titled “Life’s Little Ironies”, for the way it reflects human foibles in all their variety. Jane Crowley’s father, Athol Salter, has spent a lifetime buying and selling antiques and throughout that time continually shared the stories he gathered along the way with his daughter. Written from her father’s point of view, the stories are full of intriguing characters, from shifty types who get their comeuppance, a sad widower in Wagga whose last wish before suiciding is denied him by big-city lawyers, and a Welsh collector whose dying business is, to an extent, emblematic of the trade. And all of them revolving around selling artefacts, be it a bath, a chiffonier or an old farm table. Lovingly crafted and sure-footed, this could become a collector’s item.</p> <p><em><strong>Girls [Don’t] Play Sport</strong></em><br/><strong>Chloe Dalton, Allen &amp; Unwin, $34.99</strong></p> <p>When Chloe Dalton was young watching her brothers play rugby she would practise kicking at half-time, often being told by adults that she should play the game. Her reply was, “Girls don’t play rugby”. In 2016 she won Olympic rugby gold in Rio. Her journey, her successes and her experience inform this combination of treatise and memoir. It also provides a snapshot of women in sport, citing, say, the struggle that swimming legend Fanny Durack had to get to the 1912 Olympics. In what is basically a call to arms she highlights the achievements, and prejudices that women’s sport still faces: pay, training facilities, misogyny, trolling and the reaction to the now iconic photo of Tayla Harris goaling from the 50-metre mark. Deeply passionate, her enthusiasm is infectious, and we can only hope one day nobody will think twice about girls playing footy – or any other sport, for that matter.</p> <p><em><strong>The Chipilly Six: Unsung Heroes of the Great War</strong></em><br/><strong>Lucas Jordan, NewSouth, $34.99</strong></p> <p>It takes a certain type of larrikin daredevil to do what six Australians soldiers did in the middle of the Battle of Amiens in August 1918. The allied offensive had been stopped by a line of German machine gunners on the spur above the Somme village of Chipilly. Repeated frontal assaults had failed. During the morning sergeants Jack Hayes and Harold Andrews went for a “stroll” into the village looking for souvenirs – as you do. That night they led a patrol of six, flanked the German gunners and took them out, capturing 71 prisoners and nine machine guns – achieving what an entire army couldn’t. It’s impossible to read this ripping, vivid recreation of events without shaking your head in disbelief. For years history paid scant attention to the “six”. This account (covering post-war years) and drawing on firsthand testimony corrects that.</p> <p><em><strong>The Shrinking Nation</strong></em><br/><strong>Graeme Turner, UQP, $32.99</strong></p> <p>This is a sort of report card on Australian politics over the past 15 years, and it’s not good. The phrase “must try harder” comes to mind. Australia and the world have changed enormously in that time, but our national governments have gone missing in vital areas such as climate change, social welfare and closing the gap. The period, especially from Tony Abbott’s government on, was marked by what we might call policy paralysis, the ship of state was left to drift and the country has shrunk, so it’s “less than it was, less than it should be”. Graeme Turner’s clear, emphatic, convincing examination is a big-picture study of a time when the big picture deserted our politics. It’s also a searing indictment of decades of neo-liberalist hypocrisy. But there’s also hope, with Turner seeing positives in the busyness of the Albanese administration.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong>Spoiler Alert </strong>★★★½<br/><strong>M, 112 minutes</strong></p> <p>The title of Michael Ausiello’s bestselling memoir, <em>Spoiler Alert: The Hero Dies</em>, mixes irony and bravado in equal measure.</p> <p>Ausiello says his book isn’t a “misery memoir”. Even though the plot hinges on a diagnosis of terminal cancer, fun and romance have equally important parts to play.</p> <p>Michael Showalter’s film of the book drops the spoiler from the title, but we learn the worst in the opening scene. Then we’re into a flashback recounting what is essentially a love story. It begins in 2001 when Ausiello (Jim Parsons) and Kit Cowan (British actor Ben Aldridge) meet at a Manhattan club.</p> <p>They’re an unlikely pair. Kit is a buff, charming photographer who has always preferred casual sex to steady relationships, and Michael (Jim Parsons) is a nerdy vegetarian who drinks Diet Coke and wears button-down shirts buttoned up. He’s an entertainment journalist with a special interest in sitcoms and soaps. And that’s not all. When Kit is finally permitted to visit his apartment, he finds that it’s been colonised by the Smurf collection Ausiello has been acquiring since childhood.</p> <p>Ausiello wrote the book after Kit’s death. It grew from a series of Facebook posts read by the couple’s family and friends, one of whom was an editor at Simon &amp; Schuster. And Showalter has succeeded in catching its spirit – its intimacy, its self-deprecating sense of humour and Ausiello’s habit of seeing life through the prism of the television shows he loved as a kid. Both his parents died when he was young and the shows take him back to the times when he was at his happiest. So, too, does the Smurf collection.</p> <p>Kit’s parents are very much alive. His mother, Marilyn (Sally Field) competes in triathlons – despite her stately pace and dodgy knees – and his father, Bob (Bill Irwin) is kept busy carrying out his wife’s orders. Kit’s relationship with Michael finally gives him the courage to tell them that he’s gay and they do better than approve. They embrace Michael as a surrogate son.</p> <p>The film is episodic in shape. The couple go through many ups and downs during the 13 years they spend together and the script canvasses them all. Sometimes the tone is a little too cute but Showalter (<em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em>) and his writers have a persuasive ability to defuse the looming threat of sentimentality with comedy.</p> <p>Aldridge is terrific as the easy-going Kit, who’s been blessed with such physical confidence that the disease comes as both shock and betrayal, and Field knows exactly when to rein in the indomitable Marilyn. It’s a disarming film.</p> <p><strong><em>Spoiler Alert</em> is in cinemas from February 9.</strong></p> <p><b><i>A cultural guide to going out and loving your city. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=culture-fix\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up to our Culture Fix newsletter here</a></i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': '‘Bubble of chaos’: Tony Shalhoub on his Marvelous Mrs Maisel character',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>Speaking from his New York apartment on the eve of an international press tour to promote the fifth and final season of <i>The Marvelous</i><i> Mrs Maisel</i>, Tony Shalhoub is happy and sad. The award-winning stage and screen actor (<i>Big Night, Wings, Monk</i>) knows that he’s been part of something special, a TV series that he appreciatively describes as “rare”. But for him and his fellow cast and crew members, whom he describes as “tightly knit”, there’s also regret that it’s come to an end.</p> <p>However his pride in the celebrated period comedy’s nine-episode final season is evident. “The scripts were great,” he says, adding that the showrunners, creator, writer, producer and director Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, writer, producer and director Daniel Palladino, “really know how to land a plane.” With the final scenes shot in November, he reflects, “It’s been a great world to occupy and I think that we all feel that we would’ve loved it to go on for at least one, if not two, more seasons. But they all have to come to an end at some point, I guess.”</p> <p>Premiering in 2017, the series immediately made its mark as a lavish, witty and vibrantly colourful production that seemed as though it was itching to bloom into a Hollywood musical. Set in the late-1950s, it charted the initially accidental career of a Jewish mother of two in the cut-throat, male-dominated world of comedy. And its New York looked like jewel-box fantasy land, from the uptown delis to the inky downtown clubs.</p> <p>The series deftly establishes its title character, Miriam “Midge” Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan), as a woman who possesses a natural, yet untapped, gift for stand-up. That’s until one drunken night when, having discovered her husband’s infidelity, she stumbles on stage at a club and proceeds to unload her piercing observations about men and marriage. It then follows her bumpy progress, including the horror of her parents, Abe and Rose Weissman (Shalhoub and Marin Hinkle), when they discover where she’s sneaking out to at night.</p> <p>In addition to its lush look, the series has been distinguished by cracking, densely written dialogue, fired off at machine-gun speed. Finely crafted barrages between the characters are often coupled with elaborate, flowing, single-take shots (known as “oners”) which are frequently choreographed through bustling settings: department stores, diners, hotels.</p> <p>Describing the oners, Shalhoub says, “It seemed like an ambitious way to work, but a lot of us have worked in the theatre and it’s reminiscent of that. You just have to shift your thinking: you’re doing one-act plays every day as much as you’re shooting television. It calls upon the kind of discipline that the theatre requires, forcing you to listen more, to be more focused, and it’s gratifying. It brings out everyone’s best because, when it works, it’s exhilarating. And when we stumble, it’s understandable because it’s a high-wire act.”</p> <p>The style of the series created the need for a production that operated differently from the customary TV model. “Normally, the amount of time that you have to rehearse is limited,” says Shalhoub. “Sometimes the oners would take a whole morning to rehearse, and that’s very rare. Normally you set up the blocking quickly, get the camera angles in there, light it and go, go, go. Because you’re always playing beat-the-clock. This series had a different kind of energy.”</p> <p>As Midge made her way through the comedy scene, Shalhoub’s character confronted his own obstacles. Abe started out as a university professor, secure in his place in the world, moved on to commercial consulting work, lost his job and eventually became a cravat-wearing theatre critic. Meanwhile Midge’s mother, Rose, turned her talent for matchmaking into a business.</p> <p>“They live in a kind of bubble of chaos,” says Shalhoub of the Weissmans. “But they’re all fighters. We see Midge survive a broken marriage and a challenging rollercoaster career as a stand-up. I can’t help but think that it’s kind of hereditary in the sense that’s she’s a survivor and Abe and Rose are that way too. They come from that kind of stock.</p> <p>“Thanks to our brilliant writers, Abe and Rose have an opportunity to reinvent their lives. They just won’t roll over and give up. I think Midge carries that with her too and we see that played out in Midge and Joel’s (Michael Zegen) children: they’re scrappy and they survive.”</p> <p>That kind of development is also rare, he observes: “It’s a luxury for an actor. If you’re on a long-running series, there’s always that danger of getting painted into a corner, where you’re called on to do just a few things, repeated and repeated. I think that the writers have serviced all of the characters really well.”</p> <p>While Abe is shown to sometimes be pompous and fairly clueless in dealing with his young grandchildren, Shalhoub views his character’s shortcomings with affection: “He’s a man of his time. It was part of the culture, the zeitgeist, and for me it’s what makes the writing interesting and relevant. That’s the brilliance of starting this story in the late ’50s and moving it into the early ’60s because that’s the time when a whole cultural shift was commencing.”</p> <p>He also notes that there are developments in the final season that surprised him. It features inspired flashes-forward to the 1980s, allowing viewers to see, in tantalising drip-feeds, where some of the characters end up 20 years later. “There are things in the final few episodes that happen to Abe that I did not see coming,” says Shalhoub. “When we first meet Abe, his grandchildren are there, they’re underfoot, so to speak. But being a man of his time and his age, he thinks that it’s the job of his children to worry about those children, that they should be seen-and-not-heard kind of thing. But in the later episodes we see Abe’s awakening and investment in that next generation.”</p> <p>While aware that a special project has come to a close, Shalhoub is moving back to the future, starting work on a telemovie revival of his Emmy-winning, obsessive-compulsive detective character, Adrian Monk, whom he played for eight seasons until 2009. “There was talk over the years that we should we revisit it, but now feels like the right moment,” he explains. “It’s Monk having gotten through the pandemic and being knocked on his heels again.” Then he adds with a chuckle, “He’s older now, so, for my sake, he’s not doing the kinds of things that he did 15 years ago, like chasing down garbage trucks. He’s not that guy any more. It’s only one telemovie, but who knows, we’ll see how it goes.”</p> <p>But as he prepares to reacquaint himself with Monk, he’s farewelling an ambitious production that he sees as “colourful, celebratory, a big gigantic musical”, the marvel that is <i>Mrs Maisel.</i></p> <p><strong>The Marvelous Mrs Maisel (fifth season) is on Amazon Prime Video from Friday April 14.</strong></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'The 20 best shows to stream on Netflix right now',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>It’s a near-impossible task, but the finished list is worth the struggle. In compiling Netflix’s 20 essential shows, I had a few simple parameters: scripted only (no documentaries or reality fare), mix the signature hits with the lesser-known, and recognise the breadth of the streaming service’s programming. Your favourite show might not be here, then again neither is mine.</p> <p><strong>Beef</strong></p> <p>Starting with a road rage incident and escalating to vengeful pranks, this black farce about a pair of Los Angeles residents – played by Ali Wong and Steven Yeun – appears to be a barbed contemporary comedy, but scene by scene it goes deeper into the characters, their failings, and ultimately their connection. It is a masterful, arresting transformation.</p> <p><strong>Black Mirror</strong></p> <p>Charlie Brooker’s science-fiction anthology debuted 12 years ago, which means that some of the dystopian concepts he built each season’s handful of episodes around no longer feel like mordant speculation. But the best episodes – start with <em>San Junipero</em> – still resonate in ways both fascinating and fearful, and the show’s evolution is fascinating to trace.</p> <p><strong>Bodyguard</strong></p> <p><em>Line of Duty</em> creator Jed Mercurio pushed his talent for tense thrillers punctuated by whiplash reveals to the limits with this limited series about a British personal protection officer and traumatised war veteran (Richard Madden, in his finest performance) assigned to a hard-as-nails cabinet minister (Keeley Hawes). The dynamic between the two is one of many combustible elements here.</p> <p><strong>BoJack Horseman</strong></p> <p>Hollywood satires tend to be snarky and short-sighted, so naturally it took an animated series where the Los Angeles subjects are anthropomorphic animals to really twist the knife. Daft at first encounter, full of visual delights, and psychologically acute, the story of the titular equine sitcom star (perfectly voiced by Will Arnett) dug deeper across six seasons than most prestige dramas ever could.</p> <p><strong>Borgen</strong></p> <p>The definitive political drama of the 21st century, this Danish series originally aired for three seasons between 2010 and 2013, with its depiction of power – how to wield it, what it costs – gripping when intermixed with piquant characters. Netflix added a sharply drawn fourth season last year, and the show’s many telling observations remain relevant.</p> <p><strong>The Crown</strong></p> <p>The closer this historic drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II has got to the present day, the more its spell has dissipated. Nonetheless, Peter Morgan’s royal drama is one of Netflix’s signature shows and the Claire Foy and Olivia Colman eras as Her Majesty are sumptuous character studies of privilege, contradiction and immaculate insults.</p> <p><strong>Dark</strong></p> <p>Seriously, don’t be flippant with this dense German drama: you’re in for three seasons of increasingly complex narratives, as events in an orderly town are tied together through time travel patterns every 33 years. It is bleakly gripping – mournful cellos yes, humour no – as kidnapped children and temporal conspiracies abound, but its depiction of regret and inevitability is also tragically beautiful.</p> <p><strong>Derry Girls</strong></p> <p>Has there ever been a sitcom as silly and yet sublime as Lisa McGee’s ode to her 1990s high school misadventures in Northern Ireland during the final years of sectarian conflict. Historic events and being banned from the local chippy intertwine as a group of teenage girls – and their plus-one male English cousin – plot wildly and act badly. The funniest coming of age tale going.</p> <p><strong>The Good Place</strong></p> <p>A classic American network sitcom in structure – 22-minute episodes! – loaded with inventive ideas, ingenious gags and moral quandaries, the four seasons of this metaphysical comedy find a group of wayward strangers exploring the afterlife. It is in turn nutty, soulful, and stacked with note-perfect performances (take a bow, Ted Danson).</p> <p><strong>The Haunting of Hill House</strong></p> <p>Filmmaker turned showrunner Mike Flanagan is Netflix’s resident horror auteur: year after year he updates classic horror tales or modifies the genre. My pick of his limited series is the first, which matches a group of siblings’ haunted house experience as children with their experience as emotionally damaged adults. Much is terrifying here, including familial bonds.</p> <p><strong>Hilda</strong></p> <p>Gorgeously animated – words to the effect of “Hayao Miyazaki in Scandinavia” are rightfully found in many reviews – the two seasons of this children’s series follow the adventures of the titular 11-year-old (voiced by <em>The Last of Us</em> star Bella Ramsey). The tone can be bittersweet or chaotic, as Hilda’s outings go from the mundane to the fantastical and she begins to comprehend the wider world’s flaws.</p> <p><strong>I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson</strong></p> <p>After three seasons of this genius sketch comedy series, it’s got to the point where I laugh so uncontrollably hard that my oldest son simply calls out “Tim Robinson” from another room. Absurd but always a step ahead of your expectations, Robinson’s pieces explore the extremes of social limits.</p> <p><strong>Monty Python’s Flying Circus</strong></p> <p>Tom Robinson, and many other sketch comics, wouldn’t have a career if it wasn’t for this feted troupe of British comics. Netflix has all four seasons of their BBC show, which debuted in 1969 and paved the way for their classic film comedies, and while time and a changing society has shaded certain numbers, there is still one-of-a-kind brilliance here.</p> <p><strong>Mindhunter</strong></p> <p>When the two circles on your Venn diagram are filmmaker David Fincher and infamous serial killers of the 1970s, you’re in for an intense series. A study of detail and dread, this impeccable psychological thriller follows a pair of outlier FBI agents and a female psychology professor interviewing jailed mass murderers such as Son of Sam.</p> <p><strong>Never Have I Ever</strong></p> <p>Netflix recently wrapped up, with a satisfying mix of teenage realisation and timeless awkwardness, this coming-of-age comic-drama, as Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and her pals finished high school. Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher’s show was always funny, but it grew more perceptive about its Indian-American lead and the rigours of adolescence with each season. Bonus: an amazing celebrity narrator.</p> <p><strong>Seinfeld</strong></p> <p>The era-defining sitcoms of the 1990s are lucrative trophies in the streaming era, with Netflix currently home to all 180 episodes of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David’s celebrated comedy about a group of New Yorkers with the worst of intentions. Riffing off minor misunderstandings and friendly misdemeanours, this 20th century classic has episodes assembled with clockwork precision and hilarious send-offs.</p> <p><strong>Squid Game</strong></p> <p>The games without frontiers that punctuated this shocking and addictive drama turned Netflix’s South Korean production arm from stealth success to superstar. With a harsh undercurrent of inequality fuelling the fantastical limits, a group of strangers find themselves in an underground competition where children’s games are literally a matter of life and death.</p> <p><strong>Stateless</strong></p> <p>A funding arrangement means that Netflix ends up taking the ABC’s scripted shows to the world, while providing a valuable second chance locally. It means you can rediscover this coruscating 2020 drama about Australia’s refugee detention regime, with co-creator Cate Blanchett in a supporting role. The multiple storylines deliver startling detail and unadorned empathy.</p> <p><strong>Stranger Things</strong></p> <p>Netflix’s biggest shows – and few are bigger than this 1980s supernatural horror homage – have redefined what a successful global franchise can be. Strip-mining their favourite movies of the era, creators the Duffer Brothers created a popcorn panopticon that’s become a streaming event even as recent seasons took their time getting up to speed.</p> <p><strong>Unbelievable</strong></p> <p>Here are your truest detectives. Based on real-life events, Toni Collette and Merritt Wever are riveting as Colorado police officers who partner up to catch a serial rapist. Their relentless search is an exceptional procedural, but it’s elevated by the heart-rending parallel story of a survivor (Kaitlyn Dever) trying to endure a system meant to help her.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'The Bear’s second season is even better than the first',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><b>The Bear (season 2) ★★★★★ <br/></b>Disney+, Wednesday</p> <p>The second season of <i>The Bear</i>, the kitchen fire comic-drama about a celebrated chef trying to save both his family’s sandwich spot and himself, achieves something few shows do. It takes an acclaimed first season and furthers – and deepens – its best qualities. These 10 new episodes, which follow the Chicago neighbourhood restaurant’s fine dining rebirth, not only complement their predecessors, they serve up new insights, telling history, and unexpected paths forward. It is, like the dishes this crew aspire to make, an artisanal wonder.</p> <p>With its kitchen chaos and second-degree burn banter, the first season was about survival. The second asks what’s next? Obsessive head chef Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) wants a life of sorts – he Googles “fun” – and to break the cycle of kitchen abuse. “I’m trying to start from a healthy place,” he tells a support group, and there are strands of optimism both in and out of the kitchen. Carmy reconnects with high school classmate Claire (Molly Gordon), while flinty line cook Tina (Liza Colon-Zayas) thrives with formal training.</p> <p>Creator Christopher Storer makes exemplary use of the furious energy and grace notes thrown off by the first season. You can understand not only why the characters want to improve, but how difficult that truly is – Carmy’s fellow chef, Sydney Adamu (Ayo Edebiri), struggles to trust him because he is brilliant but wayward. The structure gives the supporting cast side mission episodes, such as gifted young pastry chef Marcus Brooks (Lionel Boyce) learning at a Noma-like restaurant in Copenhagen.</p> <p>The ticking clock remains, but now it’s the ludicrously short 12 weeks to refit The Beef and reopen as The Bear. Given the show’s dedication to capturing the culinary business, it’s a detailed whiplash experience; you will learn how crucial a “fire suppression system” is. But alongside that there are scenes that offer experience and transcendence, as when Sydney keeps visualising a meal in her head while frequenting real-life Chicago eating establishments for inspiration.</p> <p>The show’s ambitions are not minor. One episode, an hour-long flashback, sets up a Berzatto family gathering that is both captivating and terrifying. The cast is studded with name actors, who are difficult to fault individually but collectively feel a touch too much. And even then the portrait the episode paints is so valuable that you can’t fault them for going all out. “You’re going to have to care about everything more than anything,” Carmy tells Sydney. And <i>The Bear </i>is nothing if not that.</p> <p><b>Full Circle ★★★★ <br/></b>Binge</p> <p>Steven Soderbergh used to treat crime stories as a director’s magic act – he exulted in misdirection and showmanship. But the filmmaker is long past <i>Ocean’s Eleven</i> and his new limited series is about how everything unravels, most notably the lies we deceive ourselves with. Set before and after a botched kidnapping that ties together multiple strands, <i>Full Circle</i> has a churning momentum – enhanced by noir-like strings – that is gripping.</p> <p>Ed Solomon’s dense script reveals the fateful crime from high above and up close, tying together a wealthy Manhattan corporate family, including CEO Sam (Claire Danes) and her celebrity chef father Jeff (Dennis Quaid), and the naive young Guyanese men, Xavier (Sheyi Cole) and Louis (Gerald Jones), flown north to work for a Queens crime syndicate. The fallout is too heavy for anyone to not only control but even carry.</p> <p>The quirks are sharply jarring: the lead investigator, Harmony (Zazie Beetz), is driven and intuitive, but possibly also unstable – her scenes with Danes have a vivid frequency. The come-full-circle motif is plain throughout, but Soderbergh’s masterful direction and cinematography (under a pseudonym) keep the narrative rolling. The warm washes of light his characters move through remain, but they’re just momentary refuges. No one is truly safe.</p> <p><b>Sleeping Dog<br/></b>Netflix</p> <p>A knotty crime thriller by design, this six-part German mystery works best as a character study of Mike Atlas (Max Riemelt), a former police detective now living homeless on the fringes of society who must re-examine his past when an old case resurfaces and he begins to doubt his work. The plot ranges across guilt, vengeance and institutional corruption, but it’s best illustrated by the tenuous bond between Atlas and a young prosecutor, Jule Andergast (Luise von Finckh), who initially judges him by his circumstances.</p> <p><b>Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band – The Legendary 1979 No Nukes Concert<br/></b>Paramount+</p> <p>It takes a fair amount of confidence to add “legendary” to the title of your own performance, but this Madison Square Garden benefit set was for decades a revered bootleg among Bruce Springsteen fans until it got an official release in 2021. The just-released concert film backs up the self-belief: a few days shy of turning 30, Springsteen was on the cusp of becoming rock music’s central figure. A suitably ragged multi-camera shoot is all energy and outreach, complete with an unstoppable performance of <i>Born to Run</i>.</p> <p><b><i> </i></b></p> <p><b>Foundation (season 2)<br/></b>Apple TV+, Friday</p> <p>Few shows are taking as big a swing as this epic adaptation of Isaac Asimov’s canonical science-fiction novels about the millennium-long clash between a galactic Empire and the scientist who foresaw its demise. With Lee Pace and Jared Harris as adversaries, the show mostly manages to tie together personal stakes and planet-hopping history in a way that sci-fi aficionados will enjoy. Creator David S. Goyer reportedly plans eight seasons (the third is already shooting) and his approach is sound: the use of physical locations grounds the storytelling in ways green screens can’t.</p> <p><b><i> </i></b></p> <p><b>E2 Design<br/></b>Shelter</p> <p>Narrated by Brad Pitt, this succinct, informative documentary series ranges across the many applications of sustainable architecture. Without being contradictory, the narrative rewrites assumptions: the first episode explores how New York is per capita one of the greenest cities in America, because of the density of population, public transport usage, and collective consumption. In looking at Manhattan’s next generation of skyscrapers, the show details both the technical means and personal will required to improve building techniques. Subsequent episodes head to China and rural Mexico.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong>You Hurt My Feelings ★★★★</strong><br/><strong>(MA) 93 minutes</strong></p> <p>Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ athletic comic rhythm of pushiness followed by self-doubt hasn’t shifted much since her <em>Seinfeld</em> days. But in the right context her reflexes are as sharp as ever, as she shows in Nicole Holofcener’s expertly funny <em>You Hurt My Feelings</em>, which tackles many topics that might easily have been debated by the <em>Seinfeld</em> gang: when you should throw out your underwear, for instance, or the etiquette of sharing an icecream cone.</p> <p>Also in the <em>Seinfeld</em> tradition is the attention given to the minutiae of language, especially in relation to status. Is it really a compliment if you tell someone they look “adorable”, or if you describe a literary work as “pleasing”?</p> <p>Such nuances loom especially large for Louis-Dreyfus’ character Beth, a New York writing teacher who has just finished her first novel (a follow-up to her moderately successful memoir <em>I Had To Tell It</em>, which recounts her traumatic childhood history of “verbal abuse”).</p> <p>Her husband Don (Tobias Menzies) has supported her through draft after draft – but, as she discovers through an overheard conversation, the enthusiasm he expresses to her face may not be entirely genuine.</p> <p>Don, who works as a therapist, has comparable reason for unease in his own professional domain, as do Beth’s sister Sarah (Michaela Watkins) and Sarah’s husband Mark (Arian Moayed), an interior decorator and an actor respectively.</p> <p>Indeed, just about every scene in <em>You Hurt My Feelings</em> offers a new variation on the theme, with one or more of these characters forced to make the awful choice between kindness and honesty, wondering how far they’re being politely lied to in turn, or facing the challenge of dealing with negative feedback when it arrives.</p> <p>Seemingly less prone to such anxieties is Beth and Sarah’s caustic mother Georgia (the great Jeannie Berlin) whose bluntness gives a sense of where at least some of her daughters’ neuroses might have sprung from.</p> <p>As in Holofcener’s earlier comedies of manners such as <em>Friends With Money</em>, the approach here is slightly abstracted but never too heightened: the terrific actors have all come to play, but their characters aren’t reduced to pure sitcom types.</p> <p>Don’s sessions with his patients are portrayed with some realism – refreshingly, he appears to be neither great at his job nor terrible – and unlike on <em>Seinfeld</em> everyone is allowed at least the possibility of genuine psychological growth, though it’s always a matter of small steps rather than big leaps.</p> <p>To use another dubious term of praise, it’s all highly relatable, however distant you might feel from this particular social circle of well-off New Yorkers. Holofcener knows as well as anyone around how to make us cringe and laugh by turns, or simultaneously – and I’m not just saying that.</p> <p><strong><em>You Hurt My Feelings</em> is in cinemas from June 15.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i>Get The Watchlist delivered every Thursday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><strong><em>Bupkis</em>, Binge</strong><br/>★★½</p> <p>How you feel about <i>Bupkis</i> (Yiddish for “absolutely nothing”) probably depends on how you feel about its creator and star, Pete Davidson.</p> <p>As a title card and accompanying voice-over announces at the beginning of each of its eight half-hour episodes, “this program is inspired in part by real people and events” – the principal one being its co-creator, co-writer and star.</p> <p>Davidson is a former <i>Saturday Night Live</i> cast member (he joined the line-up at age 20, making him one of the youngest regulars on the sketch comedy series since its debut 48 years ago). But he’s arguably best known for his romantic entanglements with a string of high-profile women, including Ariana Grande, Kate Beckinsale (20 years his senior), Margaret Qualley (the actress daughter of Andie MacDowell) and Kim Kardashian.</p> <p>He doesn’t reference any of them directly in this series, which consists largely of aimless bits of business in and around New Jersey with his posse of kind-of-useless friends (like an east coast version of <i>Entourage</i>), punctuated with sub-Tarantinoesque dialogue about such pressing topics as the correct pronunciation of the word “cuisine”.</p> <p>But he does reference two other major points from the Davidson biography: the death of his firefighter father in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in New York; and the fact he lives with his mother Amy.</p> <p>She is played here by Edie Falco, who is easily the best thing in the show. She’s pushy, far too willing to use her son’s fame to her own advantage, and utterly disregarding of the needs of her other child, Casey.</p> <p>She is the other half of a codependent relationship whose oddness we are exposed to in the show’s opening scene when she walks in on her son masturbating while wearing a VR headset.</p> <p>It’s a grossly hilarious moment that is rarely equalled. Much of the time is spent riding around in cars with the comedian and his friends, often in a fug of marijuana smoke, rarely to much end. Occasionally, something threatens to happen; an episode set in Florida that echoes <i>Spring Breakers</i> and the <i>Fast and Furious</i> franchise promises much, but soon peters (sorry) into ridiculousness.</p> <p>You can’t fault the casting, though. Bobby Cannavale crops up as an old family friend who offers child Pete the kind of advice guaranteed to shape him as a particularly retrograde kind of young man. Steve Buscemi appears as a Catholic priest who tells him his father is still around, as a virtual reincarnation of Jesus. Joe Pesci plays the grandfather who is on his last legs, but determined to go out kicking.</p> <p>What they all have in common is that they are father substitutes for the bereft Davidson. And while that opening disclaimer adds “certain parts” of the show have been fictionalised “solely for dramatic purposes and are not intended to reflect on any actual person or entity”, this bit at least rings true. Davidson is a sad clown, haunted equally by the absence of his father and the overbearing presence of his mother.</p> <p>That gives it a certain pathetic dramatic quality, but as comedy, it’s kinda bupkis.</p> <p><b><strong>Find more of the author’s work <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/by/karl-quinn-hvecw\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

       "   'description': '<p>Australia’s top chief executives almost unanimously expect the domestic economy to skirt a recession next year despite lingering inflation, pressure on household budgets and the prospect of a long monetary pause.</p> <p>CEOs from the banking, mining, retail, property and industrials sectors expect Australia’s economy to slow in the coming year, which along with cost pressures could mean a tougher 2024 for business and pressure on planned investment.</p> <p>“We’re likely to avoid a hard landing in 2024,” Goodman Group founder and CEO Greg Goodman said.</p> <p>“It’s also likely that inflation will keep slowing as a result of the interest rate rises we’ve seen. The business climate is, however, going to be more difficult, with spending more subdued.”</p> <p>Macquarie Group’s Shemara Wikramanayake said Australia’s immigration profile and strength in key industries should keep the country out of recession in 2024; however, slower economic growth should bring inflation back to the Reserve Bank’s targeted range by the end of the year.</p> <p>“Broad-based inflationary pressures, driven by relatively strong economic demand and a tight labour market, will likely abate in the face of this slower growth,” Ms Wikramanayake said.</p> <p>Commonwealth Bank boss Matt Comyn said there was only low risk of a recession next year, although that would increase should high inflation persist and the RBA needed to increase official interest rates further.</p> <p>“Given the sharp rise in interest rates over the past 18 months, we think we are at, or very close to, the top of the current rate cycle,” Mr Comyn said.</p> <p>The comments were made as part of <em>The Australian Financial Review</em>’s annual Chanticleer survey of more than 50 top ASX CEOs. Nearly all said higher interest rates and inflation were likely to slow growth; however, they pointed to immigration and infrastructure spending as reasons why Australia would avoid a recession.</p> <p>Wesfarmers CEO Rob Scott said the homegrown cost pressures, including staff costs and raw materials, were the “greatest challenge to inflation” in the coming year.</p> <p>“We are seeing significant increases in supply chain costs, wages, power and other services,” said Mr Scott, whose company owns hardware retailer Bunnings Warehouse, discount retailer Kmart and a big industrials chemicals business.</p> <p>“There are risks of further pressures in 2024 with additional regulation and compliance costs, and less flexibility in the workplace to adjust to dynamic changes in the market will ultimately increase costs if we are not careful.”</p> <p>CEOs with consumer-facing businesses said cost-of-living pressures would keep customers rethinking their spending habits and choices. Even so, they kept referring to the economy as “resilient”.</p> <p>“I think most people have been surprised at how resilient the economy has been this year in spite of global shocks and interest rate hikes, so we’re cautiously optimistic that resilience continues,” said Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson, who took over from Alan Joyce in September.</p> <p>“What we’re seeing is that demand across Jetstar and Qantas remains above pre-COVID levels, despite cost-of-living pressures.”</p> <p>Coles CEO Leah Weckert, also new to her role, agreed customers were feeling the fiscal pinch: “Overall, we are optimistic about the resilience of the Australian economy and, in particular, non-discretionary sectors like supermarkets,” she said.</p> <p>Woolworths’ Brad Banducci was reluctant to make any economic predictions, but said the government’s revised approach to skilled migration had helped address labour shortages that should ease cost pressures in the economy.</p> <p>“It will allow Australia to better attract the talent we need to fill critical skills gaps and labour shortages across the economy, in turn supporting productivity growth,” Mr Banducci said.</p> <p>“The ‘Skills In Demand’ visa is a big step forward and will help bring experts with emerging skills and expertise into Australia to help train and develop local team members.”</p> <p>Elliott Rusanow, who runs Westfield owner Scentre Group and is a major landlord to the likes of Coles and Woolworths, said consumers were still spending up big at the shops.</p> <p>“When you look at the consumer, aggregate consumer spending is also high,” Mr Rusanow said. “We’re seeing this play out in our business partner sales which are at record levels.”</p> <p>Seven Group’s Ryan Stokes was one of only a few outliers who said there was a “high risk” of a hard economic landing and there was little room for further interest rate tightening.</p> <p>“The resilience shown to date can only withstand so many shocks inflicted by the RBA,” Mr Stokes said.</p> <p>“The RBA’s approach to the cash rate will eventually trigger the economic contraction they are targeting ... In short, rates have already moved too far too quickly. Patience needs to be demonstrated. Further rate increases are not required in the near term.”</p> <p>Newmont CEO Tom Palmer, an Australian whose company bought Australia’s biggest listed goldminer Newcrest Mining this year, said it was too early to declare victory in the fight against inflation.</p> <p>“Until there is a sustained and honest effort to increase productivity in Australia through genuine reform, the RBA has little option but to use the blunt instrument of cash rate increases to try and reduce inflation,” Mr Palmer said.</p> <p><em>With Ciara Seccombe and Edmund Tadros</em></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>Seven high-profile Australian men share the best advice their fathers gave them, and how that’s played out in the way they live.</p> <h3>Cameron Daddo, Smooth FM announcer</h3> <p>Dad [Peter] told me I should learn about money so I enrolled in a finance course but lasted 18 months. I wanted to be in entertainment. Dad helped negotiate my first TV contract. He put them over the griller and got me a decent deal. He has great business acumen and is a people person. His advice? Know how to back yourself. Another key moment was when my wife Alison’s home birth with our third child went pear-shaped. As I left for hospital, Dad grabbed me and said “take care of your family”. Those words resonated; I’d been strongly influenced by people outside the family on how to raise one. A few years later, I got a bad review for a theatre show. Dad told me it takes more balls to do what I did than to be the person reviewing.</p> <h3>Tim Rogers, Musician</h3> <p>My dad, Adrian, gave advice by his actions rather than his words. He was a kind and patient man and that made a huge impression on me. He never raised his voice and always tried to make someone’s job easier – whether at his work or in the hospitality industry, he was nice to everyone. He worked in engineering and mining, and was involved in local sporting teams. I never heard him get swept up in politics. He was the quiet type, which could be infuriating at times, though I found his ability to remain calm quite impressive – he knew the value of silence. I found out 13 years ago he was adopted. I asked him why he never told me. He replied, “You never asked.” Dad died two years ago and I couldn’t get to his funeral due to the lockdown.</p> <h3>Max Gawn, Melbourne AFL player and Lululemon ambassador</h3> <p>My dad, Rob, has never missed a game of footy ever since I started playing under 9s, including 15 years of me playing AFL, except when he couldn’t get to Perth when we won the grand final in 2021. He doesn’t know much about footy but always has advice after a game! Perhaps the most memorable advice he gave was when I got my driving licence: “Treat every other driver on the road like an idiot.” I have always remembered that and haven’t had a crash. Dad is good at letting me be me, and I am taking that approach into fatherhood. Dad came to Australia with Mum and my two older brothers from NZ. I was born here. I saw what he did by way of example – being a hard-working man – and I have applied that to what I do.</p> <h3>Jamie Durie, Gardening expert and collaborator with Gus Modern</h3> <p>The best advice my dad, Dave, gave me was to “get a trade behind you, son”. I did that with my four years of study in horticulture and it was the best thing I ever did. Little did I know it would put me into the position of taping 56 lifestyle TV shows, hosting <em>The Block</em> for the first two seasons, doing <em>Backyard Blitz</em> for eight, winning seven Logie Awards, authoring 14 books and securing a five-year contract with Oprah Winfrey. I had no plans to be on TV. It all happened by accident. Had I not learnt the basics and crafted my expertise in design and horticulture with that plant knowledge, there is no way I would have been on TV. Dad’s advice is the best anyone has given me. He’s been an incredible father to me my entire life, and still is.</p> <h3>Costa Georgiadis, Host of <em>Gardening Australia</em></h3> <p>My dad, Stanley, was an incredible individual – incredibly strong, not just physically but mentally. He had a clear and simple approach when doing things – if you do it, do it right. His advice was to be focused on what you’re doing. The Mr Miyagi moment for me as a kid was when he used to make me vacuum the pool. The vacuum cleaner was only 400 millimetres wide and the pool was 10 metres long. You had to move slowly. If you went fast, you’d stir up the dust and make a bigger job for yourself. He’d say, “Not good enough, do it again.” Dad taught me to be focused. Now, if I am doing a task, I stay in the moment. I carry that presence of mind and action because of Dad. That’s an incredible gift he gave – to have pride in your work.</p> <h3>Curtis Stone, Celebrity chef</h3> <p>My dad, Bryan, was a finance manager and always gave me good business advice. He is quite conservative, and told me to work hard and save money and not take too many chances. I think that stood me in good stead, even though I didn’t listen to him all the time. He had high expectations but wasn’t unrealistic; if you made a mistake, he gave you a chance to fix things. I felt his advice most through my teenage years – he was at every sporting event I played. It’s that stability and assurance that has played out well for me because I saw him not overreact and just deal with things when they didn’t go right. He taught me how to be balanced in tough situations. I am more of a risk-taker than he was and still have a great relationship with him.</p> <h3>Craig Foster, Commentator and former Socceroo</h3> <p>We grew up in a working class, sport-oriented family in Lismore, NSW. Dad [Kevin] was a competitive cricketer and tennis player. He didn’t give advice by way of expressing or dictating it. It was the way Dad conducted himself and treated his three sons and people outside the family that spoke louder than words. Dad was a motor mechanic who ran his own business. He had a fierce belief in fairness. If someone was disadvantaged or couldn’t pay for a repair, he would often fix it for nothing. We all played sport professionally and he told us to treat players equally. He said the better you do and the higher you go, the humbler you should be. That you are no more special than other people. Dad had an inclusive nature and it rubbed off on us.</p> <p><b><i>Make the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our</i></b><b><i> Live Well newsletter</i></b><b><i>. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56j6k\" target=\"_blank\">Get it in your inbox</a> every Monday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'What would Agatha Christie make of this not-so-cosy mystery?',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><strong>CRIME FICTION</strong><br/><em><strong>Death in the Sauna</strong></em><br/><strong>Dennis Altman</strong><br/><strong>Clouds of Magellan Press, $34.99</strong></p> <p>It’s leather night at Spartacus, a discreet London sauna that is a meeting place for gay men. It’s also two days before a Global AIDS Conference, and Pomfrey Lister, the eminent virologist, founder and President of the Global AIDS Trust, is lying naked and serenely dead in a cubicle with a half empty bottle of amyl nitrate in his hand. So begins Dennis Altman’s elegant whodunnit in which everyone, in true Agatha Christie mode, is a suspect.</p> <p>The author of <em>Homosexual: Oppression and Liberation</em>, first published in 1971, Altman is a distinguished academic who has himself served on the board of many AIDS initiatives across the world. Here he draws on that experience to present a wry, poignant, restrained murder mystery that unfolds against the backdrop of a major AIDS convention in 2003. In relation to which, there’s some amusing asides about the minor royal who opens the event who would clearly much rather be at Wimbledon, and the missing wife of a central Asian despot who went shopping two days earlier and hasn’t been seen since.</p> <p>Sadly, the man who might have managed these various hiccups is now dead. Summoned to the sauna, Pomfrey’s colleague and rival for control of the Trust, Spencer Carson, thinks it would be much better if Pomfrey were discovered at home, in bed, dead of a massive heart attack.</p> <p>So does Mary, Pomfrey’s wife, who has yet to come to terms with her husband’s double life, and so Pomfrey’s body is immediately relocated and quickly cremated. But there are suspicions.</p> <p>The unlikely sleuth in this telling tale is Noel, Pomfrey’s former lover. A mild-mannered second-hand bookseller, Noel just happened to spot Pomfrey’s bright red Bentley outside Spartacus on the night in question and suspects Pomfrey was cheating on him. For his own peace of mind, Noel needs to know. He thought they had made a commitment.</p> <p>After teaming up with Sylvie, Pomfrey’s former assistant, who incidentally collects early editions of Agatha Christie novels, Noel embarks on a quest to determine Pomfrey’s fidelity, or not. Searching for the attendant who first discovered his lover’s body, Noel heads to Brighton. There he stays in the rather shabby gay bed and breakfast establishment, Brigadoon, run by the irrepressible Maurice who is rehearsing for the role of Miss Prism in the Brighton Wilde Players production of<em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>.</p> <p>What is so endearing and engaging about Altman’s first crime novel is that all the characters, however minor, have intricate lives and backstories that render them profoundly human, even if their motives and actions might be questionable. Take Mary, Pomfrey’s widow, who bears “a slight resemblance to Judi Dench”. Her AIDS work in Africa involving virginity and abstinence is based on her belief that sex is the cause “of so much misery.” No wonder Pomfrey strayed.</p> <p>Altman’s touch is deft and his wit razor sharp. Agatha would have surely approved, but I’m not sure what she would have made of leather night at Spartacus.</p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'How Patricia Field ‘reunited’ Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>Fashion can be a unifying force. Want proof? Patricia Field, the veteran film and television costume director, arguably most famous for her work on <em>Sex and the City</em>, managed to do what Hollywood could not – bring feuding actresses Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall to the same screen.</p> <p>Both stars of <em>Sex and the City</em> appear in a new biopic, <em>Happy Clothes: A Film About Patricia Field</em>, with several scenes showing Cattrall and Field cavorting around Manhattan.</p> <p>The two became close during <em>SATC</em> and Field now works on Cattrall’s latest show, <em>Glamorous</em>, in which she plays a supermodel turned beauty mogul – a kind of <em>Devil Wears Prada</em> (another credit that earned Field an Oscar nomination) meets the cosmetics industry.</p> <p>So strong is the bond between the women that Cattrall only agreed to make a cameo on <em>Sex and the City</em> sequel <em>And Just Like That </em>if Field dressed her (Field turned down <em>AJLT</em> due to scheduling clashes with filming for <em>Emily in Paris; </em>the show’s costumes are directed by Molly Rogers, Field’s right hand on <em>SATC</em>, and Danny Santiago).</p> <p>Field, 81, says via Zoom that she had been approached numerous times over the years about making a documentary, but it wasn’t until director Michael Selditch ambushed her with a “sizzle reel” that she agreed. Fame, she says in an early scene in <em>Happy Clothes,</em> doesn’t sit naturally with her.</p> <p>“I’m in over my head. All of a sudden, I became this famous person. I worked, and enjoyed the work, for years but, somehow, recognition found me and in a certain way, I’m a little nervous about it,” she says while puffing on a cigarette – a Field trademark as ubiquitous as her cherry red hair and thick-rimmed glasses.</p> <p>The film’s title is a direct quote from Field, a self-described “exaggeration queen” who often pairs seemingly incongruous combinations on screen – clashing colours, prints and silhouettes – to create a surprising seamlessness.</p> <p>It’s how one of <em>SATC’s</em> most famous outfits – Parker, as Carrie Bradshaw, wearing a tutu on the streets of Manhattan in the opening credits – came to be, even if the show’s creator, Darren Star, didn’t fully comprehend it at first.</p> <p>“I said, ‘You know, Darren, this is not something trendy, this is something that will last forever, and stay fresh’,” Field says.</p> <p>And it worked. Fans of the show still buy $US140 ($210) replicas of the tutu – Parker has the original – from Field’s gallery in Lower Manhattan, a more sedate space than the store she ran for nearly 50 years, which in the 1980s was a hangout for artists, club kids and future celebrities, including RuPaul and Laverne Cox (John F. Kennedy Jr was reportedly barred once for making anti-trans slurs about the patrons).</p> <p>It was also where a young Selditch spent time, but it was only while making the 2019 documentary <em>American Style</em> that he zeroed on in on Field as a documentary subject.</p> <p>The film’s opening scene, which shows Field swimming in a pool covered in tiled mosaics, was designed to surprise. “I wanted people to be in the theatre wondering, ‘Am I in the right [movie]?’” he says.</p> <p>“Yeah, maybe they would anticipate the opening scene would be, like, at a fashion show,” Field adds.</p> <p>Instead, <em>Happy Clothes</em> takes the viewer inside Field’s “process”, scouring vintage fairs for <em>tchotchkes</em>, and to fittings with the cast of <em>Run the World</em>, billed as an all-black <em>SATC</em>. Through these snippets, we’re given a taste of some of Field’s mantras – “As long as the colours match, you can f–k around with the patterns” – and her views on modern style.</p> <p>“Today the fashion is so depressing,” she says in the film, later explaining she has grown bored by the overwhelming uniformity of dressing.</p> <p>“What I call ‘depression wear’ fashion, as opposed to ‘celebratory fashion’ ... Fashion definitely is a reflection of the time that we are living in,” she says.</p> <p>“I use the example of the 1920s – people were celebratory ... These days it’s more, I don’t know why, but maybe people feel getting overdressed isn’t cool.”</p> <p>For Field, there ain’t no such thing.</p> <p><em><strong>Happy Clothes: A Film About Patricia Field</strong></em><strong> screens at the Melbourne International Film Festival on August 5, 7 and 19. miff.com.au. <em>The Age</em> is a festival media partner.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Make the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our</i></b><b><i> Live Well newsletter</i></b><b><i>. </i></b><b><i>Get it in your inbox every Monday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p>As Fashion Week kicks off in Sydney, fashionistas have a new hotel to put on their bucket-list.</p> <p>The late Karl Lagerfeld’s biggest and final hospitality project, a luxurious 271-room Macau hotel, will officially launch in June – nine years after it was first announced.</p> <p>The Karl Lagerfeld Hotel, which began welcoming guests on April 29, is part of The Grand Lisboa Palace Resort Macau and will be the world’s only hotel designed entirely by the fashion great. Lagerfeld died in 2019 age 85, four years before his vision was brought to life.</p> <p>Everything from the large-scale installations to the bathrobes and bedsheets have been touched with the designer’s creative flare. Room rates start from about 1949 Macanese Pataca ($360) a night.</p> <p>The opulent stay will feature Portuguese celebrity chef Jose Avillez’s restaurant Mesa; a palatial book lounge containing 4000 carefully selected books, displayed majestically across multiple custom wall installations; and a lavish spa and wellness centre with indoor and outdoor pools.</p> <p>Lagerfeld drew on modern chinoiserie design elements when crafting the 271 rooms and suites, which weave Chinese symbols and silhouettes with Western aesthetics. Custom-made round silver and gold headboards take inspiration from Chinese coins, to signal prosperity, while circular room dividers are reminiscent of classic Chinese moon gates.</p> <p>A moody palette of black, gold and crimson features throughout the property’s rooms and public spaces; noticeably absent is the colour pink, which Lagerfeld famously believed wasn’t “flattering” on anyone. Fashion writer Patrick Mauries credited the designer as once saying: “Think pink. But don’t wear it.”</p> <p>Lagerfeld collaborated with Italian design lighting brand Terzani, Dutch artist Marcel Wanders and French artist Jean-Michel Othoniel to create a number of commissioned works, including chandeliers, furnishings and sculptures.</p> <p>It’s the latest property by SJM Resorts, whose stable of brands include Palazzo Versace Macau, Grand Lisboa and Ponte 16.</p> <p>The former Chanel creative director worked with SJM on the hotel’s design for many years prior to his death in 2019.</p> <p>The hotel launch comes on the back of <em>Vogue</em>’s annual Met Gala, which was themed this year “In Honour of Karl”, in tribute to the late German designer’s extensive body of work in fashion. The theme <a href=\"http://p5cvwp\" target=\"_blank\">drew criticism from activists</a> due to Lagerfeld’s legacy of fat-phobic, sexist and homophobic comments, including such comments as “These are fat mummies sitting with their bags of crisps in front of the television, saying that thin models are ugly,” and “If you don’t want your pants pulled about, don’t become a model!”</p> <p>See <a href=\"https://www.thekarllagerfeld.mo/en\" target=\"_blank\">thekarllagerfeld.mo/en</a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Wrenching Canadian comedy keeps a step ahead of our expectations',\n",
       "   'description': '<p><b>Sort Of (season 3) ★★★★½ <br/></b>Stan</p> <p>Now that its third and final season has arrived, it’s time to celebrate this sometimes wrenching Canadian comedy as one of the best, albeit consistently under-rated, series of the past few years. A show whose central character always felt a step behind in their own life, <i>Sort Of</i> is by contrast always a step ahead of audience expectations: emotionally genuine when melodrama would have been easier, wittily telling when farce would have sufficed. Weighed together, these succinct episodes carry more than anyone might have predicted.</p> <p>Set in Toronto, <i>Sort Of</i> was heralded on arrival for its firsts: co-creator Bilal Baig is queer, gender-fluid and Muslim, as is the character they play, Sabi Mehboob, the child of Pakistani immigrants coming to grips with who they want to be. But identity doesn’t lead to overt politics, instead Baig and co-creator Fab Filippo ground Sabi in intimacy. Sabi’s own steps in the first season are hesitant, but they are terrific as part-time nanny to a pair of children from a progressive household.</p> <p>The vicissitudes of family, whether in the form of blood relatives or those we choose to love, is a recurring focus on the show. Sabi’s various clans overlap so that there is a mutual attraction with the mother of their wards, Bessy (Grace Lynn Kung), even as Sabi has to contend with their increasingly exasperated sister, Aqsa (Supinder Wraich), before showing their true self to their mother, Raffo (Ellora Patnaik) in the first season, then their traditional father, Imran (Dhirendra), the following season.</p> <p>The third season finds Sabi still struggling with their relationships, but taking the decisive step of beginning hormone replacement therapy. One of the best qualities in this series is its refusal to accept a comfortable stasis: circumstance and realisation lead the characters forward. Sabi starts an impossibly hip business with their best friend, 7ven (Amanda Cordner), deals with questionable attractions, and finds a bond with Bessy’s husband, Paul (Gray Powell), the literal straight man in an enthusiastically transgender milieu.</p> <p>As writers, Baig and Filippo have a terrific touch: the children, for example, never play cute, but their queries have an unadorned, clarifying force, whether to Sabi or their parents. A single 22-minute episode might wrestle with unspoken trauma, offer some snippy anthropological insight from an unfiltered 7ven, a shot of sitcom silliness, and capture unexpected consolation. A cult success outside Canada, <i>Sort Of</i> is a model not just of screen diversity, but also how a deeply specific character can resonate in unexpected and immersive ways. This show will be missed.</p> <p><b>Mike Birbiglia: The Old Man and the Pool ★★★½ <br/></b>Netflix</p> <p>While this special has the familiar aesthetic of a stand-up gig, right down to the establishing shots of the audience filing into a theatre at New York’s Lincoln Centre, Mike Birbiglia is not a stand-up comedian. He’s a long-form storyteller who accumulates gags, a monologue artist who controls the flow of his performance with accomplished precision. Birbiglia doesn’t freelance from his script, or sputter with manic energy.</p> <p>It’s an approach that suits his observational style, which once again alights on the mysteries of his misbehaving body. When he fails a simple pulmonary test at his annual check-up, Birbiglia butts up against existential fears. He’s in his mid-40s and his father and paternal grandfather both died from heart attacks at age 56. “I think that might be a big year for me,” he notes, his signature wry self-deprecation surfacing.</p> <p>With short story-like digressions, such as a recounting of his failed high school wrestling career, the narrative follows Birbiglia’s quest to improve his health – the swimming pool is his doctor’s cardio suggestion – while communicating his concerns to his family and reappraising his childhood. Choice phrases are casually dropped, only to reappear with added profundity, and Birbiglia’s ease means that you don’t grow tired of his voice as the punchlines add up. There is, happily, plenty of life left in him yet.</p> <p><b>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters<br/></b>Apple TV+</p> <p>While this spin-off series has to accommodate a recent blockbuster revival of <i>Godzilla</i> movies, it does a good job of establishing its own identity as a youthful mystery set in 2015 as the world gets to grips with the emergence of giant creatures alternating with a 1950s backstory that sets up the mysterious organisation – Monarch – secretly researching them. The link is father and son Kurt and Wyatt Russell playing the same character in different eras, while the pay-off is the sizable digital effects budget that captures the vast scale of the many monsters.</p> <p><b>Plausible Deniability<br/></b>Facebook</p> <p>An independent Australian short-form comedy supported by Screen Australia and comprised of six 10-minute episodes, this barbed commentary on image-washing has a trio of 11-year-olds – played with instinctive timing by Naomi Ejigu, Mae White, and Lennox Lee – interviewing prominent figures for a school documentary about homelessness. Whether it’s a scandal-plagued footballer, social media influencer or church leader, the children’s straight questions soon expose the platitudes of their guests. Available via Facebook, Iain Crittenden’s satire has farcical rhythms and a knowing undertow: the young students don’t get what they expected, but they learn a great deal.</p> <p><b>Quiz Lady<br/></b>Disney+</p> <p>There’s a smart casting twist to this modestly enjoyable comedy about a pair of mismatched sisters thrown back together by their absent mother’s gambling debts: Sandra Oh plays against type as the unpredictable whirlwind Jenny, while Awkwafina is the stressed-out and straitlaced Anne. A circuitous plot has them looking for financial salvation (and a kidnapped dog) via the latter besting her nerves and going on her favourite quiz show, but Jessica Yu’s film is really an examination of the fractious sibling bond and the unexpected lines we hold family members to.</p> <p><b>Takeshi’s Castle<br/></b>Amazon Prime</p> <p>A cartoonish Japanese mix of <i>American Gladiators</i> and <i>It’s a Knockout</i>, this Japanese game show was a cultural oddity when first sighted in the 1980s – the late Clive James went on it as a contestant as part of a documentary about life in Japan. This loving reboot doesn’t feature much of original host Takeshi Kitano, who is better known internationally as a filmmaker and actor, but it’s full of giddy energy, wacky physical challenges, and deliberately cheap costumes.

Turns out, they do it all the time “as part of getting the audience mix right”, a spokesperson told us.</p> <p>We had other questions, too, like why did people in Brighton — where the median weekly income is nearly 1000 bucks higher than the state’s average, and which has three train stations — need help getting into the city?

       "   'headline': 'Think Biden is too old to run for president again? No, he’s feeling sprightly',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>There is growing expectation in Washington that, in coming weeks, President Joe Biden will announce that he will seek a second term in the White House.</p> <p>It is only because of Biden’s age that there has ever been any doubt about whether he would run again. The president turned 80 on November 20; were he to serve another term he would be 86 when he left office in January 2029. Yet, health permitting, there is no reason not to expect him to do so.</p> <p>Since the 22nd amendment to the US Constitution which imposes a two-term limit on the Presidency came into force in 1951, every incumbent American president has sought a second term. Six have been successful: Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, George W Bush and Obama. Four have failed: Ford, Carter, George H W Bush and Trump. Lyndon Johnson is difficult to classify: he was re-elected in 1964 having been in office for a year following the Kennedy assassination. Although ultimately he did not run again in 1968, he had every intention to do so, and only withdrew when he was pushed close to defeat in the New Hampshire primary. Kennedy himself made his fatal trip to Texas in November 1963 to lay the foundations for his re-election bid in 1964, which he would almost certainly have won.</p> <p>Nevertheless, no incumbent has been as old as Biden. Will his age make the difference? Subject, always, to the caveat of his health, I doubt it. In Australia, we are accustomed to the idea that even long political careers end in their 60s (if not earlier). Not so in the United States.</p> <p>When considering whether Biden would see his age as an impediment, it is instructive to consider the institution which shaped him: the US Senate. It was designed by the framers of the Constitution to be a body of wise elders (hence the Constitution prescribes a minimum age limit of 30). The etymology of the very word “Senate” is the Latin “senex” (old man). When Americans say “elder statesmen”, they really mean it. It is not uncommon for senators to serve into their 80s, in some cases their 90s.</p> <p>Among the senators elected in last year’s mid-terms was Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, commencing his eighth six-year term at the age of 89. (Grassley has served continuously in elected office, as a State legislator, Congressman and Senator since he was first elected to the Iowa House of Representatives in 1959.) Biden served in the Senate with Grassley for 28 years. His other former Senate colleagues included Orrin Hatch of Utah (who retired after 42 years at the age of 86), Ted Stevens of Alaska (who also served for 42 years until he reached 87), Daniel Inouye of Hawaii (who died in office in 2012 at the age of 88, a fortnight before his 50th anniversary), and Dianne Feinstein of California (incumbent, who turns 90 in June and has not ruled out running again in 2024). But the greatest of them all – at least in terms of longevity – was the legendary <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/champion-of-us-segregation-fathered-mixed-race-daughter-20031215-gdhzi0.html\" target=\"_blank\">Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who died in June 2003 at the age of 100</a>, having retired from the Senate only five months earlier after 48 years’ service. Thurmond began his public life in the South Carolina Senate in 1933; his continuous political service lasted one week short of 70 years.</p> <p>Had Biden not been tapped by Obama in 2008 to be his running-mate, he would very likely still be the senior senator for Delaware – and, like those and others of his senatorial colleagues, he would no doubt be planning to continue. Biden’s long service as a senator is key to understanding his future plans, because we are all shaped by the institutions in which we have our careers. In Biden’s case, it is the Senate, where age confers status, longevity enhances power, and being an octogenarian is no problem at all.</p> <p>Add to that the fact that politics is all Biden has ever done. He was first elected to the Senate half a century ago, in 1972. He was just 29; he was only constitutionally eligible because his 30th birthday fell between his election and the start of his term. He has been a senior political figure ever since. The only time in the last 50 years he has not held elected office was during the Trump presidency; during those four years he devoted himself full-time to running for president.</p> <p>Many US presidents come to the office having made their name outside politics: Wilson (university president), Eisenhower (general), Reagan (film star), the first Bush (businessman) and Trump (property developer and television “personality”). Quite a few have come to Washington from Governor’s mansions: FDR, Carter, Reagan, Clinton and the second Bush. Biden is not one of those. He has no interesting professional hinterland. His entire professional life has been spent as a Washington insider. Nor does he appear to have any interests outside politics: he is an entirely one-dimensional inside-the-Beltway politician.</p> <p>Historical precedent, institutional culture and life story aside, there is one other powerful reason why I expect Biden will decide to run again. He believes he can win. Should he decide to run, he is unlikely to face a primary challenger. Kamala Harris, foisted upon him by the Obamas and generally considered the least effective vice president since Dan Quayle, is no threat at all, nor is any other senior Democrat.</p> <p>With the nomination in the bag, he will face one of three scenarios: his opponent will either be Trump, a Trump surrogate, or a Republican who beats the Trump machine. If it is either of the first two, the mid-terms give Biden every reason to be confident of winning. If it is the latter, expect the MAGA Republicans to run a spoiler candidate to destroy the official nominee’s chances, just as George H W Bush’s re-election was derailed in 1992 by the insurgent campaign of Ross Perot.</p> <p>As he surveys the wreckage wrought upon the Republican Party by Donald Trump, Joe Biden must scarcely be able to believe his luck. And if ever, in a nostalgic moment, he casts his eye down Pennsylvania Avenue towards the institution which shaped him and in which he served for more than half his adult life, he must feel positively sprightly.</p> <p><strong>George Brandis was a Senator for Queensland from 2000 - 2018 and Leader of the Government in the Senate in the Turnbull Government.</strong></p> <p><b><i>The Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own. </i></b><b><i>Sign up here</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p> <h3><b>More world commentary from our acclaimed writers</b></h3> <p><b>Weapons of choice:</b> We may not be at war, but Australia has some tough lessons to learn from Ukraine about what we need to prioritise and prepare in case we do go to war - <em>Mick Ryan</em></p> <p><b>The US/ Australia alliance:</b> There’s a new head of the US Studies Centre in Sydney, and this Republican has a few things he wants Australians to know about the reality of their relationship with the US - <em>Peter Hartcher</em></p> <p><b>Long term gain:</b> Recent headlines suggest that far-right populism is on the decline, but that would be short-sighted and dangerous to conclude.

       "   'headline': 'Hitchcock to Meryl Streep: The Hollywood history that’s full of juicy tales',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>In <em>Gigi</em>, Vincente Minnelli’s stylish 1958 musical, Honore (Maurice Chevalier) and former lover Madame Alvarez (Hermione Gingold) are reminiscing about the good old days. Cue: Lerner and Loewe’s witty<em> I Remember It Well</em>.</p> <p>Honore sings, “We met at nine.” “We met at eight,” Madame Alvarez corrects. “I was on time,” he continues. “No, you were late,” she responds. The song’s title is clearly ironic, and it’s surely no coincidence that, 16 years later, when Minnelli published his autobiography, largely about his time in Hollywood, he called it <em>I Remember It Well</em>. Acknowledging that maybe he didn’t.</p> <p>Sam Wasson and Jeanine Basinger’s 750-page oral history about Hollywood never directly addresses the question of how well those it cites might remember their time in Tinseltown. But it’s everywhere implicit: in the often contradictory viewpoints they offer about what it was, and is now, like; and in the way apocryphal anecdotes frequently sit side-by-side with much more plausible historical information.</p> <p>Veteran assistant director Ridgeway Callow delivers an amusing yarn about director Cecil B. DeMille, known for his serious approach to his work and for his autocratic dealings with extras for crowd scenes in big-budget films, from <em>King of Kings</em> (1927) to <em>The Ten Commandments</em> (1956).</p> <p>“One day, he caught an extra on set talking to her friend. ‘When I’m talking, young lady, what do you have to say that’s so important?’ The girl in question was a well-known extra by the name of Sugar Geise, an ex-showgirl and a great wit. Bravely, she spoke up. ‘I only said to my friend, When is that bald-headed son-of-a-bitch going to call lunch?’ There were a few apprehensive seconds of silence. Then Mr. DeMille yelled, ‘Lunch!’ So, he did have a sense of humour.”</p> <p>The story might be true, but Callow never worked with DeMille (and I can find no record of Geise ever having done so either), so it’s highly likely that he’s passing on an anecdote he’s heard from somebody else. Which might or might not be true, however much one wants it to be.</p> <p>Alongside it, <em>Hollywood</em> places the more reliable memories of some who did work with DeMille, including Charlton Heston, Edith Head and cinematographer Hal Rosson, as well as others who could speak with some authority about his standing in the film business, including fellow directors Allan Dwan, Tay Garnett and Mervyn LeRoy, and publicist Teete Carle.</p> <p><em>Hollywood: The Oral History</em> is full of often juicy and frequently informative stories about the place, mostly told by people who have worked there. It takes us from the era of the silents through to the present day, patiently guiding us across that very unsteady footbridge between the old Hollywood and the new one. And it’s an impressively ambitious endeavour, drawing creatively on the wonderful collection of material that came from the vaults of the American Film Institute.</p> <p>Wasson, the author of a handful of books about Hollywood – on Blake Edwards, Audrey Hepburn, Paul Mazursky, Bob Fosse, and <em>Chinatown</em> – had the original idea. He took it to Jeanine Basinger, his former lecturer in film studies at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, the author of a dozen books about the movies – their subjects include Shirley Temple, Gene Kelly, director Anthony Mann, the war movie and the musical – and a trustee at the AFI.</p> <p>With the institute’s approval, they gained access to 3000 guest speakers and nearly 10,000 hours of “intimate conversations between Hollywood professionals and AFI conservatory students”.</p> <p>These aren’t the kind of interviews people involved in the industry generally do when they’re trying to sell us something. They were exchanges in which they were able to speak freely and openly about their work, taking us behind the scenes to provide insights into the joys and the pitfalls that have been a daily part of their work and to what the late producer Joseph E. Levine delightfully refers to as the “<em>farkakte</em>” film business.</p> <p>Selected parts of these conversations are arranged more or less chronologically, Wasson recently telling <em>Vanity Fair</em>, “What we wanted to do was make it like a real conversation. So, we wanted it to be like Lillian Gish is in the room with Jordan Peele. And the way that we achieve that is by having people finish each other’s thoughts. It is one long conversation.”</p> <p>It was also a mammoth task to edit all the material together, although, curiously, the credits to the book have Wasson and Basinger as authors rather than editors. Along with a few other film commentators – critics, historians and journalists – they do make guest appearances from time to time. But it has to be said that we could generally have done without their interruptions. They add little to what we’re able to glean from what the speakers have already or are soon to say.</p> <p>The cast list is extensive. There are “old-timers” who have gone on ahead, such as directors Raoul Walsh, Frank Capra, Alfred Hitchcock, King Vidor, Billy Wilder, Rouben Mamoulian and John Cromwell, producers Henry Blanke, Pandro Berman and Arthur Freed, actors Henry Fonda, Gene Kelly, Bette Davis, cinematographers Stanley Cortez, Floyd Crosby and Hal Mohr, as well as many others.</p> <p>There’s also an abundance of comparatively new kids on the block, some of whom will need no introduction – Lucas, Spielberg, Beatty, Cameron, Scorsese, John Lasseter, JJ Abrams, Streep, Nicholson – and others who might, such as agent Michael Ovitz and producer Sherry Lansing. Two actors have their names misspelt (Margaret Sullavan and Joseph Cotten), and script continuity assistant Hannah Scheel (<em>Blow Out</em>) mysteriously appears to have become Hannah Sheeld, but these are minor blemishes.</p> <p>However, to claim that the book is <em>the</em> oral history is a bit over the top. There are thousands upon thousands of stories that aren’t told here, thousands of people who didn’t contribute to its history. And the puzzling editorial decision not to provide a detailed index or information about exactly where the participants sit in the epic saga of Hollywood results in an approximate history rather than a precise one.</p> <p>That said, though, the talk in <em>Hollywood</em> is often illuminating, consistently interesting and frequently entertaining. After all, these people all have one thing in common – they’re in show business. And I suspect that any reader who decides to dip into this hefty history will find it impossible not to want to read more … and then more.</p> <p><em><strong>Hollywood: The Oral History</strong></em><strong> by </strong><strong>Jeanine Basinger and Sam Wasson is published by </strong><strong>Faber &amp; Faber, $49.99.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

Accurate, but criminally inadequate.</p> <p>“Sly”, to use the nickname bestowed on him by a cop after Sylvester Stallone, <i>is</i> a columnist for <i>The Age</i>. He’s also a reporter, commentator, author, broadcaster, podcaster, expert witness, speaker, raconteur and humourist. His weekly <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/naked-city-jbi\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Naked City </i>articles</a>, which you’ll find on <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/naked-city-jbi\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Naked City </i>articles</a> at lunchtime Friday and in the newspaper on Saturday, are among the most compelling pieces of journalism you will read each week and provide a window into a part of society that most of us studiously avoid, but are endlessly fascinated by. His weekly appearances on 3AW as Sly of the Underworld are usually entertaining, occasionally poignant and always informative.</p> <p>No one has a finer record of covering crime, corruption and policing in this state than Silvester, who began on the beat in Melbourne in 1979.</p> <p>In the past 44 years he has seen and written about disturbing tragedies that have left scars on Melbourne, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Street bombing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Street bombing</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Street bombing</a>. Long after most reporters have closed their files, Sly is still writing about those incidents, and the people whose lives they changed, as they continue to reverberate through Melbourne.</p> <p>He has had plenty of run-ins with crooks such as the terrifying “Badness”, who renamed him “Slime of the Underworld” and heckled him in various letters. He has received morbid Christmas cards from – and written books with – the late Mark “Chopper” Read.</p> <p>During 44 years of reporting on Melbourne’s underbelly, Silvester has not lost a milligram of sensitivity, wit or ability. All three of those traits are on display <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/deadly-mushrooms-mysteries-and-the-curious-cops-20230810-p5dvin.html\" target=\"_blank\">in this week’s column</a>, published earlier today, in which he looks at the latest on the Gippsland mushroom mystery, without losing sight of the fact three people beloved by their community have died in tragic circumstances.</p> <p>Even though he’s apparently just “a columnist,” Silvester’s reporting instincts kicked in this week, as they often do. In tandem with <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/by/marta-pascual-juanola-h1ep4c\" target=\"_blank\">Marta Pascual Juanola</a>, our reporter on the ground, he has been chasing leads on this tragedy while police attempt to piece together exactly what happened.</p> <p>A Graham Perkin Journalist of the Year alumnus, Silvester has won more journalism awards than you could poke a concealed weapon at. He has written numerous books, his <a href=\"https://podcasts.theage.com.au/podcasts/naked-city/\" target=\"_blank\">Naked City podcast</a> is a must-listen series and plans for a new weekly Naked City newsletter are in the works. He has provided evidence at royal commissions and has more cops and robbers in his contact book than a prison warden.<b> </b></p> <p>But I have a few contacts of my own.

He joined on August 24, 1993.</p> <p>Three decades of such excellent reporting for <em>The Age</em> requires acknowledgement and thanks, which I readily offer. It should also prompt a moment of reflection as to the importance of this kind of public interest journalism.</p> <p><i>The Age</i> has a long history of impeccable reporting on crime and justice, of which you as our backers and supporters should be proud.

       "   'headline': 'The darkly comic enigma who gave Chandler Bing his perfect smile',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>As Chandler Bing on the iconic television sitcom <em>Friends</em>, the late Matthew Perry possessed a unique combination of charm and vulnerability. He was quick-witted – aside from co-star Lisa Kudrow, he was easily the razor-sharpest of the show’s six stars – but in his delivery he had a brittle quality. Chandler Bing, like Matthew Perry, wore his sensitivity on his sleeve.</p> <p>There was an enigmatic ridiculousness to Chandler’s persona. He worked in the indecipherable field of statistical analysis and data reconfiguration. His father Charles transitioned into the cabaret star Helena Handbasket. His parents divorced over Thanksgiving dinner, leaving him haunted by the holiday season. He met every moment with wide-eyed, darkly comical horror.</p> <p>But what gave Chandler Bing real life was Perry’s extraordinary presence. And a smile that beamed from cheek to cheek, which came with an added twinkle in his eyes. When Perry looked at you, he really saw you. His gaze was intense but almost unguarded. Unlike many stars, who meet the spotlight head on, Perry, like Chandler, was always a little ill at ease.</p> <p>It is a truism in comedy – television sitcom, in particular – that the line between actor and character is often blurred. It is not a great mystery, it is a byproduct of the brutality of high-turnover cultural commerce. There is little time for nuance in the business of weekly TV, so in many ways the writers’ room depends on the show casting actors who, more or less, are the characters they are going to play.</p> <p>Which is not to say that Perry and Chandler Bing were one and the same. Rather, in Chandler’s most vulnerable moments, and in the moments when television comedy strays into dark emotion, Perry’s own sensitivities were never far from the surface. The pace of the show depended on that. And Perry, with a greater dramatic range than a sitcom ever really tapped, always hit his mark.</p> <p>I met Perry several times: on the set of <em>Friends</em> in the mid-1990s, at the height of its popularity, and years later, when he was promoting the reboot of <em>The Odd Couple</em> in 2015. In some respects, the two Matthew Perrys were wholly different. On the set of <em>Friends</em>, he was playful and charming, barely an adult. Being interviewed for <em>The Odd Couple</em> two decades later, he was guarded, bruised by the bumpy road of fame that had followed.</p> <p>At the same time, the two men were not so different. Both were candid. And even as an older man, Perry did not seem to lose the qualities of his younger self, the smile, the twinkle in the eye; uncertain about what the spotlight expected of him, but willing to have an honest conversation. And he was no less funny at 45 than he was at 25.</p> <p>Even in the last few years of his life – when his addiction and health issues were more widely known, and tackled with great candour in his autobiography <em>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir</em> – his humour was always on display. An unwillingness to take himself too seriously, and an unwillingness to take the burden of fame too seriously, either.</p> <p>On the cultural landscape, there sit few great generational comedies. <em>I Love Lucy</em> is one. For the generation that came after that, <em>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</em> is another. For an audience of a certain age, <em>Friends</em> is a third. A culturally definitive comedy that gave every group of schoolmates, roommates or work colleagues who watched familiar roles to play, and punchlines and moments to hang onto.</p> <p>In that sense, Chandler Bing was everyone’s roommate or co-worker, a big brother to some, and an imaginary boyfriend to others. It is a reflection of both the power of popular culture in a media-saturated world, and also the uniquely intimate properties of television, which brings fictional universes into our homes and hearts every day.</p> <p>For that reason, Perry’s death cuts deep. It momentarily silences the laughter. And it momentarily takes us into feelings of grief and loss. It seems almost absurd to feel so deeply the loss of a fictional character as much as the man who played him. But that is the oddness of television too; it creates inexplicable connections between the real and the imaginary.</p> <p>The world of <em>Friends</em> endures as a byproduct of another one of television’s quirks: the rerun. A total of 236 half-hour episodes, across 10 seasons. Wherever you go, whenever you switch on a TV, a local channel will be playing an episode. Streaming platforms will offer it on demand. The more fastidious will keep the DVDs on their shelves.</p> <p>What we find there is an extraordinary tapestry of great characters, beautifully written moments and nuances of performance that have turned Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, Monica, Joey and Rachel into mononyms. Like Oprah and Madonna, they are people – admittedly made-up ones – who endure in our conversations with a singular name.</p> <p>And within the rectangular frame of the television screen, Matthew Perry will endure, gifted a strange kind of immortality. Rendered in pixels, and replaying much-loved moments from our shared cultural memory, we may have lost the flesh-and-blood man, but his absurd and delightful alter ego, the uncertain duplicate that is Chandler Bing, will live forever.</p> <p><em><strong>Get the day’s breaking news, entertainment ideas and a long read to enjoy.

       "   'description': '<p>When it comes to the Academy Awards, it’s important to be honest. Brutally so. We understand that now thanks to brutally honest ballots like <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/brutally-honest-oscars-ballot-4-1235117325/\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>, wherein an Academy member reveals who and what they voted for while absolutely slamming the other nominees. We get a treasured glimpse into Oscars voting considerations along with an acute awareness that, as with most people, the Academy members have terrible taste in movies.</p> <p>I’ve been reading these mostly incomprehensible opinions for years and decided that I wanted in on the action. Of course, I am not technically a member of the Academy, so my “ballot”, such as it is, is not legal. As with the American presidential election, my vote doesn’t count.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I am voting – and I absolutely refuse to hold back. It’s important to be brutally honest. It’s <i>courageous</i>. I don’t have time to worry about the online regressive progressive left-right up-down mob swinging their cancel culture pitchforks and their sensitivity training torches.</p> <p>Because movies matter.</p> <h3>Best Picture</h3> <p>How’s this for honesty: 10 Best Picture nominees is too many movies. Make us choose between two. That’s it.</p> <p>Otherwise, I really enjoyed <i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i>. Very entertaining. I took <i>Avatar: The Way of Water</i> as a personal attack, as if James Cameron was trying to make fun of me somehow.</p> <p><i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> was, paradoxically, one of the noisiest movies I’ve ever seen. At 158 minutes, <i>Tar</i> was far too short. I needed another two or three hours to really get a feel for the character.</p> <p>While I’m being so brutally honest, I should mention that on several occasions, I have told people that I had COVID-19 so I wouldn’t have to hang out with them.</p> <p>VOTE: <i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i></p> <h3>Best Director</h3> <p>A lot of people don’t know this, but the “director” of a movie is usually the least useful person on a set. They literally just bumble around, forgetting people’s names and breaking expensive equipment. Especially if the director is Steven Spielberg. Or so I hear.</p> <p>Also, I promised my wife I was going to learn CPR but I haven’t done it. I’ve got the instructional DVD, but I just haven’t gotten around to watching it. The box has been sitting on a shelf for 11 years. Thankfully, in that time, no one near me has required resuscitation, or we’d all have been in big trouble.</p> <p>VOTE: Ruben Ostlund (<i>Triangle of Sadness</i>)</p> <h3>Best Actor</h3> <p>I don’t officially recognise movies with fat suits in them. So, thanks to <i>Elvis</i> and <i>The Whale</i>, this whole category is disqualified.</p> <p>In university, I once sang along to <em>Total Eclipse of the Heart</em> so loudly in my dorm room that people became worried about me. Reports were filed. It was a particularly emotional time and I found a lot of comfort in Bonnie Tyler’s soaring vocals…</p> <p><i>“Turn around…”</i></p> <p>VOTE: Paul Mescal (<i>Aftersun</i>)</p> <h3>Best Actress</h3> <p>Andrea Riseborough controversially enlisted the help of famous friends to lobby for her nomination in the supposedly underwhelming <i>To Leslie</i>. But the real dirty secret is that <i>To Leslie</i> is the best movie of the last 50 years.</p> <p>Also, I have eaten an entire log of pre-made chocolate chip cookie dough in one sitting.</p> <p>And when I say “sitting”, I don’t mean “sitting”, because I was standing. In front of the fridge. And when I say “standing”, I mean “hunched”. And when I say “in front of”, I mean “inside”.</p> <p>VOTE: Michelle Yeoh (<i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i>)</p> <h3>Best Supporting Actor</h3> <p>I have been a tremendous Judd Hirsch (<i>The Fabelmans</i>) stan since he played Saul in <i>Fear on Trial</i> in 1975. He is a master and Brendan Gleeson (<i>The Banshees of Inisherin</i>) has been ripping off his acting style for decades.</p> <p>I’ve been telling people that I meditate but I don’t.</p> <p>During lockdown, I tried to develop the practice, but it didn’t take. And yet I maintained the facade. Why? I guess I want (need?) the respect and admiration of strangers. And I guess I don’t want to admit that deep down, I’m probably a little bit of a quitter.</p> <p>Wow. That one stung. This is not easy.</p> <p>VOTE: Ke Huy Quan (<i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i>)</p> <h3>Best Supporting Actress</h3> <p>Brutally Honest Confession #1: Kerry Condon (<i>The Banshees of Inisherin</i>) hasn’t made a good movie since <i>How Harry Became a Tree</i> in 2001.</p> <p>Brutally Honest Confession #2: I am not 100 per cent sure who Kerry Condon is.</p> <p>Brutally Honest Confession #3: During a regrettable two-week stay at a summer camp when I was 12, I ran into someone who’d bullied me in school. When he said I looked familiar, I pretended not to understand or speak English. I was just a boy and I was afraid.</p> <p>There’s more:</p> <p>Whenever my wife asks me how far away I am, I always say “15 minutes”.</p> <p>Whether I’m half an hour away or two hours, my answer is always the same. I can be in my pyjamas, still in bed, trapped under something heavy and I will always say that I’m just 15 minutes away. I’m in the car. (I’m not.) I’m coming around the corner, I can see you. (I can’t.) I’m parked right in front of you, don’t you see me? (I’m not, she can’t.) It’s obviously not a great system but I don’t know how to stop.</p> <p>I frequently pretend to be friends with Martin Scorsese.</p> <p>I say that he’s a family friend from New York and I grew up going to his house and that I gave him the idea for <i>Goodfellas</i>. I say that I used to call him Uncle Marty and he called me Nicky Little Shoes and that he bought me my first fedora and we still go to Disney World every year.</p> <p>I’m sorry, just a few bullet points I wanted to make sure I covered…</p> <ul><li>I keep a World War II Documentary Diary.

       "   'description': '<p>For television historians amateur and professional, the easiest place to begin the story of the contemporary Golden Age of Television is on January 10, 1999, when Tony Soprano first paid a toll on the New Jersey Turnpike. But perhaps we might be better served to rewind the clock approximately six years, to January 31, 1993, the premiere of a new NBC drama, set in Baltimore, studying the work of the city’s homicide detectives.</p> <p>The series was called <em>Homicide: Life on the Street</em>, and it was based on a book by David Simon, then a Baltimore <em>Sun</em> reporter who had spent a year tagging along with the police department’s homicide squad. <em>Homicide</em> was never a ratings success, but it stayed on the air for seven seasons, winning four Emmys and three Peabody Awards. The show was prickly, funny, morally forceful, endlessly discursive and filled with a murderers’ row of actors, including future stars Andre Braugher (who won an Emmy for his performance as Frank Pembleton), Melissa Leo and Giancarlo Esposito, along with veterans like Ned Beatty, Yaphet Kotto and Richard Belzer, known primarily then as a stand-up comedian.</p> <p>The show’s sixth episode, <em>Three Men and Adena</em>, which first aired in March, was a stark, dramatic example of what made <em>Homicide</em> different from other cop shows. It takes place almost entirely within the confines of an interrogation room, with detectives Pembleton and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) attempting to wring a confession out of Risley Tucker (Moses Gunn), an itinerant fruit-and-vegetable man, after the murder of a little girl named Adena Watson. Pembleton and Bayliss prod, provoke and rage, but <em>Homicide</em> refuses to grant the audience the resolution they crave. Tucker doesn’t crack. Adena’s case is never solved. (The showrunner, Tom Fontana, won an Emmy for writing the episode.)</p> <p>Thirty years later, Fontana, executive producers Barry Levinson and Paul Attanasio and actors Braugher and Secor reflected on <em>Three Men and Adena</em>, in particular, and on the broader legacy of the series and their frustration at its still not being available to stream. These are edited excerpts from conversations with them.</p> <p>After Levinson, a Baltimore native known for setting films like <em>Diner</em> and <em>Avalon</em> in the city, read Simon’s book, he knew he wanted to adapt it. But he thought TV would be a better venue. He hired Attanasio to create the series and write the pilot, and he eventually brought in Fontana to run the show.</p> <p>TOM FONTANA: I said, “I’m not really sure I want to do a cop show.” And Levinson said: “This is about the homicide detectives. They’re thinking cops. There’s no gunbattles, there’s no car chases.” And I said: “That’s impossible. I’ll do it.”</p> <p>BARRY LEVINSON: I thought it ought to be done completely in Baltimore. We can do it really down and dirty and lean. Instead of shooting 35-millimeter film, we’ll shoot in Super 16 and with hand-held cameras.</p> <p>FONTANA: I think I’ve read David’s book more times than I’ve read any other book in my life. By the time we were done, we’d used everything in the book, including the commas and question marks.</p> <p>PAUL ATTANASIO: I built Frank Pembleton out of the idea of a character who didn’t want a partner. And then Kyle’s character, Bayliss, was a more functional, more conventional television character who was the rookie, so you could use him as a guide to bring you into the show.</p> <p>FONTANA: Our premiere was after the Super Bowl. NBC was very jazzed about that. I said to Barry: “After the Super Bowl, everybody’s drunk! This isn’t a show you can watch drunk.”</p> <p>ANDRE BRAUGHER: The first year, there was a sort of Jean-Luc Godard jump-cut sensibility that we enjoyed.</p> <p>FONTANA: I said to Barry, “You know, I’d love to write an episode that basically only takes place in the interrogation room.” And he said: “Let’s just try it. Let’s try everything.”</p> <p>KYLE SECOR: I went in and met them. Within a couple minutes, they said, “The sixth episode we’re going to do, it’s just going to be three guys in an interrogation room. It’ll be you, your partner and this other character.” And I went, “Oh, well, I’m in.”</p> <p>FONTANA: The real girl who was murdered in Baltimore, that the Adena Watson story was based on, her murder was never solved. I made a decision that we would never solve the murder on the show because we felt like it would be disrespectful to the family and to the young girl’s memory.</p> <p>SECOR: We had rehearsals before shooting, which was a comfort. Andre and I had spent a lot of time in that room, and it felt like that was our room. We had control of that room.</p> <p>BRAUGHER: We performed it like a theatre piece. There’s nowhere to go. It’s a strangely shaped little room with a door and a window. So it’s just three men going around and around and around again.</p> <p>FONTANA: We are asking the audience to watch this hour of intense interrogation and then not give them the solution they were hoping for. That was satisfying for me as well, because I didn’t want it to be all neat and tidy at the end.</p> <p>ATTANASIO: I think what’s really brilliant about that script is, it’s one thing to say you’re not to give the audience what they’re looking for. But then the question is, what are you going to give them? And what Tom gave them was heartbreak. And irresolution.</p> <p>FONTANA: I knew the rhythms of Andre and Secor. And I knew that it had to have twists and turns, and that eventually, Tucker would start indicting them. I knew going in that was the way it would travel.</p> <p>ATTANASIO: It’s not just good like bran cereal is good for you. It’s electrifying. You can’t take your eyes off it. And all it is, is three actors in a room.</p> <p>BRAUGHER: It’s the most fun I’ve had filming an episode. It was physically hard, it was emotionally taxing, but it was very satisfying.</p> <p>At the end of the episode, Bayliss takes the photograph of Adena from the interrogation room and places it on his desk, where it remains for multiple seasons.</p> <p>SECOR: When I met Tom Pellegrini, who was the detective that I was based on, I got Bayliss immediately as someone where being unable to solve this case affected his entire life. Affected his marriage, affected relationships, affected his job, affected how he saw his work, everything.</p> <p>FONTANA: If you’re going to track a character over the life of a series, you need to see the stuff that he or she accumulates. There was an episode where he puts the picture in a drawer. He was sort of like, “I have to get past this now.”</p> <p>BRAUGHER: That’s one of the beautiful things about the episode. It doesn’t resolve in favour of our heroes. The moral frustration in the entire series is that Adena Watson’s murder is never solved.</p> <p>FONTANA: My career has been an endless number of shows that I’m proud of that never were in the Top 10, starting with <em>St. Elsewhere</em>.</p> <p>ATTANASIO: Don Ohlmeyer (then NBC’s West Coast president) loved the show, as long as they could make it for a reasonable amount of money.</p> <p>BRAUGHER: When I think back to that initial group, that first- and second-year group, it was a wonderful cast and boy, were we quirky. Boy, were we misfits, and I loved it.</p> <p>LEVINSON: For the last four years, I’ve tried to get an answer for why we’re not on streaming. No one, I mean no one, has been able to give me an answer. There’s money to be made. You can’t figure out how to handle whatever rights issues that may come up? You’re talking over 120-some[thing] episodes. And somehow no one can figure out how to handle the rights? That doesn’t make sense!</p> <p>SECOR: Who knows? Maybe we’ll start streaming on Netflix!</p> <p>This article originally appeared in The New York Times.</p> <p><strong>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/arts/television/homicide-life-on-the-street.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</strong></p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'description': '<p><b>Silo ★★★★<br/></b>Apple TV+, Friday</p> <p>A worthy mystery needs a suitable detective to unravel it and one the many impressive elements of this science-fiction puzzle is that has a succession of them. Set in a self-contained underground city, hundreds of floors deep but shallow in answers, <i>Silo</i> creates a thread of inquisitors: some official and some unlikely, some obsessed and some scared to ask. The way the story passes along their enquiry, with intimacy and genuine understanding, helps make this series resonate in valuable and unforeseen ways.</p> <p>The titular structure is a society of approximately 10,000 people, organised for mutual survival in the face of a post-apocalyptic landscape above their heads; the city’s death sentence is to be sent outside. It’s a strange new world and those who want answers to the existential questions have to overcome the communal belief in sticking together, whether it’s IT clerk Allison (Rashida Jones), her sheriff husband Holston (David Oyelowo), and finally, a generator engineer, Juliette (Rebecca Ferguson). Each illuminates the mystery differently.</p> <p>The drama was adapted from the Steve Howey’s series of novels by Graham Yost (<i>Justified</i>), who with lead director Morten Tyldum (<i>The Imitation Game</i>) creates an engrossing world that naturally reveals the lives and limits of the population. Staircases link the Silo – no elevators – and porters run up and down constantly in the background, another noteworthy detail alongside the darned clothes, worn infrastructure, and worrying tilt towards authoritarianism in the name of safety. You pick up traditions, baffling rules, and slang.</p> <p>With her hum of unease and a seditious tilt of her head, <i>Mission: Impossible</i> and <i>Dune</i> star Ferguson is a compelling, unpredictable investigator – a loner who can fix broken objects but not herself. Because she’s from the working-class bottom of the city, the “down deep”, her ventures into the “up top” mark her as an outsider. The big questions – who built the silo? Why is there no record of what happened outside? – percolate throughout, but the writing doesn’t grind them out.</p> <p>One episode is mostly dedicated to a crucial maintenance mission, told with ticking clock tension. It’s indicative of the astute storytelling that underpins this vertical <i>Snowpiercer</i>. Life for the most part goes on in the city even as the search for answers becomes ever more intense – this is a long tail narrative, confident enough to give audiences a little insight early on and then let navigate the sharp turns. It’s an elegant, immersive puzzle, but also an exploration of the mutual obligations that hold every society together.</p> <p><b>Bupkis ★★★½ <br/></b>Binge</p> <p>29-years-old sounds young to be making an autobiographical series, but it turns out that Pete Davidson – the <i>Saturday Night Live</i> comic and former boyfriend of Ariana Grande and Kim Kardashian – has plenty to say about himself. In fact, perhaps too much. These 25-minute slices of life about a barely fictionalised Pete Davidson are equal parts celebrity explainer and therapy session, absurdist comedy and earnest dedication.</p> <p>Co-created by Davidson, <i>Bupkis</i> mirrors his life, from living in his mother’s basement to losing firefighter father on 9/11, although his screen mother is played by Edie Falco with Joe Pesci as his ailing grandfather. Davidson is self-deprecating but vulnerable. He’s trying to figure himself out on screen. The second episode, a childhood flashback to his aunt’s wedding with Bobby Cannavale as the groom, is bittersweet but somewhat baffling.</p> <p>There are trace elements of <i>Atlanta</i> here, alongside celebrity cameos including an Al Gore and Jon Stewart two-hander, and in a way Davidson is auditioning the audience: are you willing to encompass all the sides of me that I struggle with? There’s a certain arrogance in that, but even with the considerable advice dispensed and latent self-obsession, Pete Davidson and <i>Bupkis</i> grow on you.</p> <p><b>Citadel<br/></b>Amazon Prime</p> <p>It may have a Jason Bourne joke, but as reportedly one of the most expensive television shows ever made this spy action-thriller wants to be Bond, Bourne, and beyond. The flaky globe-trotting narrative has Priyanka Chopra Jonas (<i>Quantico</i>) and Richard Madden (<i>Bodyguard</i>) as elite private agents fighting a nefarious organisation to stay alive. The show – in just six episodes – is trying to include everything: massive set-pieces, steamy romance, breathless fun, and save the world angst. The plotting is fantastical, and the leads solid, but the series struggles to rise above the piecemeal.</p> <p><b>Secrets of the Elephants<br/></b>Disney+</p> <p>Narrated by Natalie Portman with pachyderm expert Dr Paula Kahumbu as the audience’s guide, this four-part National Geographic documentary series is a detailed journey into the family life, difficult conditions, and demanding treks that form the life of desert elephants in the African country of Namibia. The production values and breadth of footage is first-rate, with the show taking the time to establish the hardy rhythms and necessary demands of the creature’s lives. It’s welcome family viewing, but thankfully it’s mostly without treacly sentiment or goofy interludes.</p> <p><b>Queenmaker<br/></b>Netflix</p> <p>A super-charged <i>Scandal</i> set in South Korea, this close to unhinged political drama follows the unlikely alliance between a lawyer who advocates for the vulnerable, Oh Kyung-sook (Moon So-ri) and the Machiavellian fixer for ruthless family conglomerate, Hwang Do-hee (Kim Hee-ae). When the latter has a crisis of conscience, she recruits the former to run as Seoul’s mayor against the nepo baby son of her former boss. The storytelling is expansive and the pacing variable, but the tricks of the fixer trade are highly watchable and the eventual friendship between the two women is genuinely forged.</p> <p><b>Blindspotting (season 2)<br/></b>Stan</p> <p>The first season of this American comedy-drama about the idiosyncratic bonds and unexpected of a modern blended family – Ashley (Jasmin Cephas-Jones) and her young son have to move in with mother-in-law, Rainey (Helen Hunt), after her partner, Miles (Rafael Casals), is incarcerated – went under the radar. Set in Oakland, it’s a timely show about race, class, and family, with the new season continuing to mix raucous humour with hard-won insight. The characters are trying to grow, to do better, but progress is easily derailed. The show never preaches.</p> <p><b><i>Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees. </i></b><b><i><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=the-watchlist\" target=\"_blank\">Get The Watchlist</a></i></b><b><i> delivered every Thursday.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Why Stephen Sondheim is one of the all-time great writers',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>It’s official: Stephen Sondheim is the all-time greatest writer of musicals. OK, this is from a straw poll of only two people, but the pair in question, performer and director Nancye Hayes and director Stuart Maunder, are musical theatre royalty.</p> <p>Suggest that Sondheim was the only creator of musicals to hold a candle to such playwrights as Tennessee Williams in terms of complex characterisations and there’s more furious agreement. As there is for the idea that, with his rhymes a match for Byron or Pope, his work was not just at the pinnacle of theatre, but of writing, period.</p> <p>And then there’s his music.</p> <p>This year seems to be Sydney’s unofficial Stephen Sondheim year, with three of his shows being staged: <em>Into the Woods</em> at Belvoir in March, the Maunder-directed <em>Sweeney Todd</em> about to open at the Opera House and <em>A Little Night Music</em>, starring Hayes, arriving in October at the theatre bearing her name 50 years after it premiered on Broadway.</p> <p>Maunder, among our most acclaimed directors of both musicals and opera, describes <em>Sweeney Todd – </em>the gothic tale of a barber with a taste for unusually close shaves, and of Mrs Lovett, a pie-maker with a taste for baking his victims – as a “bizarre hybrid”.</p> <p>“It has conquered the operatic stages of the world as well as the theatre stages,” he says. “Sondheim famously called the piece a thriller because it’s an opera if it’s in an opera house, and it’s a play if it’s in a playhouse. So in a way, he’s created his own genre.”</p> <p>This may not have been so obvious when Maunder once directed a children’s production of the show (which seems rather close to having kids do <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>), but now with Antoinette Halloran as Mrs Lovett and Ben Mingay as Todd, he finds a complexity in the relationship between the leads that he thinks many productions have obscured.</p> <p>“There’s a real – if strange – love story there that needs to be teased out,” he says.</p> <p>For Maunder, the only musical by Sondheim – “the 20th century’s great songwriter” – to rival <em>Sweeney</em> is <em>A Little Night Music</em>, which he’s directed four times (including twice with Hayes playing Madame Armfeldt).</p> <p>He especially admires how directors can approach the show from different angles.</p> <p>“It’s an incredibly truthful, beautiful piece of work,” he says. “It’s just so honest when these two people, Desiree and Fredrik, come together at the end, and they sit on a bed, and she sings <em>Send in the Clowns </em>… It’s that problem that we all face of finding different people at different times in our lives, and making choices that end up being disastrous for us.”</p> <p>He also enthuses about <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>, Sondheim’s explosively imaginative piece about the creative process, and <em>Into the Woods</em>, which he calls “the hardest show in the world to direct” because it has so many principals.</p> <p>“They’re masterful in their conception, and you alter these pieces at your peril because they are so beautifully honed,” he says.</p> <p>Hayes’ performances have been honed across countless productions – she’s starred in more Australian premieres of major musicals than she can count. Maunder first worked with her in 2008 when she played what he calls “the most acerbic, charming, funny Mrs Higgins” in his Opera Australia production of <em>My Fair Lady</em>.</p> <p>Since then, they’ve collaborated on <em>Night Music</em> and <em>Sunday in the Park</em>, and he has boundless admiration for her “ability to go straight to the truth of a moment”.</p> <p>Hayes says choosing a favourite Sondheim show is as hard as “naming your favourite child”, but that playing Mrs Lovett in <em>Sweeney </em>is a strong contender.</p> <p>She first encountered Sondheim in the flesh when he came here with director Hal Prince and lyricist Alan Jay Lerner in 1977 for a theatre forum at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.</p> <p>“He said he was working on a musical based on a play he’d seen in London about the demon barber of Fleet Street,” she recounts. “He was actually starting work on that!”</p> <p>Then she saw the original Broadway <em>Sweeney</em> (with Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou). “And it just blew me away,” she says. “It was late 1979, and I couldn’t wait to get back to the hotel and ring someone to tell them how extraordinary it was, but it was the middle of the night in Australia, and it was very frustrating!”</p> <p>In October Hayes plays Madame Armfeldt again, this time with Dean Bryant directing, and she’s looking forward to the new take he’ll have on <em>Night Music</em>, given the theatre’s constraints.</p> <p>As Madame Armfeldt she sings the fabulous <em>Liaisons</em>, crammed with the wry observations of a woman who’s seen it all, including that we mere mortals muddle sex with desire. Hayes especially loves the lines: “Take my daughter, I taught her, I tried my best to point the way. I even named her Desiree.”</p> <p>She says performing Sondheim’s work is not easy, “but it’s enormously rewarding if you get it right – for both yourself and an audience”.</p> <p>For Hayes, getting it right these days also includes overcoming nerves. “I think the more you do, the worse it gets,” she observes. “There’s so much more you expect of yourself because you feel it’s expected of <em>you</em>. When you’re young, and you’re just loving every second of it, it carries you through.”</p> <p>Then there’s the added pressure of playing in a theatre named after her. “Yes, it is a bit daunting,” she admits.</p> <p>But ultimately, she still relishes being part of a company, and each performance being a fresh chance to give her best.</p> <p>When she became friends with Hal Prince, they’d dine together when she was in New York, sometimes joined by Sondheim. “A shy man,” she recalls. “He probably preferred to be back working on something.”</p> <p><strong><em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street </em>is at the Opera House Drama Theatre from July 22 to August 27. <em>A Little Night Music</em> is at Hayes Theatre from October 13 to November 11.</strong></p> <p><b><i>The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger. </i></b><b><i>Get it delivered every Friday</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>',\n",

       "   'headline': 'Lost its mojo? No way. Ted Lasso is still the sweetest show on TV',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>There’s been a lot of talk about <em>Ted Lasso</em>. Speculation that the just-concluded third season will be its last. Narrow assessments and lofty dismissals propose that, whatever its future, the soccer-club comedy had lost its mojo anyway; so no great loss. Regretful pronouncements judge that the long-awaited 2023 season didn’t exhibit the disarming magic that had made the series a global hit and an awards-show darling. Its sunny spirit, kind heart and sweet optimism arrived like the ideal tonic for dark and scary pandemic times.</p> <p>The London-based comedy sees co-creator, co-writer and co-producer Jason Sudeikis playing the title character, a preternaturally compassionate fish-out-of-water coach from America’s Midwest struggling with a foreign sporting code and a marriage breakdown when he’s employed to revive a struggling English soccer team.</p> <p>At the time of writing, Apple TV+ hadn’t confirmed or denied the end of Ted and its coyness is perhaps understandable. There might be uncertainty from the creative team about if and how to proceed. There could be reluctance from a multinational corporation to bid a final farewell to one of its standout successes, even though the series was originally conceived with a three-season arc.</p> <p>Of course, things can change. Supply can respond to demand. Acclaim, awards and viewer enthusiasm might motivate a desire to carry on and not kill the golden goose. Or a rethink could result in some shapeshifting: Ted goes on, but not as we know it. Describing the audience wanting more as “flattering”, Sudeikis recently remarked to <em>Deadline</em>, perhaps as a throwaway, that he could appear on Cameo, the website where fans can request personalised videos from their favourite actors.</p> <p>Then there’s the spin-off route, where one of the characters is plucked from the pack and becomes the star of his or her own sequel. Certainly, there are enough candidates in this vibrant ensemble to inspire ideas about the possibilities: think of, say, Keeping Up With Keeley, Uncle Roy, or At Home With Higgins. However, the attempt to again catch lightning in a bottle is a demonstrably risky road: for every fabulous <em>Frasier</em>, there are a dozen unfortunate <em>Joey</em>s.</p> <p>While the future is uncertain, the question of quality is easier to address as <em>Ted Lasso</em> clearly became a victim of its own success. Initially ecstatically embraced, it was showered with love, praise and prizes. In a way, the only direction it could go from such heights was down to disappointment. But by way of response to the criticism that it’s not what it once was, that the third season has been bloated and static and that the show has lost its spark: oh, phooey.</p> <p>True, it no longer has the advantage of being a novelty. Now, to some extent, we know what to expect, and the third season has been rich in familiar pleasures. Sweet-natured without being syrupy, it’s reinforced the production’s basic tenets, to do with the value of family and community, and the importance of tolerance, second chances and forgiveness.</p> <p>But, in spite of viewers’ knowing the comedy’s DNA, it’s retained a capacity to surprise and delight. That’s neatly illustrated by the Amsterdam episode featuring an unplanned yet blissful night on a houseboat for Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham), bicycle adventures for Roy (Brett Goldstein) and Jamie (Phil Dunster), a jazz-club visit for Leslie (Jeremy Swift) and Will (Charlie Hiscock), and some unexpected bonding for Colin (Billy Harris) and Trent (James Lance). All that as well as nifty references to <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> and <em>Almost Famous</em>. Beautiful.</p> <p>Through the seasons, with a light touch and thoughtful intelligence, the series has also tackled some tough stuff, examining anxiety, the aftermath of divorce and the damaging impact for men of concealing or repressing their emotions. This season also addresses issues of privacy and online hacking; coming out as gay; the toxicity of social media; and racism.</p> <p>One of the criticisms recently levelled at the show is that the title character is less interesting than those surrounding him. Even if that is the case – and it’s debatable – who cares? In some ways, that’s a sign of a great ensemble. As if testifying to the strength of its cast, at the 2021 Emmy Awards, four of the nominees in the Outstanding Supporting Actor category came from the show (Goldstein won). In 2022, <em>Ted Lasso</em> had three nominations in the Outstanding Actor and Outstanding Supporting Actress categories.</p> <p>Through the latest season, Keeley (Juno Temple) has again shone as a beacon of effervescence; Roy has continued to elevate grunting, scowling and swearing to the level of magnificence; Dani (Cristo Fernandez) and Sam (Toheeb Jimoh) have remained a joy. With Barbara (Katy Wix), the rain cloud of a CFO at Keeley’s PR firm, an Eeyore of a character became an understated treasure.</p> <p>And the trajectory chosen for kit-man-turned “Wonder Kid” Nathan (Nick Mohammed), who betrayed Ted, rewarding his mentor’s support with treachery, has been true to the series’ principles and logic. Instead of punishing or humiliating him, relishing in his comeuppance, Nate gets what he thought he wanted, discovers how hollow his ambitions were, and tries to make amends for his bad behaviour.</p> <p>Whatever happens from here, <em>Ted Lasso</em> has for three sparkling seasons championed kindness and compassion without getting mushy. It’s made us laugh and cry with clever comedy that’s blessed with wit and a gift for goofiness. It’s given us vibrant characters to care about and hope to see more of.

       "   'headline': 'The famous friends who saved Wilco singer after a 15-metre fall',\n",
       "   'description': '<p>Jeff Tweedy was bruised and shaken after taking a 15-metre fall down the side of a cliff. When he looked up, comedian Nick Offerman and author George Saunders were looking down at him with concern on their faces.</p> <p>No, this wasn’t a dream. This actually happened four years ago on a five-day hike in Glacier National Park in Montana, when the Wilco frontman slipped on melting ice.</p> <p>Yes, Tweedy is “pals”, as he puts it, with the star of <em>Parks And Recreation</em> and the Booker Prize-winning writer.</p> <p>“I met Nick when I appeared on <em>Parks And Rec</em>,” says Tweedy, reclining on a couch in his basement in Chicago after a day of rehearsals with Wilco for their upcoming world tour, a cat-shaped pillow behind his head and a collection of his late father’s electronic gadgets lining the shelves.</p> <p>“Apparently the conversation in the writers’ room went something like, ‘We need to find an ageing, washed-up rock star.’ And someone else said, ‘someone like Jeff Tweedy?’ And someone else said, ′Well, why don’t we just ask Jeff Tweedy?’”</p> <p>Offerman interviewed Tweedy and Saunders separately for his book <em>Gumption</em>, about 21 Americans who had shaped his world. Tweedy met Saunders when the two appeared on the final episode of <em>The Colbert Report</em>, along with a rollcall of over 100 guests that included Cookie Monster, Willie Nelson, Cyndi Lauper, George Lucas and Henry Kissinger.</p> <p>“George is one of my favourite authors, so I went searching for him backstage,” recalls Tweedy. “I saw him come out of the door of one of the dressing rooms and I said, ‘You’re the person I’m most excited to meet here.’ And he said, ‘Well, I was just coming to find you.’ It was very romantic.”</p> <p>Saunders told Tweedy he had listened to the sprawling Wilco song <em>One Sunday Morning (Song For Jane Smiley’s Boyfriend)</em> over and over every day while writing some of the stories in his collection <em>Tenth Of December</em>.</p> <p>He went on to write a piece about the song for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> in 2016, calling it “a reliable 12-minute prayer” and calling Tweedy “one of the great conversational poets of our time.”</p> <p>It wasn’t long before “a three-way bromance” (Offerman’s words in an interview with Stephen Colbert) was instigated, starting with long text threads between the trio, and culminating in the hike, which made its way into Offerman’s latest book, <em>Where The Deer And The Antelope Play</em>.</p> <p>Tweedy himself is also on a roll in the book-writing department. He has already published two – the 2018 memoir <em>Let’s Go (So We Can Get Back)</em> and 2020’s <em>How To Write One Song.</em><em></em></p> <p>The latter is a revealing and generous book about the creative process and why he thinks everyone should do it. He writes about pushing your ego out of the way and creating for the sake of creativity, and the feeling of disappearing when you’re truly in the moment.</p> <p>I point out that people also use drugs to disappear. Tweedy, 56, used to be addicted to prescription opiates he took for crippling migraines. How did things change for him creatively when he got sober 19 years ago?</p> <p>“It would be more accurate to say that I created those older songs in spite of being an addict,” he says. “Those issues I had were a distraction and sapped my energy, but the part of myself I was writing from was the part that was there before I did drugs. It was the part of me that was childlike and wanted a song to sing. That was the big revelation for me when I got sober. And that’s why I can still sing those songs and not feel like they were written by a different person.“</p> <p>Wilco are a self-sufficient band with their own studio, The Loft. But for the latest Wilco album, <em>Cousin</em>, they invited Welsh singer-songwriter Cate Le Bon to produce.</p> <p>“I met Cate when she played Solid Sound (the Massachusetts festival Tweedy curates) in 2019,” he says. “We performed an Arthur Russell song and Strangers by The Kinks together and hit it off right away. Then whenever Cate and her band came through Chicago on tour they would either stay at The Loft or use it for rehearsals. She just became part of the family.</p> <p>“And when I heard her version of the Wilco song <em>Company In My Back</em>, which she recorded at The Loft for a cover-mount CD for Mojo magazine, it blew me away because it was such an imaginative arrangement and a unique sound. So I thought I’d ask her to produce us.“</p> <p>A couple of the new songs are among the most politically pointed Tweedy has penned. Ten Dead came from a news story he saw on TV about yet another US school shooting.</p> <p>“The reporter literally said ‘only 10 dead’,” says Tweedy, slowly shaking his head. “He almost had this tone of disappointment that it wasn’t a bigger news story. Or maybe he was saying ‘Well, it’s good that it was only ten.’ Either way, it was an appalling thing to say.</p> <p>“And look, I know we hear people singing songs about things like this and go, ‘Oh yeah, the world was really waiting for you to weigh in on this. Thank you for appropriating someone else’s trauma.’ But I was trying to highlight the insanity of this becoming so matter-of-fact. The rational response to this is ‘No, this can’t happen anymore.’ It’s painfully obvious what we should do about it. Instead, we hear people talking about giving kids bulletproof backpacks.”</p> <p>The title track is close to home, aimed at relatives who expressed far-right views after Donald Trump came to power.</p> <p>“It’s really more about my dad than me. Before he died (in 2017) he saw family members turn their backs on democracy and decency. They felt emboldened to express their bigotry. It was something that deeply upset my father. He wasn’t a liberal by any means. He grew up in southern Illinois and he worked on the railroad. But he was decent and smart and thought Trump was what he called ‘a boss’s son’. And, in his mind, there was nothing worse than that.“</p> <p>Tweedy has a third book due out in November. <em>The World Within A Song</em> will be his deep dive into 50 songs by other artists. Despite the fact he had already written a memoir, he found this book ended up being even more autobiographical, “because songs become part of our own biography, they work their way into our memories and self-image.”</p> <p>Many of Tweedy’s choices will be unsurprising to those who follow his work: Mavis Staples, The Replacements, Dolly Parton, the Velvet Underground. But a couple may put the cat among Wilco’s “dad rock” contingent – and perhaps educate them.</p> <p>“I chose <em>I Love You</em> by Billie Eilish, because, like a lot of her songs, it has this majestic, sublime melody. I think she and her brother would have been successful songwriters and performers in any era. Her songs are like jazz or torch songs, but she’s extremely modern.</p> <p>“And I chose a song by Rosalia because I think she may be the greatest artist walking the earth right now. She has this incredible gift and she made this quantum leap from studying flamenco as a young girl to basically reinventing reggaeton music. It’s like she’s Miles Davis or Pablo Picasso. She had to be in the book.”</p> <p><strong><em>Cousin</em> is out now. Wilco play The Forum in Melbourne on March 16, 17 and 18; the Sydney Opera House on March 22 and the Enmore Theatre on November 22.</strong></p>',\n",

       "   'description': 'The image presents a split composition, juxtaposing a headshot of a woman on the left with the cover of a book on the right.\\n\\n**Left Side (Headshot):**\\n\\nThe woman in the headshot appears to be middle-aged, with shoulder-length dark brown hair parted slightly off-center. Her expression is neutral, almost pensive, with her lips closed in a relaxed position. Her gaze is direct, looking straight at the camera. Her skin tone is light, with a natural complexion. She wears a dark v-neck shirt underneath a light gray, textured blazer or cardigan. The background consists of horizontal, dark-colored slats, likely part of a wall or other architectural feature. The lighting is even and soft, suggesting a professional or semi-professional setting for the photograph.\\n\\n**Right Side (Book Cover):**\\n\\nThe book cover features a vintage aesthetic, reminiscent of 1960s or 1970s fashion photography. A woman with long, light brown hair is seated in the driver\\'s seat of a convertible car. She wears large, round, white earrings and a flowing, sleeveless, mustard-yellow top or dress. Her profile is visible as she looks away from the camera, towards the road ahead.  She holds the steering wheel with one hand and rests the other on the car\\'s gear shift. The car itself is a light color, possibly white or cream, and the background suggests a cityscape or urban setting. The book title, \"ROMANTIC COMEDY,\" is displayed vertically along the left edge of the cover in bold, uppercase letters. The author\\'s name, \"CURTIS SITTENFELD,\" appears in a larger, bolder font at the bottom of the cover, also in uppercase.  Two blurbs, seemingly positive reviews or endorsements, are placed on the cover. One, attributed to Kate Atkinson, reads, \"One of my favourite writers\\'.\" The other, from Elizabeth Day, states, \"I am obsessed with this book. Warm, wise, extremely funny.\"  A smaller line of text at the bottom identifies the book as a \"Sunday Times and New York Times bestseller.\"\\n\\n**Relationship between the two halves:**\\n\\nThe juxtaposition strongly suggests that the woman in the headshot is Curtis Sittenfeld, the author of the book \"Romantic Comedy\" displayed on the right. The image likely serves as promotional material, combining a portrait of the author with the visually appealing book cover.\\n\\n**Detailed Description and Analysis:**\\n\\n**Headshot (Left):**\\n\\n* **Framing and Composition:** The headshot is tightly cropped, focusing on the woman\\'s face and upper torso.  The horizontal lines of the background provide a contrasting visual element to the subject\\'s vertical posture.\\n* **Lighting and Color:** The lighting is soft and diffused, minimizing harsh shadows and creating a natural look. The color palette is muted, with the gray blazer and dark shirt complementing the subject\\'s hair and skin tone.\\n* **Expression and Pose:** The woman\\'s expression is neutral and approachable, conveying a sense of confidence and professionalism. Her direct gaze engages the viewer, while her relaxed posture suggests a sense of ease and comfort.\\n\\n**Book Cover (Right):**\\n\\n* **Visual Style and Era:** The cover\\'s vintage aesthetic, characterized by the car, the woman\\'s clothing and hairstyle, and the color palette, evokes a sense of nostalgia and classic Hollywood glamour. This style likely aims to attract readers interested in romantic stories with a retro feel.\\n* **Typography and Layout:** The vertical placement of the title \"ROMANTIC COMEDY\" is unconventional yet eye-catching. The bold, uppercase font emphasizes the genre and creates a strong visual impact. The author\\'s name, prominently displayed at the bottom, reinforces brand recognition.\\n* **Imagery and Symbolism:** The image of the woman driving a convertible suggests independence, freedom, and a sense of adventure. The yellow top or dress adds a touch of vibrancy and optimism, while the urban setting hints at a sophisticated and contemporary backdrop for the story.\\n* **Blurbs and Endorsements:** The inclusion of positive blurbs from established authors like Kate Atkinson and Elizabeth Day adds credibility and social proof, encouraging potential readers to pick up the book.  The use of phrases like \"favourite writers\\',\" \"obsessed,\" \"warm,\" \"wise,\" and \"funny\" provides concise yet compelling insights into the book\\'s tone and content.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe combined image effectively promotes Curtis Sittenfeld\\'s book \"Romantic Comedy.\" The professional headshot presents the author in a relatable and approachable manner, while the eye-catching book cover conveys the genre and tone of the story. The vintage aesthetic and positive endorsements further enhance the book\\'s appeal, targeting readers seeking a lighthearted, romantic escape with a touch of classic Hollywood charm. The image is well-suited for use in online advertising, social media promotion, and other marketing materials.\\n\\n**Further Speculation and Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe title \"Romantic Comedy\" and the vintage aesthetic of the cover suggest a story that explores themes of love, relationships, and humor within a retro setting. The choice of a female protagonist driving a convertible might symbolize empowerment and a break from traditional gender roles. The endorsements hint at a well-written and engaging narrative that resonates with readers on an emotional level.\\n\\n**Target Audience:**\\n\\nThe image likely targets readers interested in romantic comedies, particularly those who appreciate a vintage aesthetic and witty writing. The endorsements from established female authors suggest a potential appeal to a predominantly female readership.\\n\\n**Marketing Strategy:**\\n\\nThe image\\'s clean design and clear messaging make it effective for various marketing channels. The combination of author portrait and book cover provides a comprehensive introduction to both the author and her work. The inclusion of endorsements and bestseller status adds credibility and encourages purchase consideration.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': 'This photograph captures a candid moment of two men, seemingly musicians David Byrne and Brian Eno, inside a Chemist Warehouse, a prominent Australian pharmacy chain. The image is rich in detail, showcasing not only the individuals but also the vibrant, bustling atmosphere of the store.\\n\\n**The Men:**\\n\\n* **David Byrne (left):**  Recognizable by his distinctive features and attire, Byrne stands slightly to the left of the frame. He is known as the former lead singer and guitarist of the influential new wave band Talking Heads. His musical career spans decades, marked by innovative work in various genres, including rock, funk, and world music.  He is also a visual artist, writer, and cyclist, known for his advocacy for urban cycling.  In the photograph, he wears a dark blazer over a dark, subtly patterned shirt and dark denim jeans. His expression is relaxed and approachable, almost as if he\\'s engaged in conversation.\\n\\n* **Brian Eno (right):**  Standing to the right, Eno, a renowned music producer, composer, and visual artist, complements Byrne\\'s presence.  Eno\\'s career is marked by pioneering work in ambient music and electronic music production. He has collaborated with numerous artists, including David Bowie, U2, and Coldplay, and is considered a highly influential figure in the music industry.  In the image, Eno wears a dark fedora, a dark blue plaid blazer, a black undershirt, and dark trousers.  He sports a full beard and a calm, almost contemplative expression.\\n\\n**The Setting: Chemist Warehouse**\\n\\nThe backdrop of the photograph is unmistakably a Chemist Warehouse. Several key visual elements confirm this:\\n\\n* **Bright Blue and Yellow Signage:** The dominant colors are the signature bright blue and yellow of the Chemist Warehouse branding. These colors are visible on the shelves, price tags, and promotional signs.\\n* **\"Cheaper @ Warehouse Prices\" Slogan:** This iconic slogan is clearly visible on yellow signs hanging from the ceiling, reinforcing the brand identity.\\n* **Product Placement and Pricing:** The shelves are stocked with a variety of health and beauty products, typical of a Chemist Warehouse.  Prominent brands like Colgate, Olay, and Nature\\'s Way are visible. The yellow price tags with black text are a characteristic feature of the store\\'s pricing strategy.\\n* **\"As Seen on TV\" Stickers:**  Many products feature circular stickers stating \"As Seen on TV,\" a common marketing tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.\\n* **\"Health Break\" Signage:**  The \"Health Break\" logo, a part of Chemist Warehouse\\'s branding for its health product sections, is visible on several shelves.\\n* **Metal Grid Shelving:** The metal grid shelving units are a standard fixture in Chemist Warehouse stores.\\n\\n**Composition and Details:**\\n\\nThe photograph is composed with the two men positioned centrally in the aisle, with shelves of products flanking them on both sides. This creates a sense of depth and draws the viewer\\'s eye towards the center. The aisle appears well-lit, likely due to fluorescent lighting typical of retail spaces.\\n\\nThe shelves are densely packed with products, creating a visually busy backdrop. The bright colors and varied packaging of the products contribute to the overall vibrancy of the scene.  The price tags, with their bold yellow and black design, stand out against the colorful products, emphasizing the store\\'s focus on value.\\n\\nThe \"3\" signs hanging from the ceiling, indicating further discounts, are a common promotional tactic used by Chemist Warehouse.  The \"Discount Chemist 50% Go\" sign suggests a sale or special offer on selected items.\\n\\nThe floor appears to be a light-colored tile, typical of retail environments.  A circular floor sticker, possibly indicating social distancing guidelines, is partially visible near Eno\\'s feet.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:**\\n\\nThe photograph presents a striking juxtaposition of the two renowned musicians against the backdrop of a busy, everyday retail setting. The contrast between the artistic personas of Byrne and Eno and the commercial environment of Chemist Warehouse creates a sense of intrigue. The image captures a seemingly spontaneous moment, lending it a candid and unposed feel.  The vibrant colors, dense product displays, and prominent branding of Chemist Warehouse create a visually stimulating environment that further enhances the photograph\\'s impact. The presence of text throughout the image, from product names and prices to promotional slogans, adds another layer of detail and context. This photograph is not only a portrait of two influential musicians but also a snapshot of a particular time and place, capturing the essence of a ubiquitous Australian retail experience.\\n',\n",

       "   'description': \"The image features a middle-aged man with dark skin and greying hair sitting in a mostly empty movie theatre. He is the focal point of the photograph, and the composition uses a shallow depth of field to draw attention to him while blurring the background.  He appears thoughtful or perhaps contemplative, his expression neutral and his gaze directed towards the camera.\\n\\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the image's various elements:\\n\\n**The Subject:**\\n\\n* **Appearance:** The man appears to be in his 50s or 60s.

He wears glasses perched on top of his head.\\n* **Attire:** He is dressed in a light blue and white checkered long-sleeved shirt with a button-down collar. The shirt appears to be made of a lightweight, possibly cotton, fabric.  He wears dark-colored pants, likely navy blue or black, which are partially visible.  A dark-colored watch with a light brown band is visible on his left wrist.\\n* **Body Language:**  The man's hands are clasped in front of him, resting on his lap. This gesture, combined with his facial expression, suggests a contemplative or introspective mood. He sits slightly angled towards the camera, engaging the viewer directly.\\n* **Overall Impression:** The man projects an air of quiet dignity and seriousness.  His attire is casual yet neat, suggesting a relaxed but respectful demeanor.  His posture is relaxed but not slouching, indicating a sense of composure.\\n\\n**The Setting:**\\n\\n* **Location:** The setting is clearly a movie theatre or auditorium. The rows of red seats and the dim lighting are characteristic of such venues.\\n* **Seating:** The seats are upholstered in a rich, dark red fabric, likely velvet or a similar material. They are arranged in tiered rows, typical of a cinema or theatre. The seats appear to be well-maintained and relatively new.\\n* **Lighting:** The lighting is subdued, creating a dramatic atmosphere.  Two warm, yellowish lights are visible in the background, possibly wall sconces or ceiling fixtures. These lights are out of focus, contributing to the depth of field effect.  The overall lighting is low, suggesting that the photograph was taken during or just before a screening.\\n* **Ambiance:** The empty seats surrounding the man contribute to a sense of solitude and quiet contemplation. The darkness and the soft glow of the background lights create a peaceful, almost meditative atmosphere.\\n* **Background:** The background is intentionally blurred, drawing the viewer's attention to the man in the foreground. The rows of red seats recede into the darkness, creating a sense of depth and scale.\\n\\n**Composition and Technical Aspects:**\\n\\n* **Focus:** The photograph uses a shallow depth of field, with the man in sharp focus and the background blurred. This technique isolates the subject and emphasizes his presence in the frame.\\n* **Framing:** The man is positioned slightly off-center, creating a balanced composition that adheres to the rule of thirds.  The framing allows for ample space around him, enhancing the feeling of solitude.\\n* **Color Palette:** The image is dominated by warm tones, primarily the red of the seats and the yellowish glow of the background lights.  The man's blue and white checkered shirt provides a subtle contrast to the warm hues.\\n* **Lighting and Shadows:** The low lighting creates soft shadows on the man's face, adding depth and dimension to his features. The shadows are not harsh, contributing to the overall contemplative mood of the image.\\n* **Image Quality:** The image appears to be of high quality, with good resolution and detail.  The colors are rich and vibrant, and the textures of the fabric and the man's skin are clearly visible.\\n\\n**Possible Interpretations:**\\n\\nThe image invites several interpretations. The man's contemplative expression and the quiet setting could suggest:\\n\\n* **Reflection:** He might be reflecting on a film he has just seen or is about to see.\\n* **Solitude:** The empty seats around him emphasize a sense of solitude and introspection.\\n* **Waiting:** He might be waiting for a film to begin or for someone to join him.\\n* **Contemplation:**  His expression suggests a thoughtful state of mind, perhaps pondering something unrelated to the cinema setting.\\n\\n**Keywords for Image Retrieval:**\\n\\n* Man\\n* Portrait\\n* Movie theatre\\n* Cinema\\n* Auditorium\\n* Red seats\\n* Contemplative\\n* Thoughtful\\n* Solitude\\n* Empty seats\\n* Dim lighting\\n* Shallow depth of field\\n* Checkered shirt\\n* Glasses\\n* Mature adult\\n* African American\\n* Waiting\\n* Reflection\\n\\n\\nThis detailed description provides a comprehensive analysis of the image, covering the subject, setting, composition, and possible interpretations.

They are watching the movie clip on a laptop.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** Even today, the movies still terrify her.\\n\\nA clip from the movie is shown again, this time depicting the ground splitting open.\\n\\nThe scene cuts back to the two women on the couch.\\n\\n**Woman 2:** It\\'s hard to watch.\\n\\nWoman 2 begins to cry.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** What\\'s that bringing up for you?\\n\\n**Woman 2:** I just lived in fear of what my future looked like if I wasn\\'t doing exactly what I was told to be a good Christian and to follow an extensive set of rules and expectations of life. And so the fear was prominent in there all the time.\\n\\nThe scene shifts back to the beach, with the woman looking out at the ocean. The narrator says that Amy lived her young life constantly nervous that if she did something wrong, demons would grow inside her.\\n\\n**Woman 2 (in a different setting):** The word that my dad used was they were manifesting inside me. And that number would multiply until I had potentially thousands of demons inside me, which would be harder and harder to remove and to get rid of.\\n\\n**Woman 1 (in a different setting):** What were you doing that was wrong? What was considered bad behavior?\\n\\n**Woman 2:** Even something as simple as listening to non-Christian music or reading a book that was non-Christian would be considered bad behavior.\\n\\nThe scene returns to the beach, with the woman now sitting and watching the sunset.\\n\\nThe narrator says that both Amy and Katrina left the church as young adults. The scene shows Katrina, a woman with long brown hair, standing by a river at sunset, looking at a city skyline.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a night scene of a highway accident. A police car is heavily damaged, and a truck is visible in the background. The narrator says that neither Amy nor Katrina were shocked to hear of the link between the extreme sect and the tragedy on the Melbourne Freeway in 2020.\\n\\nA group of people in suits are walking down a city street. The narrator says that they can understand why the trucking boss, Simon Tuteru, thought prayer would fix the drug-addicted truck driver\\'s problems.\\n\\nA man with a white beard is shown praying, placing his hand on another man\\'s head.\\n\\nThe scene cuts back to the woman with long brown hair from the beginning.\\n\\n**Woman:** When I heard about the news, no doubt at all. I just was like, that is bang on what they do.\\n\\n**Woman 2:** The fact that he believed in voodoo and didn\\'t see it as someone who needed serious help doesn\\'t surprise me at all. And yeah, he believed that what he was doing was the right thing.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** And instead of telling him to get help,\\n\\n**Woman 2:** He prayed with him and cast a spell out of him.\\n\\n**Woman 2:** For the Potter\\'s House, that\\'s just normal. And something that they genuinely believe. In reality, I feel like anyone else would have known how to respond in that situation.\\n\\nA bald man is shown looking out a window with orange-tinted glass.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** Do you feel some remorse, even guilt, when you do hear these stories that occurred when you were the leader of the church?\\n\\n**Bald Man:** Absolutely. And you know, the first couple of years that I came out of the Potter\\'s House, every time I saw an ex-member, I just began the conversation with an apology. I was certainly never apologizing for any of the extreme acts that you\\'ve you\\'ve mentioned, but you know, I recognized I was a part of it. And I\\'ve been there since I was 19 years old, grew up in it, got very used to it, uh, and just didn\\'t see the errors and the extreme that were there.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** What\\'s your message for pastors in the Potter\\'s House now?\\n\\n**Bald Man:** My my word to the Potter\\'s House leaders would be rejoin the mainstream Christian church, allow them to bring that community correction in areas where they\\'ve overbalanced or gone into extreme. Allow those outside voices that will bring them back before anything else really serious happens.\\n\\nA group of people on a stage are singing and waving money. The narrator says that when Potter\\'s House senior member Simon Tuteru chose to pray for his exhausted truck driver and advised him to get back behind the wheel, four police officers lost their lives.\\n\\nPhotos of four police officers are shown.\\n\\nSimon Tuteru is shown walking down the street with two other people. The narrator says that three months after the tragedy, Victoria Police charged Tuteru with four counts of manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty, and a trial date was set. But in October last year, inexplicably, the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions dropped all the charges.\\n\\nSimon Tuteru is shown walking through a parking lot.\\n\\nThe narrator says that these days, Simon Tuteru is no longer a pastor but is still a senior member of the church. When they contacted him, he refused to tell them anything about what happened on that terrible afternoon three years ago. The church also wouldn\\'t comment.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s House Church building is shown from an aerial view.\\n\\nA man with long white hair and a beard is sitting on a couch with Woman 1. They are looking at a photo album.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** How does it feel then knowing that Simon Tuteru is a free man? He\\'s still attending church. He\\'s getting on with his life.\\n\\n**Man:** Frustrated that he is. Frustrated he\\'s not faced court for anything. And it riles to to anger almost. That\\'s how it feels. Shouldn\\'t have happened.\\n\\nThe man points to a photo in the album of a woman sitting on a deck at sunset.\\n\\n**Man:** That\\'s the sunset where our house is. And there she\\'s sitting on the deck with that sunset.\\n\\nThe man points to another photo of the same woman smiling in a car.\\n\\n**Man:** But Stuart Schultz is even more angry about the continued existence of the Potter\\'s House Church.\\n\\nA banner on a fence reads, \"COME AND RECEIVE A MIRACLE. HOPE, JOY, PEACE, HEALING, LIFE, A NEW FUTURE.\"\\n\\n**Man:** Now that he understands the role the church played in the death of his wife and her three colleagues, he\\'s calling for an inquiry into the church to make sure more accidents like this don\\'t happen again. There\\'s three levels of blame. The driver of the truck, uh, Tuteru, he was the manager. If Potter\\'s House is what\\'s influenced Tuteru to make those decisions to make single drive back on the road, uh, they\\'re to blame as well.\\n\\n**Woman 1:** So justice for you now means everyone who had a role\\n\\n**Man:** Yes.\\n\\n**Man:** They\\'ve got to be held to account for Kevin, Josh, and Glenn, and Lynette, and their families all need to have closure. They all need to have justice.\\n\\nA clock face with the words \"60 MINUTES\" is shown. The second hand moves from 0 to 30 seconds. The words \"COMING UP\" appear.\\n\\nA montage of clips is shown, featuring Hugh Sheridan in various roles and settings.\\n\\nA woman with short blonde hair, wearing a red suit, is sitting on a stool in front of a red curtain. A poster behind her reads \"WHO\\'S HUGH?\"\\n\\n**Woman:** There\\'s no dispute. Hugh Sheridan is one of the nicest people you could ever meet. On screen and in the theater, he\\'s also one of Australia\\'s finest and most loved actors. So, how does anyone make sense of this? In 2020, he became the target of a vile hate campaign that almost broke him. And the reason he was attacked so viciously…\\n\\nThe word \"NEXT\" appears.\\n\\nThe clock face with \"60 MINUTES\" is shown again.\\n\\nThe woman in the red suit is shown again.\\n\\n**Woman:** …is attacking an ally, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nHugh Sheridan is shown in an interview setting.\\n\\n**Hugh Sheridan:** I would have thought so, yeah.\\n\\nThe word \"NEXT\" appears again.\\n\\nThe clock face with \"60 MINUTES\" is shown again.\\n\\nThe woman in the red suit is shown again.\\n\\n**Woman:** Goodbye, job.\\n\\nA shirtless Hugh Sheridan is shown with tape over his mouth and the word \"FRAGILE\" written on it.

He emphasizes the importance of targeted relief for low-income individuals facing high rents and interest rates, suggesting rent assistance as a viable option. He cautions against broad-based relief, arguing that it could exacerbate the situation.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to a woman named Shantel Schmidt, a freelance writer, who recently experienced a significant rent increase of $700 per fortnight.  She is shown using her laptop, presumably managing her finances or seeking information about her rights as a tenant. The visuals shift between close-ups of her face and hands on the laptop, conveying her concern and the practical steps she\\'s taking to address the issue.\\n\\nThe narrator explains that Shantel and her housemates are planning to take their case to the tenancy tribunal. If they are unsuccessful, she might be forced to move out, becoming another victim of out-of-control inflation.\\n\\nThe scene changes to Shantel discussing the situation with a reporter in her kitchen. The reporter asks her about the concept of a \"fair go\" and whether she believes her situation aligns with it. Shantel acknowledges that everyone is feeling the pinch of inflation but expresses her belief that some people are taking advantage of the situation while others are struggling. She calls for greater empathy and fairness in dealing with the challenges posed by inflation.\\n\\nThe segment concludes with the show\\'s host wrapping up the regular program and inviting viewers to engage with the show on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.

       "   'description': 'Sure, here\\'s the detailed description of the video from 1800 seconds to 2400 seconds.\\n\\n**Category**\\nNews\\n\\n**DetailedDescriptionOfEventsAndConversations**\\n\\nThe video segment begins with a man in a suit walking down a city street. The narrator states that the man, Chris Ridgeway, profited $1.6 million from a questionable global financial scheme. The narrator adds that millions more invested by Ridgeway\\'s clients are now missing. Ridgeway claims he doesn\\'t know what happened to the money, although he says others likely do.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a parking garage, where a man in a gray hoodie is shown. The audio plays Ridgeway stating that David Sutton would know where the money went.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to Ridgeway in a blue and white checkered shirt, sitting in a dimly lit room with a potted plant behind him. He reiterates that David Sutton would know where the money went, suggesting the reporter ask Sutton if given the opportunity.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a red blazer and a necklace. She appears to be in an interview setting.\\n\\nRidgeway is shown again, this time looking to his left with a slightly surprised expression.\\n\\nAn aerial shot reveals a large house with a pool, nestled among trees. The narrator states that David Sutton lives in a wealthy suburb on Sydney\\'s Northern Beaches.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a black blazer, walking towards a closed garage door. She approaches a side door and knocks several times, calling out for David Sutton and identifying herself as Adele Ferguson from 60 Minutes.\\n\\nThe scene briefly returns to the aerial shot of Sutton\\'s house.\\n\\nThe woman in the black blazer is then shown using her phone, presumably trying to contact Sutton. The scene changes to a beach setting, where the same woman is standing on the sand, holding her phone to her ear. Sutton\\'s voicemail message plays, indicating that the call went unanswered.\\n\\nA close-up of a phone screen shows a text message conversation. Sutton replies to Adele Ferguson via text, stating that his legal advice is not to speak to the media.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a brick house with a white door. A woman with dark hair, wearing a gray jacket and pearl earrings, knocks on the door. The narrator explains that they also tried to contact Sutton\\'s business partner in England, Andy Turner, to inquire about the missing money.\\n\\nThe camera focuses on a window of the brick house.\\n\\nThe woman at the door is shown again, this time speaking to a man who answers the door. The man is bald, wearing glasses and a dark gray t-shirt. He appears to be on the phone. The woman asks for Mr. Turner.\\n\\nThe narrator states that Turner sent a statement denying any wrongdoing.\\n\\nRidgeway is shown walking in a park area, carrying his suit jacket over his arm. He is wearing a light pink and white checkered shirt and a red and white striped tie.\\n\\nThe scene cuts back to Ridgeway in the dimly lit room, now wearing a watch. He says that he\\'s been hung out to dry and that he\\'s been the fall person in all of this. He adds that others are happy and have done nothing to help him.\\n\\nThe scene changes to a room with a large oval table, where several people are sitting and talking to a woman in a red and black patterned blazer. The woman is holding a pen and paper. One of the people at the table mentions intermediaries getting paid a lot of commission. Another person states that the people who trusted their money with Ridgeway have no sympathy for him.\\n\\nThe scene focuses on a man with short graying hair, wearing a blue and white checkered shirt. He says that it\\'s time for action to be taken.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a woman with short white hair, wearing a dark blue shirt. She suggests that the directors of the entities they invested in are likely planning their next company.

He is identified as former senator John Williams, who has been trying to help the investors who lost their money. He criticizes ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission) for being ineffectual. He accuses ASIC of being the definition of frustration and says that they have been trying to get ASIC to act for 11 years. He adds that there is no fear of punishment for wrongdoing, as people can siphon off commissions, break the law, and steal money without consequence.\\n\\nThe woman in the red and black patterned blazer asks what message this sends to criminals when ASIC doesn\\'t act.\\n\\nThe former senator replies that it sends a message that there is no fear of punishment.\\n\\nRidgeway is shown walking in a covered walkway, wearing a blue and white checkered shirt. He says that after years of deceit, finally coming clean to his clients and family has been his only option. He is asked what he thinks will happen. He replies that he may never be able to be a financial advisor again, may not be able to be a company director, and may end up being charged with fraud and going to jail. He expresses fear and horror at this prospect.\\n\\nThe woman in the red blazer asks Ridgeway if he says he\\'s sorry for his actions, and if she believes him. Ridgeway\\'s wife, a woman with blonde hair and black glasses, says she doesn\\'t know. She says that she spoke to him at Christmas and was prepared to listen to what he had to say. He told her and their children that he was sorry and wanted to fix things. She later found out that he was having an affair with someone else, which was another level of betrayal and lies. She says she doesn\\'t know the answer to whether she believes him.\\n\\nThe woman in the red blazer asks Ridgeway what he would say to his wife and kids. Ridgeway, now crying, apologizes and says he didn\\'t mean for this to happen. He just wanted them to have a good life.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to a graphic with the title \"The Confession\" and the producer\\'s name. A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a black blazer, sits in front of the graphic. She states that Ridgeway\\'s former employer, Shore and Partners, says he deliberately circumvented the company\\'s compliance procedures to deceive them. She adds that Shores is working to compensate the impacted parties. She also mentions that ASIC has permanently banned Ridgeway from any involvement in financial services.\\n\\nThe scene transitions to a graphic that says \"Coming Up.\" A man in a suit is walking on a bridge in a city. He is identified as Victor Gao, a former diplomat and expert in Chinese affairs, who is an unofficial mouthpiece for the communist regime. He says that many people in China consider bans by foreign countries to be a laughingstock because it reveals their weaknesses and inferiority. He adds that Australia should be confident about its own system rather than being threatened by TikTok. He says that such bans are racist and discriminatory.\\n\\nA woman in a red blazer is shown sitting in front of a graphic with the title \"The TikToking Time Bomb.\" She says that TikTok has been banned from Australian government phones and devices due to its Chinese ownership, which has angered the Chinese Communist Party. She adds that the CCP has warned Australia not to treat Beijing as the enemy.\\n\\nA montage of TikTok videos is shown. The narrator says that despite its fun and frivolity, TikTok is in serious strife. The world\\'s fastest-growing social media platform has been banned on government devices in the US, Canada, and across Europe, then in Australia.\\n\\nA woman in a blue and white patterned blazer is shown speaking in front of Australian flags.
