He says that the government has to do what it needs to do to get the outcome it wants. The scene changes to a reporter, Tom Steinfort, standing in a park with a cityscape in the background. He talks about Australia's inflation rate and how it is currently at 7%. He mentions that ten interest rate hikes have been implemented to bring it down to this point. He says it's a problem that won't be fixed anytime soon. The scene changes to a warehouse where workers are handling produce. The reporter says that last year, the price of a head of lettuce soared to over  10.𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑠𝑎𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑓𝑟𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑟,𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝐵𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑜,𝑤ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑎𝑦𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑒𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑒\n",

    " 50. The reporter says that Steven's nearest competitor recently went into administration. Steven says that there's been a huge fluctuation in spending across the board, with high-end spending coming down quite a bit and a huge downturn in spending by local businesses. He says that it's incredibly challenging to run a business at the moment. The scene changes to an interview with Gigi Foster, an economist at the University of New South Wales. She says that these are interesting times to be an economist. The reporter asks her about the flip side for the average consumer, and she replies that it's awful, unpredictable, and uncertain. The reporter says that it's a very good time to be an economist. Gigi believes that people need to strap themselves in because it's going to be a long road out of this crisis. She says there are signs of sticky inflation, meaning high prices will be around for years. She says that sticky prices take a while to budge even if there are economic reasons why they should. She thinks that people are in for more high prices and uncertainty before things get back to anything like they were pre-COVID. She says that no death is okay, but death is a part of life, and more people are being killed by lockdowns than are being saved. She claims that Australia's sluggish economy can partly be blamed on laziness and complacency amongst Australians. She's issuing an urgent call to action, otherwise, she believes Australia will end up in a recession. She says that people need to get off their lazy couches and actually do something, and it will make them feel better too. The reporter asks if the pathway out of this is to start working a bit harder. Gigi says the pathway out is to recognize that people are in a lot of strife at the moment, and it's on everybody's shoulders to try to get out of it, even if it wasn't everybody's fault that they got here. She says the government can't save them, even if it wanted to. The bank and the RBA can't save them either. The way that economies work their way out of recessions is through hard work and pulling up by the bootstraps. The reporter asks what would happen if they don't get this right. Gigi says they can't afford to not get this right, and that inflation is a thief in the night that undermines their standard of living. The reporter says that small businesses are feeling the pressure of the cost of living just as households are. He says that with the federal budget just around the corner, the opposition senator, who used to work for NAB and Deutsche Bank, wants the government to tighten its belt. The reporter says that unless the government tackles the cost of living crisis, they are simply leaving those people to their own devices, and it will be a very grim winter for thousands of Australians. Economist Stephen Hamilton agrees that the time for tiptoeing around the issue of inflation is long gone. He believes the Reserve Bank must raise interest rates on Tuesday, and then the treasurer needs to slash spending in the May budget. He says that when you have this inflationary environment, the calls for help are so loud, and everyone is asking for support. The trouble is, if you provide that support, it's counterproductive. The more money the government hands to people, the more money they have in their pockets to spend, and the more demand in the economy. The reporter says that often, come budget time, the treasurer wants to be the pied piper just flashing cash everywhere. He asks if this is not the year for that. Stephen says that what they need from the treasurer in this budget is an incredible degree of restraint. He says that it takes time to lower inflation unless you want to throw people out of jobs. The reporter says that essentially, unless people are happy to cop sky-high interest rates, this is going to take a while to fix. Stephen says that they can slam on the brakes, but they're going to have high unemployment. He says that Switzerland is very special, and that they're very much specialized in high-end products. He says that Australia is much more into large-scale production, so their business model is totally different. The reporter says that living up to the stereotype has almost made their economy bombproof. Stephen says that Switzerland gets a bad rap as being very boring.

    "  You are an insurance agent specializing in evaluating car accident assessments.\n",
    "  You will be provided with a conversation about a car accident and an image of the damaged car.\n",
    "  You should first read the conversation and look at the image carefully, and then evaluate the coherence of the generated responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.\n",
    "  You will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Give step-by-step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Evaluation\n",
    "  ## Metric Definition\n",
    "  You will be assessing coherence, which measures the ability to provide a coherent response based on the conversation and car accident image.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Criteria\n",
    "  Coherence: It is the quality of being logical and consistent.\n",
    "  In the context of conversation, it refers to the way that ideas and information are presented in a way that is easy to understand and follow.\n",
    "  A coherent conversation will have a clear flow and will not jump around from topic to topic.\n",
    "  The user will also use language that is appropriate for the audience and will avoid making claims that are not supported by evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Rating Rubric\n",
    "  5: (Perfectly Aligned) The image precisely matches the damage described in the conversation, and the response accurately reflects the damaged car part.\n",
    "  4: (Highly Aligned) The image generally supports the conversation's description of the damage, and the response is a suitable representation of the affected area.\n",
    "  3: (Moderately Aligned) The image shows damage that is plausibly related to the accident described, but there might be minor inconsistencies, and the response is broadly relevant but not entirely specific.\n",
    "  2: (Poorly Aligned)  The image and/or the response have significant inconsistencies with the described accident in the conversation, raising doubts about the claim's validity.\n",
    "  1: (Misaligned) The image, response, and conversation have major contradictions or  are completely unrelated, making the claim appear illogical or fraudulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "  STEP 1:  Assess Claim Consistency:  Carefully read the conversation to understand the user's description of the accident and the claimed damage.\n",
    "  STEP 2:  Analyze Image Relevance: Examine the image to determine if the depicted damage aligns with the user's account. Pay attention to the location and type of damage.\n",
    "  STEP 3: Evaluate Label Accuracy:  Check if the generated label correctly identifies the damaged car part as described in the conversation and shown in the image.\n",
    "  STEP 4:  Identify Inconsistencies: Look for any discrepancies between the conversation, image, and label. For example, does the image show damage not mentioned in the conversation, or is the label incorrect for the damaged part?\n",
    "  STEP 5:  Determine Overall Coherence: Based on the previous steps, assign a coherence score using the 1-5 rubric.  Consider the severity of any inconsistencies and their potential impact on the claim's validity.\n",
