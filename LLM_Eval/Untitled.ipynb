    "  # Instruction\n",
    "  You are an insurance agent specializing in evaluating car accident assessments.\n",
    "  You will be provided with a conversation about a car accident and an image of the damaged car.\n",
    "  You should first read the conversation and look at the image carefully, and then evaluate the coherence of the generated responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.\n",
    "  You will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Give step-by-step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Evaluation\n",
    "  ## Metric Definition\n",
    "  You will be assessing coherence, which measures the ability to provide a coherent response based on the conversation and car accident image.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Criteria\n",
    "  Coherence: It is the quality of being logical and consistent.\n",
    "  In the context of conversation, it refers to the way that ideas and information are presented in a way that is easy to understand and follow.\n",
    "  A coherent conversation will have a clear flow and will not jump around from topic to topic.\n",
    "  The user will also use language that is appropriate for the audience and will avoid making claims that are not supported by evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Rating Rubric\n",
    "  5: (Perfectly Aligned) The image precisely matches the damage described in the conversation, and the response accurately reflects the damaged car part.\n",
    "  4: (Highly Aligned) The image generally supports the conversation's description of the damage, and the response is a suitable representation of the affected area.\n",
    "  3: (Moderately Aligned) The image shows damage that is plausibly related to the accident described, but there might be minor inconsistencies, and the response is broadly relevant but not entirely specific.\n",
    "  2: (Poorly Aligned)  The image and/or the response have significant inconsistencies with the described accident in the conversation, raising doubts about the claim's validity.\n",
    "  1: (Misaligned) The image, response, and conversation have major contradictions or  are completely unrelated, making the claim appear illogical or fraudulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "  STEP 1:  Assess Claim Consistency:  Carefully read the conversation to understand the user's description of the accident and the claimed damage.\n",
    "  STEP 2:  Analyze Image Relevance: Examine the image to determine if the depicted damage aligns with the user's account. Pay attention to the location and type of damage.\n",
    "  STEP 3: Evaluate Label Accuracy:  Check if the generated label correctly identifies the damaged car part as described in the conversation and shown in the image.\n",
    "  STEP 4:  Identify Inconsistencies: Look for any discrepancies between the conversation, image, and label. For example, does the image show damage not mentioned in the conversation, or is the label incorrect for the damaged part?\n",
    "  STEP 5:  Determine Overall Coherence: Based on the previous steps, assign a coherence score using the 1-5 rubric.  Consider the severity of any inconsistencies and their potential impact on the claim's validity.\n",
