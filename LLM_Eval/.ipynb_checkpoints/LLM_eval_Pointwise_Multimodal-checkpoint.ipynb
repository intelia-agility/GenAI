    "  You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by AI models. We will provide you with the user prompt,  and an AI-generated responses, video and the segment for which this response is generated.\n",
    "  You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, then look into video segment, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.\n",
    "  You will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Give step by step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Evaluation\n",
    "  ## Metric Definition\n",
    "  You will be assessing coverage, which measures the ability to provide a detailed response based on a the given video segment and requested properties.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Criteria\n",
    "  Coverage: It is the quality of capturing all required detail for each requested property.\n",
    "  In the context of video content capturing, it refers to the way that all the details of the following properties are captured and presented throughly:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Category \n",
    "  - Detailed Description Of Events And Conversations \n",
    "  - Brands,CompanyNames, and Logos \n",

    "  - Key Themes \n",
    "  - People Appearing And Mentioned \n",
    "  \n",
    "  This AI-generated responses will be used for data retrieval. So, it has to be able to capture all the details of a scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Rating Rubric\n",
    "  5: (Perfectly Aligned) The details of the video segment is captured properly for all the requested properties thoroughly.\n",
    "  4: (Highly Aligned) The descriptions captured for each property generally supports the details in the video segment and can be used for data retrieval.\n",
    "  3: (Moderately Aligned) The descriptions captured for each property is captured well, but there might be minor inconsistencies or missed details, and the response is broadly relevant but not entirely specific.\n",
    "  2: (Poorly Aligned)  The descriptions captured for each property has significant inconsistencies with the video segment, raising doubts about the validity and quality of text to be usable for data retrieval.\n",
    "  1: (Misaligned) The descriptions captured for each property has major inconsistencies with the video segment and many information and details are missed casuing a very poor quality of text for data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "  STEP 1:  Assess User Instruction:  Carefully read the user input prompt to understand the user's request and requested information.\n",
    "  STEP 2:  Analyze Video Segment: Examine the video segment for each requested property to to make sure all the requested information are captured in detail.\n",
    "  STEP 3: Evaluate Accuracy:  For each requested property, Check if the generated response correctly identifies the information and details described in the video segment.\n",
    "  STEP 4:  Identify Inconsistencies: for each requested property, look for any discrepancies or missed details between the video segment details and the captured information in the AI-generated responses. For example, if any information is missed, or not captured right for each property separately.\n",
    "  STEP 5:  Determine Overall Coverage: Based on the previous steps, assign a coverage score using the 1-5 rubric.  Consider the severity of any inconsistencies and their potential impact on the data retrieval.\n",

Lucinda says she wants someone who's good with his clothes off, leading to a humorous exchange about \\u201chigh-functioning erection.\\u201d  The scene shifts back to the gathering, where Lucinda discusses her ideal partner with Tori and Natasha. She mentions wanting someone well-established, secure, and confident without a big ego, while Tori expresses her desire for a nerdy guy.
