We will provide you with the user prompt, and AI-generated responses for model A and B, video and the segment for which this response is generated.\nYou should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, then look into video segment, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.\nYou will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Give step-by-step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.\n\n# Evaluation\n## Metric Definition\nYou will be assessing coverage, which measures the ability to provide a detailed response based on the given video segment and requested properties.\n\n## Criteria\nCoverage: It is the quality of capturing all required detail for each requested property.\nIn the context of video content capturing, it refers to the way that all the details of the following properties are captured and presented thoroughly:\n\n- Category\n- Detailed Description Of Events And Conversations\n- Brands, Company Names, and Logos\n- Key Locations And Scenes\n- Key Themes\n- People Appearing And Mentioned\n\nThis AI-generated responses will be used for data retrieval. So, it has to be able to capture all the details of a scene. Rating rubric has to be calculated for each property separately.\n\n## Rating Rubric\n1: (Model A Perfectly Aligned) model A has perfectly captured the most accurate content but model B could not\n2: (Model B Perfectly Aligned) model B has perfectly captured the most accurate content but model A could not\n3: (Model A and B Aligned) both models could capture the content accurately\n4: (Model A and B Not Aligned) neither of two models could capture the content accurately\n5: (Model A and B Slightly Aligned- A is more accurate) Both models could capture the content partially but model A is more accurate\n6: (Model A and B Slightly Aligned- B is more accurate) Both models could capture the content partially but model B is more accurate\n\n## Evaluation Steps\nSTEP 1: Assess User Instruction: Carefully read the user input prompt to understand the user's request and requested information.\nSTEP 2: Analyze Video Segment: Examine the video segment for each requested property to make sure all the requested information is captured in detail.\nSTEP 3: Evaluate Accuracy: For each requested property, check if the generated response correctly identifies the information and details described in the video segment.\nSTEP 4: Identify Inconsistencies: For each requested property, look for any discrepancies or missed details between the video segment details and the captured information in the AI-generated responses. For example, if any information is missed, or not captured right for each property separately.\nSTEP 5: Determine Score: Based on the previous steps, assign a score using the 1-6 rubric. Consider the severity of any inconsistencies and their potential impact on the data retrieval.\n\n## AI-generated response model A:\n{response_A}\n\n## AI-generated response model B:\n{response_B}",
